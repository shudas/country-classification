Wandera turned it on! 8749'!! Good climbs, convergence and a short XC to the beach at Tuoss http://t.co/N6lXTKmOJz
Another tough day at work. Looking at the S end of Woomargama from close to  base, but in a Jetranger. http://t.co/fNUpDaGsgY
The lake smoothocity 100%. Awesome! http://t.co/nmZ0dhWxEm
Spring cloud base http://t.co/obGvq2QFnM
Hang gliding is goooo! A bit of a ridge  run, a few aeros and a few landings. Can't beat the lake.
The lake! Be there in half an hour.
Going to Spring to see if I can get a fly. ETA 11:45
Heading to Spring
Wind seems to be dropping. Heading to Spring hoping for a glass off.
Well I'm not raving about the air, but that was great! Scratchy to start , then a few landings to finish off.
Going to Spring for a quick flap before it gets too windy.
It was a bit S but WTF. Was buzzed by a flock of spine tailed swifts all the way from Siberia! http://t.co/9WYNtLoNI1
Super afternoon at Stanwell. Easy getting 2K in the floater over Mitchell's. New WW cocoon works a treat. 5 flights - time to go home
Just had a quick boat around in great air at Stanwell. My glider seems to have a smaller sister. http://t.co/jySoAsnn7B
Heading up to Moyes and Stanwell tomorrow.
And it's getting better http://t.co/MpXpaopQDV
Where have days like this been all summer? http://t.co/9eIjcb1mgB
Heading to the lake with the floater. Third time lucky?
Anyone up for a swim and a beer? 28 Marrakai st Hawker. Let me know if you are coming round
Nulla Station sky yesterday at about 6 PM. 35 degrees, dusties kicking off till 5 and base at about 15 grand. http://t.co/UjY9BqURAD
You reckon your dog is bad Kari. I just discovered one of our cats has pissed on the toaster! WTF!
Gonna head to Spring in about an hour.
The Duck's new girlfriend is making a difference http://t.co/22OdU3yL84
Aah, Bombo quarry and rock climbing classics like the route " meal replacement " that later fell down! No wonder my fingers barely work!
I'll give Spring a bash at about 1:30, plus I'm going to join the floater party - ordered a Mal the other day
Another great hour in light air at Spring!
Glorious hour soaring Spring in light air. Even the jellies were no dramas
Another tough day at work http://t.co/0il6MPFNGN
Unless it drops in the next hour I'll head out. Ginini is still E, so is Goulburn and its S on the coast. Breeze should stick around.
I should make it round 2:00
Meeting Jonesy at 11 at the Pig bombout.
Nice Autumn flight at the lake.  The odd good bubble to airspace and who knows maybe, beyond! Otherwise smoothicity at about 70%.
I'll be at the G at about 2, long as stays OK
Heading to Forbes. Should be there at 6:30
Not a bad day in the office http://t.co/rx7LV1tbXd

Great flying guys. I had about as much airtime as an emu running into a fence.
Sorry guys - no car and no fun! Good flying!
