Today's second breakfast consisted entirely of home made beef jerk.
12 solder joints in a row, no problems. 13th and final joint and I re melt 2 prior joins  (that were a harder solder). #NotAwesome
Tiny elephant would like to hold your coat.  He's not a jerk like angry octopus. http://t.co/6Qx8ffiwgn
At the pizza place in Biggar. The mayor runs the place!
Silly thing I may have done today: taking bike to a wand-wash and leaving my seat on while washing it. It results in a wet ass.
Kids running a lemonade stand at Landsdown and 11th #YXE. Popcorn and books too.
The song/reading from Exodus at Easter mass really, really reminded me of the singing in Two Corpses Go Dancing.
40k indoor bike ride = sweaty shirt +7k run = friction = sore nipples.  #RunningProblems why didn't I wear nipguard.
Beaver! http://t.co/l1I6lKOdGp
Well honk honk to you too Mr Goose. Honk. Honk.
Holy cap,  just saw 9 police cars racing down College Drive with lights and sirens. Cannot be good.
Run today: nice weather - good, splashed by car - not so great, hi-five from random stranger - good. All told, good run.
Two slashed tires is not a great way to start a Sunday. At least it's biking weather out. #NotAwesome
Baguette swordfight with @jliska today just off Broadway on 10th Street. Onlookers seemed amused.
I must not allow perfect to be the enemy of done. But I also must not let done be the enemy of excellent.
Dear fire stain: you don't have to go home,  But you can't stay on the piece in trying to polish.
Dear fellow drivers: using your wipers alone  is not enough. Brush off your damn car.
5 stalls, 6 urinals, 6 sinks, and only 2 hand dryers. WTF? Anyone see the choke point in the system here?
I really wish there was some kind of law that prohibited political parties from quoting each other out of context in their smear campaigns.
I shrieked aloud like a little kid when the stranger in front of me bumped my phone from my hand and it started rolling across the floor.
Dear brain: please shush up now.  I would like to go to sleep and you are not helping.
Oh good, another form rejection letter from Saskatoon Police. I'm pretty sure I would have been an awesome recruit. #heartbreaking
Today I keep winning conversations--by accident.
Perfect timing at SuperFresh Asian Market this morning: still hot pineapple buns. Win.
And I just melted an hour's work. #whatawaste #NotAwesome
Never managed to bend a drill bit like that without breaking it before.  Praise to appropriate devine figure.
I love breaking up frozen over puddles, especially the hollow ones. #ChildAtHeart
It's all fun until your setting bur goes out of control and gouges the hell out of an earring that was almost done. #ICanFixThat
Won my first 5k race today... Of course it was only a small fun run, but I'm counting it as a win.
Yesterday: yet another Pi day where we tried to go for pie, only to find we couldn't.
And things were going so well until the solder seam split in one of the pieces I'm working on... I didn't want to finish it anyhow. Sigh.
My point is: People must be free to express their own beliefs.  Not told what beliefs they are allowed to have. #pmdresscode
So, if the majority of people don't want women to vote they shouldn't? And forget gay rights, right? Times/opinions change #pmdresscode
First visit to doc at new location. So far 100% of visits have seen paramedics attend. Is this a trend that will continue?
Damn you capillary action. Damn you!
Oh man, sleeping in till I just woke up on my own was glorious.
How in the world can the internet's recipes vary so widely for puffed wheat squares. Like, SO much variation.
Why must warm water burn like lava on my cold skin? That's when I need you most! #IThoughtWeWereFriends
The receptionist at my Dr's new clinic location seems about as smart as a sack of hammers... *sigh* And not a smart sack of hammers either.
Just recycled about 70g of silver into a new ingot. #IrrationallyExcited http://t.co/whAAhTqnZe
Hmm, I simply must stop burning the hair on my hand off with a torch. #MakingJewellery
If you thought #YXEroads were bad, I dare you to try  #YXEsidewalks
Apparently it is International Polar Bear Day... So, remember everyone's favourite non koala bear. #PolarBearDay

 was watching this #DrWho episode today
Went for 10k run this afternoon. Was reminded, brutally, how much training I've been NOT doing the last 5 months.
Many thanks to the asshat who drove 150k/h down the shoulder of the #1 yesterday. I really wanted a stone chip in my month old windshield.
Well after a +2700km road trip I still like the new car. Good sign.
Thank you #HomesteadInnBanff for mis- booking my reservation by a month. I really enjoyed driving around Banff at midnight looking 4 a room.
SNOW! @Apexmountain http://t.co/0g0GRjcTm9
There is a squirrel chirping outside our window and hopping around in circles. Weird. http://t.co/gFbjYJtaaY
Everything is creepy in the fog.
Just finished the #Love2Run around the beautiful Bow River. #yyc http://t.co/YyfNl1xMt8
Drinking at Margaritas in downtown Calgary. Jasmine got a beergarita. http://t.co/YEzt1sQoai
We're an inclusive country and that's why it's offensive that you wear your hijab during your citizenship ceremony. #PMHarper so dumb.
I will be adding more stuff to my website (makeyourmarkmetalwork.ca) over the coming weeks, but feedback is welcome whenever.
My new website is finally up (same address): makeyourmarkmetalwork.ca 
Feedback would be super welcome.
Hooray my new wetsuit arrived today and fits like a glove. A tight full body neoprene glove.
For some reason writing a will feels like some kind of suicide note. No wonder people put it off, you have to confront your own mortality.
So we finally have our new car. It's black, not a color we'd really considered. Good deal too, else we'd have gone elsewhere.
Well screw you #SaskatoonHonda it takes you 3 weeks and a call from me to learn you can't get the car I paid for / ordered?  WTF?
Hmm, there is an entire bed... I should probably lay in this box of sewing patterns. 'Cause I'm a jerk! http://t.co/THKWsGcgN2
Why is it we only seem to support the #RCMP when a member is murdered? They are working for us every hour of every day.
The most solid food at supper tonight was the shortbread...

Just something really satisfying about sharpening one's pocket knife to a razor's edge.
An early morning "rescue" after a night outside.  Training night for #SaskatoonSAR #yxe http://t.co/tYmkAN3XB2
Our new bedsheets are flannel with moose and snowflakes on them. #SoNotGrownUp
Just paid the deposit to order a new Honda Fit DX... now we wait 4 to 8 weeks for its arrival. I hope 4.
Finally, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  Shame it waited till January 2nd.
Awesome way to start the day (well, almost end if you realize I'm working nights).  No frost on my windshield makes me happy.
Best lights I've seen in a while. Clinkskill Cres. Saskatoon. Whole programmed show with music. http://t.co/tjJITEBEvs
I for one did not realize that a bag of chestnuts would start to mold. Especially so quickly.
Made cookies with @jliska then I put them in the oven... But I forgot to take the plastic wrap off. #whatawaste #NotAwesome
Jasmine is using 2 strands of Christmas icicle lights as an extention cord to charge her phone. Oh my.
Food tonight from Keos was so spicy that we had to drink like 2 glasses of milk each.  Eating shouldn't be so hard.
Uhg brutal headache. Probably the first time I've taken an Advil in like a year or two. Bed time I guess.
Just sitting here working in a commission from #flockandgather for a set of Pacman cuff links. Woo Pacman!
#flockandgather #winterwonders14 was a blast. Thanks everyone who came out. Merry Christmas / secular winter season.
Thanks to my awesome - sauce friends @MarlaBakes and @terrinamorgan  for stopping by the booth tonight (or does it count as last night?)
#flockandgather #winterwonders14 show is going great.  Might run out of most stuff before the end of tomorrow!
Lost a $200 sale you a broken clasp and slow thinking on my part.
Set up at #flockandgather #winterwonders14 and even a photo now. http://t.co/qZjtnY5Duh
#flockandgather #winterwonders14 set up for the show and ready to go.  Whew.
Today is the day. #flockandgather #winterwonders14 starts in about 8 hours. So excited.
How the deuce does a nearly molten piece of silver break apart into 3 pieces and explode on my soldering bench?
Jasmine is trying to get me too move out to the shop for the next 4 days to prep for #winterwonders14
4 days till #flockandgather #winterwonders14 can I panic yet? Seems like I can!
It's 9:20am and my elbows are already sore.  It's going to be a long workday of training.
I always seem to forget just how good a conductor of heat silver is. It's pretty darn good at it.
New piece for #flockandgather #winterwonders14 hello there little chickadee http://t.co/7TmnOBeFF4
Just in time for @flockandgather #winterwonders #yxe some new pieces to celebrate that winter can be lovely. http://t.co/DKckfw4lDn
Why do I keep ending up with more than a half dozen pliers on my desk at once? #workplacechaos
Workbench now 6" taller than before. I hope that this is a good change, 'cause major PITA.
#NotAwesome unscrewing the last screw holding something heavy to a wall and realizing that there's something connecting it to the wall still
Trying to re-upholster my office chair. Turns out it's not even pretend wood. It's some strange blue waffle plastic.
Saw some geese migrating South today.  Methinks they left it a little later than they ought to have.
Saskatoon Search and Rescue group near Lintlaw. Subject was found. http://t.co/g4g5vAebks
Parked the car at home last night at exactly 200,000km. A neat coincidence.
Is it wrong that &gt;15% of our grocery budget goes to Christies Il Secondo? I mean I love bread, but...
It looks like I am wearing glitter lately, but really it's just silver dust (and a little bit of fabulous).
Today jus seems like one of those days where nothing goes right.
Remember, remember the fifth of November. The gunpowder, treason, and plot.
At 2am, 3hours later than I'd meant to go to bed, finally finished the piece I was working on... Well almost finished http://t.co/MJRVYJeP7a
But most frustrating thing today: melting piece I'm soldering into the wire mesh it was sitting on. Hours of work ruined.
Few things more frustrating than going to rouge polish on a piece and finding out you need to go back to 400 grit sandpaper.
Rain in November? What the hell, where's the snow?
Made myself a new hammer! http://t.co/111Ds2Z61B
Why is there always a train when you're in a rush? Or, at least today...
Just saw The Highest Step In The World @persphonethea Super cool and definately worth seeing.
Dodgeball blow-out, lost 20some to 4... Still had fun.
Better late than never. Halloween decorations are now up. Brrr

Random Thurs night and not a parking space at the Shaw Centre. Seems like not enough spaces.

Damn! Home all day, then leave the house for less than an hour and UPS decides that's the time to come. So annoying. Wish I could pick up.
