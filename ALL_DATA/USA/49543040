I just spent a small portion of my Friday playing on the swings at my office. Who says the real world sucks?
All I want in the world is adequate sleep, my diplomas and 50,000 pairs of shoes, of course.
Just got an email that Apple Pay will soon be compatible with Desert Schools. ðŸ™Œ
Do you even turn 22 if you don't post something about feeling 22?
I've gotten more birthday wishes on LinkedIn than Facebook. #22
This game.... And I don't even like basketball. #MarchMadness
Elated to announce I've accepted an offer with Sprouts Farmers Market as a Communication Specialist. Real word, here I come!
I don't think anyone understands my @QuestNutrition addiction.
Thankful for @Nordstrom and their awesome customer service! My order was likely stolen off my porch and they sent another one on them.
Had to valet park my car to go to spin class because of St. Patrick's Day. #Tempeproblems
Ordered my cap and gown. 54 days. #eek
Might have changed my flight to the last one out to avoid leaving L.A., but I'm finally AZ bound. Thanks for a great weekend, @karadiise!
Trying to pack a bunch of shoes I won't wear will forever be my downfall.
Spontaneously booked a flight today to go see @karadiise this weekend. My wallet hurts, but bye Arizona.
I thought I was going to avoid any pre-graduation freak outs but then I started apartment shopping.
Online shopping for Vegas in class because 4 days until spring break.
One month until my birthday and I'm so already feeling 22. #basic
Done with Mass Communication Law forever.
Look at my inspiring friend @Coryhahn34 in the Republic this week. Proud of you, Cory! http://t.co/ebNhiBwHFY
Addicted to @themadisontempe and #partyonabike.
Feeling nostalgic today as I pass on my @AlphaSigASU sweetheart title. It's been a great 3 yrs of friendship with you boys. #pantherforever
My @CronkitePRLab team Soul Engagement gave a keynote speech to budding HS journalists this morning about PR and social media at #AZALMA15.
Thank you @FOX10Phoenix for this. Llamas on the Loose: The Musical. I get the obsession now. http://t.co/i4cNTY9O4d
Why are llamas on the loose in Arizona breaking national news? I feel like I'm missing something.... CC: @CNN
If there's one thing I can't thank my parents for enough, it's raising me to be a self-sufficient adult.
Consider donating what you'd spend on a coffee or two to support foster children in Arizona. http://t.co/hMZQvLsq3Y http://t.co/wwMcXjGUeM
Gave my senior speech tonight so I guess that means I'm old.
Ugh, I just love @kerrywashington. #Oscars2015
I have no idea what I was doing before I put my mental and physical health first, but I know I'll never go back. #progress
I booked my spring break trip and now I will starve until Friday.
Ecstatic that @Starbucks is offering coconut milk. Not so ectatic about the added chemicals and additives. http://t.co/SRqdBpP7yh
I've been to @ChipotleTweets almost every day this week. No worries though, I got salads. #springbreak
Some kind soul bought my drink today in the @Starbucks drive-thru. Thank you whoever you are!

Can you really be stressed listening to Banana Pancakes by Jack Johnson? I think not.
Officially applied for graduation. Let the countdown begin.
In the last 14 hours I've been home for 30 minutes total. #4monthsuntilgrad
My night is made because I just remembered @ScandalABC comes back tonight. #TGIT
AZ is a cool place to live this week. Just saw the Seahawks leave ASU on charter buses escorted by six officers on bikes. So official.
Feeling a little safer today because the Homeland Security Secretary (@DHSGov) is at @Cronkite_ASU right now speaking.
Good things come to people who work for them.
I went to TPC to pick up Sat tix to avoid lines. I naively though it would be quick. Currently on a shuttle two miles from the course....
Plot twist: absolutely no traffic in Downtown Phoenix during rush hour/Super Bowl week.
Fun thoughts: trying to drive to class in Downtown Phoenix this week, coincidently a mile away from Super Bowl Central.
I found my lost planner, so now I can officially get my life in order.
Love watching POTUS speeches through a #PR lens, knowing the work that went into the remarks and the corresponding @WhiteHouse tweets.
Revenge gives me so much anxiety.
Luck is a classy guy, so I have to root for the Colts. Is so long ago Sunday a thing? http://t.co/4TU2o3oQvR
My dad and I are watching the #GBvsSEA game from a Costco TV. #lowpoint
My recruitment name tag up is up at work and today someone noticed it and excitedly told me they were a Theta too. @BettieLocke everywhere!
Depression because college football is over until August.
Go Ducks! #BackThePac
My roommate is using our large TV to watch Catfish and the CFB National Championship is about to start. Numerous things wrong with that.
I don't care about the #GoldenGlobes, but I care about men in dinner jackets and bow ties.
I need to leave Tempe like yesterday.

Looks like we'll see a Oregon vs. Ohio St. championship game. #CFBPlayoff
I love Twitter and college football. http://t.co/rMzyav8n7A
I'm the proud new owner of an iPhone 6 and college football has been on all day, so I'd say 2015 has been awesome so far.
Marcus Mariota is so humble and classy in interviews, and then there's Jameis Winston.... #GoDucks #BackThePac

Exit counseling for student loans: just in case you forgot how much debt you're in for your degree.
I have a serious jacket and blazer fetish right now. Yet I live in Arizona, so that's problematic.
Today is the day. I'm finally trading my really cool shattered iPhone 4s for an iPhone 6. Moving on up in the world.

Regardless of your feelings about the #VSFashionShow, everything about it down to its timing is genius marketing.
A study break to watch the VS fashion show is okay, right? #VSFashionShow
Interesting stuff. AP distributes style guide of holiday terms. http://t.co/VnNpUOEFqO
I have a final worth 40 percent of my grade Thursday, so that's how my week is going.
Finals are making me emotional, like crying over a fictional character's death emotional. #Revenge
So.many.flags
How awesome would it be if Arizona was completely shut out?
Ugh Oregon, you can't count on winning this game with FGs. #BeatArizona
Tonight I am a huge Oregon Ducks fan. Might even rock the hideous green and yellow. #BeatArizona
I'm limping like a baby deer at the office today because my loafers are painful. However fab shoes over comfort every single time.

I bought a hot drink from @Starbucks this morning purely for the red Christmas cup. Happy December 1st. #basic
Fighting finals stress with chamomile tea, Hallmark Christmas movies, and seasonal candles. Spoiler alert: not successful.
Oh, and scope out #CyberMonday deals of course.
I have an unbelievable amount of homework to do, so I think the only answer is to watch the Broncos game.
Just put down deposits for @FootballASU season tickets for 2015. Merry Christmas dad!
Still love college football, @TheSunDevils, my school and @JaelenStrong. #SunDevilNation
