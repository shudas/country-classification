Sens fans go listen to Gabe Morency interview on tsn1290! The guy is an absolute joke!
Stone with a fractured wrist. Well that really hurts! Was the top dog on the team! Who will step up!
It's only 11:30! I thought I was gonna be up for a while! Well 2 of my 4 teams won tonight. The worst is my favourite didn't. 😞
Sam Bennett, in his second NHL game. Secondary assist and a great great great screen in front
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥FLAMES!

Missed the game. I hate losing! Need a win in game 2! 🍔 will stand on his head. Stone Ryan and Karlsson will all step up!
A moment of silence and Habs are yelling GO HABS! #NoRispeck
I'm sorry Sens. I have practice to go to. Ill be getting updates on my phone and Ill come home to watch the game later. Play your hearts out
My best RTs this week came from: @arcticicehockey @llredraven #thankSAll Who were yours? http://t.co/xdb3bPCqaC http://t.co/72W0XzpkB1
🍔 10 GA in last 6 games. Not a lot of video to go off of to try and beat him. Stone will carry offense! EK WAY BETTER THAN PK @mattleibl
Woah, just found out about the passing of assistant coach Mark Reeds. Thoughts are with the family and the team! #LetsWinItAll
JETS PLAYOFF TICKETS HAVE ARRIVED! nhljets @nhl #NHLJets https://t.co/aKz1Uu0T1V
My shoulder hurts! And I can't sleep! Gonna be a long day!!
On the day where Jordan Speith won his first green jacket, I gotta throw it back to the first time I… https://t.co/wBGsKeEfEp
Are the Sens calling up Bertuzzi for the playoff run?
The Flower Pots begin their floor hockey season next week! Definitely the best looking team out there! https://t.co/SGkAZofvlW
Wow Ted Nolan just got fired from Buffalo! Please tell me how the coach is a fault there? The team is just plain bad! Tim Murray, bad move
A 6th grade math teacher, now Masters caddy champion! Will that be me in a few years?
TIGER EAGLE!
18 days and 3 hours remaining until I am done my practicum! http://t.co/g1XvIUMy7w
Sens first 2 games. Wednesday and Friday at 6pm. Ya I've got hockey at 715 both days! 👎👎👎👎👎👎
And the Leaf firings begin! Good bye entire front office
My phone will automatically autocorrect respect to rispeck by the end of the next 2 weeks
And the Sens and Habs will meet in the playoffs! Bring it on Price!
2 minutes to go! Hold on Montreal!
SENS and JETS finish with identical records. But the SENS are ahead on tie breakers! WAHOO! http://t.co/EojenyOHH1
Either Pittsburgh or Boston will not be in the playoffs. Have fun golfing with LA!
OTTAWA SENATORS - X 

WERE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS!
PAGEAU!!!
🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔 THE HAMBURGLAR HAS GONE BEAST MODE! YOU THINK HES READY?!
They make me happy! And even when I'm mad at them, I'm still kind of happy.
A man can marry a woman or a man. I've heard of some people marrying animals. Can a man marry a team? I'm considering asking the @Senators
How loud was CTC after the Stone goal?!
FULL BODY GOOSEBUMPS
STONNNNNNEEEEEE!! HE HAS BEEN AMAZING
And the penalty is just called on Gamecenter! Unacceptable delays for such an expensive product
PAGEAU ALMOST POTS ONE! Couple good chances early!
OH AMN!!!! STONE HOW DO YOU NOT PUT THAT IN
Ohhh finally the Gamecenter sound starts working. Thought I was gonna be watching in silence
SENS posted pic of Chris Neil in the tunnel?! Is he playing? Oh please no!
ITS GAME TIME! LETS GO SENS! I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS! PUMPED UP!
This picture brings all sorts of joy!  http://t.co/F22qQzexsM
From where I started coaching AAA hockey with the Falcons and then with the Ice, never thought I… https://t.co/eQMDZSHHes
Saying tiger is 12 shots back sounds awful, but he's t15. Good start for tiger! Speith is a beast out there
Penguins win tonight guarantees their playoff spot. Islanders win and it guarantees they wont be in a wildcard. Saturday's game for home ice
It's crazy to think with only 2 days left in the season only 3 spots are guaranteed with NYR, Anaheim and St Louis earned 1st seeds
Please stop cheering for the Jets if you aren't supporting the white out. Move to the maritimes and enjoy the white out outdoors until June
Fan logic
Get team back, call them Jets
Get AHL team back, call them Moose
NHL playoffs are back, no whiteout please
I was there in game 1 of Jets 2.0 and I'll be there for the 1st playoff game too!
ILL SEE YOU GAME 3 AT THE MTS CENTRE! @NHLJets
JETS MAKE THE PLAYOFFS!
OTTAWA SENATORS! WIN AND YOURE IN!
Watching Bostons frustration makes me kinda happy.....😄😃😀😊☺️😉😍
JIMMMMMMYYYY HAYEEESSSSSS
PANTHERSSSSSSSSS 🐯🐯🐯🐯🐯🐯
FLORIDA PANTHERS!!
2-0 FLAMES!!!!
1-0 FLAMES!!!!
Looking forward to Saturday!
Great game gents! Let's all cheer on the Panthers now!
SENSSSSSS
Go @FlaPanthers Go!
I LOVE THE OTTAWA @Senators
Great tip! Great Cely!!
SENNNNNSSSSSSSS
SENS GOALLLLLLL
I just saw the HAMBURGLAR save. Waiting for the MacA goal
🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
He looks at the ref immediately and then as he sees no goal signal, clutches for his knee. PHANTOM INJURY
NOWAY!! RANGER PLAYER PUSHED HIM IN
Chiasson got danced hard!
What were Gryba and Ryan doing there?
No Rick Nash, Mats Zuccarello, or Marc Staal tonight!
Jordan Speith, not human! #MastersWeek
Thursday!!!!
Jets win or Flames regulation win! 
Let's go!
OILERSWIN!
Jets 96
Flames 95
Kings 93

If LA loses tonight and Flames beat LA regulation OR Jet win = Jets playoff bound
Jets 96
Flames 95
Kings 93

If LA loses tonight and Flames beat LA regulation Thursday = Jets playoff bound
SENNNNNNNNSSSSS
THE COMEBACK KIDS HAVE TIED IT UP! THE LOVE IS BACK!
Stuart with a great sell job!
Not giving up, but the odds are not in our favour and I'm also very angry being down 2-0 5 minutes in.
Well the run we had was great! Enjoyed the Hamburglar stretch of winning. Don't think we're coming back from 2 down, and behind in points
Well that sucks
LA and Calgary wins combined with Winnipeg loss is the only way they don't wake up in playoff spot. 
LA vs Edm
Cal vs Ari
Wpg vs STL
Well I might miss OT cuz I gotta go ref now! 😭😭😭 🍔🍔🍔🍔🚨🚨🚨🚨
Spieth with a confident clutch putt
A win tonight makes Tuesday's game so freaking huge! #Sens
This flyers penguins game is awesome
Giroux 2 for roughing
Voracek 10 misconduct 
Bennett 2 for tripping 
Penguin fan game misconduct
Carlton University beat Wisconsin by 15 points last year. Put the Canadian team in the NCAA
Wouldn't it be great if the Bruins get up 4-1 and blow the lead?
LEAFS!!!!
Just landed and find out SENS are up 3-0! WOOOOHAHHHA
Sens take on a depleted Lightning squad. That's great news. Expose the inexperienced D!
4 games for Buff....Winnipeg falls out, LA moves in
Just saw a whale jump up about 100 feet away from shore. Pretty cool! Was within 20 feet of a paddle boarder.
Another huge game upcoming on Thursday! I'll be on a pirate ship during the game so I'm wishing my team GOOD LUCK! Go @Senators Go!
Nothing like watching the #Sens game on your iPhone in Mexico!
SENNNNNNSSSSSSS!!!!!!
AN UNBELIEVABLY HUGE GOAL
CLARKKKKEEEE!!
Wow desperation has set in when your moving Smith up to L2 and Hoffman down to L4
Puerto Vallarta is sunny and hot! Burnt so bad, I have blisters. I'll have another drink to celebrate that!
$20 says Flames, Canucks and Kings win because the Jets can't afford them to
20 plus Jets fans raid the Puerto Vallarta bar to see them lose. Garbage
PS I have had too many drinks and it's only 4pm. Spring break 👍
Where am I off to? @NHLJets game starts at 5pm Puerto Vallarta time. Jets fans all heading to Blakes bar to cheer on the team! #GoJetsGo
It's +30 in Mexico. What am I doing? Enjoying the hot weather, free booze and watching the Sens game! #winning http://t.co/zFHsxcjRsM
Can't tweet and watch the game on the iPad. Too lazy to grab the phone. Finally got up....SENS!!! 2-0!!! WOOO!! ANDY!!! LAZAR!!! STONE!!
Well I'll be watching the @Senators vs Leafs game today from the beaches of Puerto Vallarta! #cominginhot
Who knew missing Milo and Puempel would cause such a catastrophe!
Do we throw microphones and guitars on the ice after Jets wins for Pavelec being "The Boss"? @IllegalCurve @arcticicehockey @TSN1290Radio
Just got out of parent texted conferences. What is going on Sens?
How I did on Twitter this week: 11 Mentions, 3 Retweets, 3.19K Retweet Reach, 29 Favorited. How'd your week go? via http://t.co/M49JKUETPg
As Sens fan did they mean to hold the burgers until after the game? hear on broadcast to hold off or receive penalty. @TSN1290Radio
Oilers are pulling out of the McDavid/Eichel sweepstakes!
