It has to be Mona!
Was Alison tormented by 'A' ?!
I need to watch 54 hours of PLL if I want to catchup before I go back to sixth form
I've watched an unhealthy amount of PLL today
Why were they friends with Alison in the first place? She's just a bitch #PrettyLittleLiars
That had to be the best PLL episode so far

What's happened to the Ultimate Guitar website? It's impossible finding the tabs
Can't stop listening to Future Hearts
I hate being 17, there's nothing to do
This dog gets more of the bed than I do
I hate sharing a room
PLL is getting intense
PLL just keeps getting better
I swear this dog spend most of his time laying on my bed
Touch of class from Liverpool fans
As much as I love Alan Shearer I'm sick of seeing the advert with him
It's all Liverpool
This is going to be a slaughter
My legs just keep seizing up,
How am I covered in cuts again
Biked to Whickham and its started raining, how nice
I'm dead
Only went and made it @ozan2010 http://t.co/pKEqOMNcMz
Nothing more annoying than dog hair
Holy Shit I need an All Time Low ticket
Can't pick my favourite track from Future Hearts
Future Hearts is Amazing
Finally!! @AllTimeLow @AlexAllTimeLow @JackAllTimeLow http://t.co/EsLqKC8eoz
I need more music on my phone
I love Frank Lampard
Christ. That was great
Dogs on Britain's got talent are the best thing ever
I'm sorry but who calls a dog YOLO?
Hate To See Your Heartbreak is such a great song
Why can't I have more storage, I need more music
Can't bare Geordie Shore, utter shit
Is James Bay any good?
Overwhelmed with how productive today has been
Finally finished my extended project
I'm in love with Angels &amp; Airwaves
Research review done, just my evaluation and I've finished my extended project
Nice outing at the beach with the dog
Why am I covered in even more cuts
Really need to stop biting my nails
Can't be bothered to go in today
Love going out on walks
Angles &amp; Airwaves are actually pretty decent
I'm so tired, everything aches
If that bike can get me to shields and back I can get myself to uni
Romantic picnic on a bike ride with Kieran http://t.co/ItNzQiZ2N6

Perfect day for a bike ride
Nothing more fun than playing Green Day's older stuff
Such a nice day for a barbecue
Can't wait for the Avengers
Fuck yes future hearts today
That was a decent PLL finale
Fuck me, again
Hate being stuck in the house on a day like this
Just equalise
We can't lose another one
We need a comeback, urgently
For fucks sake
Fuck. We need a goal
The way my mam goes on when it's Derby day is just ridiculous
Tensions are running high
So nervous for the match
Definitely want to be out doing something in this weather
If we win today I will be over the moon
A win tomorrow would be ideal
