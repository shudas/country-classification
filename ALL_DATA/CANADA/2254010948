Legs are officially dead thanks to PE squat jumps

I'm so clueless 😂

I just got this really big wave of missing home and everyone and I don't know what to do..

example 3: they use absolutely no emojis
example 2: they use "ok" instead of "okay" and if I said ok to a quesnel person they would think I was mad at them
example 1: "brb" means "okay I guess il talk to you in 3 days or so"
it's weird AF texting kids from out of town because they use all this weird slang and text differently and it's hard to fit in with it
can I be in kelowna already?
text me!
roooaaadddd trrriiiipppp
as much as I like skiing, I feel like I'm gonna hate big white just because of its chairlifts and my irrational fear of heights
moms gonna be mad when she finds out im bringing 6 pairs of shoes on a 7 day trip
trying on dresses makes me happy 😍
Happy St patties day, I own nothing green..
i want to be held. i'm not sad or anything, it's just one of the only things on my mind.
how is that even supposed to work 😒
why do i miss people so easily?
so much to do tomorrow
just realized I completely forgot to pack my ski shit 😩
early birthday presents 😏
packing is actually fun when you're really pumped to leave town 😍
