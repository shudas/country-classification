Fuck, I'm ill !!!!!!
Then there is the  shallowness  of breath and the pains in my abdomen and shoulder blade.
I would say is only a bad cough, but I would  not wish to minimise the effects that the accompanying fever, chills and dizziness are having.
Day 2 off work with unidentified respiratory illness. Doctors later.
Eurrrrrrrrrrgghhh.
Well I CAN breathe, just not normally.
Off work today. Way too sick. For example went upstairs for laundry, brought  it down, put it in the washer and now I can't  breathe. #sick
Fever, chest infection, hurts to breathe. #NotWell #NotHappy #NotHavingTimeOffWorkNoSickPay
Just learned what a Chicago Sunroof is. Seems like a good idea to me.....
Freezer food for tea. Best. Thing. Ever.
Hometime! Going home!  Hooray!  Home is ace.
Up at 4.30 (boo). Scored 100% on practice iCMA (yay). #OpenUniversity #DE100
After the glory of Fake Friday on Thursday last week must come the misery of Fake Monday tomorrow.
Woken up by the most awful heartburn. ....so bad that my throat hurts. Banging an extra Lanzoprazole and hoping for the best. :/
People wearing whimsical items of clothing but who have faces like someone shit in their cereal. #Incongruous
Sooooo exhausted, soooooooo low......soooooooooo enjoying Better Call Saul though.
Terrified to realise this morning that I have 2 TMAs, an iCMA and a 1500 word EMA to submit, in under 2 months. #OpenUniversity #DE100 #FML
Can anyone offer me a job tonight please,  so I don't have to go to my current job tomorrow?  Thanks,  greatly appreciated.
Monday again tomorrow. ... #FuckThatShit
Bought loads of beers. Managed 2 before the exhaustion kicked in. #Age #Lighweightism
Can't stop eating crisps. #ComfortCrisps
Mmmmm delicious Salopian Kashmir. Freshen my jaded taste buds with your citussy wossnames.  #BeerTweet #CraftOrNotCraft
Just opened a bottle of Thornbridge Jaipur. ......#heavenly #BeerWin #BlazingThatShitUpAllNight @kerilouu ;)
Work?  On a Saturday? But why?  #AdminWorkerProbz
Changed my mind.  I AM in competition with some people, and based on what I've just been laughing at,  I'm winning.  #Winning
Drank Abbaye des Rocs brune last night. Amazing beer, deadly strong and tasted of black cherries.  #BeerTweet
.@watermelonlippy seems like it's a day for being ignored. #Rude #Unnecessary ;)
Off to bed now, probably cry myself to (not) sleep. #Miz #TryAgainTomoz
.@kerilouu just said this train carriage is as cold and dark as our souls........#Miz
It's unbelievable how badly I want to smoke. .....
So. Miserable. #Miz
Happy Motherfucking Monday. #Shite #Bollocks #BiteMe
I am saved. Managed to withdraw my last tenner and now am travelling legally.
Damn you BT! Now I have insufficient funds and am travelling without a train ticket. #BastardBastardMonday
"I can only do my best and am in competition with no-one but myself." (Me, just now, in the bath) #Mantra #MotivationalMelglee
If Monday were a person I'd kick their bastard head in.
Clearly behind the times, but Neil Young.....and DARYL HANNAH! !!!!!! #ShockedFace
Postman Pat had his black and white cat (JESS!), but as far as I'm aware,  Fireman Sam's landlord did not allow pets. (I can't sleep,  btw).
45 minutes is a fucking long time when you don't smoke and murder is illegal.
Wanted to catch early train....work will have been piling up....queues for tickets a mile long.....missed fucking train. :/
The "unfollow" option on FB has been invaluable. Can't believe didn't utilise this long ago!
Don't want to go back to work tomorrow.  At. All.  If I didn't have a degree to pay for, totally wouldn't do it.
I think I feel better today. ...keeping everything crossed that this is a wobble and not a full blown slide.  #Depression
Failed. Back home. In tears.
Leaving the house. ...wish me luck. ...
Depression has me. The pall has settled over my life. Tough to be here. #Depression
Yeah. I've had enough now.
So very low. Not sure what is happening.
Dermot O'Weary.......I thangyaw! #ComicRelief
Results are in for TMA03 ...... 87%. Slight dip in quality from TMA02 but under the circs, more than happy with it. #OpenUniversity #TMA03
Hike for miles &amp; miles around Whitby over some VERY unforgiving terrain...&amp; crock my entire left leg jumping out of a taxi outside my house.
#Glum
Leaving Whitby for Chester this morning.....which is ok. But then...Monday.....#OperationLifeChange
That's it. Eaten so much this week. All food off limits now for at least a fortnight.  #HolidayBloats
CAMRA dudes in here nursing their pints of fucking Landlord have made me abandon cask ale in favour of gin.  #Gin
