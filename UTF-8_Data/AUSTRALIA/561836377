What happened 2the quality broadcasting we had for the clipsal500? Adverts when we r paying &amp; adverts during interviews!! @FOXSportsAUS #F1
#V8SC @rianacrehan @v8supercars it's fair to say these 12 laps races don't work half the race under safety car boring. Do it properly points
Best thing about @FOXSportsAUS #f1 coverage is not having to listen to Matt White on ten/onehd! God he is annoying!
