U can decide 2 act #Rich next time you R receive UR #income BY living on less than U earn &amp; [a] paying off #debt OR [b] investing/saving.
Being #Rich has more 2do with the ability 2 live without debt than it is about ones #income. #financialplanning #wages #budgeting #mindset
#Rich people save in advance 4 bills &amp; pay them early or on time. #Poor people don't #save in advance &amp; struggle 2 #pay on time or late
#Rich people live off less than their #income while #Poor people require all or more of their #income.
The difference between #Rich &amp; #Poor people R the amount and size of #loans #finance they require! #Poor people need them 4 smaller amounts.

Let me clarify. #Poor = not being able 2 afford something with ðŸ’°. #Rich people [also] often save on the RRP when using #cash.
#PoorPeople need 2 #save in advance 4 items them want - unless U want to pay more for things.
2 people walk into the same shop on the same day at the same time to buy the same item. The person that needs #finance &amp; pays more 4 it.
1 reason "The rich get ðŸ’° &amp; the poor get ðŸ˜©" is because of interest rates. #Rich people don't need loans. #Poor people pay extra. #BecomeRich
