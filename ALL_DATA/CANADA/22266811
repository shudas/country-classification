If its one out of 86400 seconds today it's still something that feels good. A small drop of honey leaves taste for a long time.
Genius is genius. Here's my playlist created from Good Day Sunshine. http://t.co/a8Zx24WnZh
Surprise visitors this morning. #meow http://t.co/NDRnKRsJRz
may all sentient beings be well
The moment I was reading about the book 'The impossible takes longer' a distant relative of the author stopped by and we talked about time.
Unconditional love to be traded in for anything or nothing. Please apply within. #deal #quote
Why not? Try something new for the next thirty days. Start now.  https://t.co/7YjWoOaRfT
Is this the 100th day of the year? Perhaps.
Sitting in Tims waiting for car 2charge while kids next table tell stories of their band practice. Apparently all 3 play sax. #ha #saxlife
Band formed in Banff jazz camp played complex and sometimes dreamy music in SA Jazz Club tonight. Hot moments complex dreams simple life.
No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer! First heard of this song after yoga yesterday. Surprise? #99
It's Easter Monday and it's sunny and I'd be so happy to post something happy. Happy Easter Monday to All!
As the quick charger is broken &amp; I'm stuck here for 5 hours. But at least I met another local #LEAF owner again. #ev http://t.co/f1C6oivnmI
How long can you hold a yoga pose? Does time matter or strength. http://t.co/fbQ5sDJClH
Good day Sunshine!
Loved the presentations this morning on what's coming up. I was already optimistic and I am now. #TheFuture #is #Now
Still at work and if we are quick enough, we'll finish before Earth Hour. Go team go! #EarthHour
Sitting in Bean Scene and spamming friends with txt's. If you haven't got yours yet, I'm thinking of you. Have a beautiful day today. I &lt;3 U
Yes to Yoga this morning.The sun came out and illuminated the room in the middle,saw it with closed eyes. Love the signs on the path. #yoga
#EarthHour display at work. Thanks #sustainabilityteam http://t.co/O1QD66augy
Sometimes I just can't believe how lucky I am. Yes. It's nothing to do with luck. I believe.  #thankyoudearuniverse #miracle
Normal on the surface but see the new green branch that's slowly growing out. New life. Love it. #gardening http://t.co/otMx7v5hIF
Remembering Bartók Béla on his birthday with one favourite piece of music. http://t.co/c8ugdZSmat #bartók #playitloud #firstmovement #last
Can't stop the rain yet. Can only make a small hole on the clouds to let the sun peek in. Lot to learn on this winding road. #weatherreport
Walked out this morning I don't believe what I saw. A hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore.
It must be nice out there. #Sunshine
Listening to Blue in Green. I really love both colours yes I do. They can be light and uplifting and also sad like this song. #blueingreen
Sometimes when things really don't look like the way you imagined....there's the bestest yoga class starting in three minutes...hurry!
A business with a definite plan will always be underrated in a world where the people see the future as random. #zerotoone #newread
A unicorn is sleeping under a dolphin. Yoga is different every morning.
You are my shenpa and I may be yours. Be my Love and let me be yours. Readin a new book from Pema Chödrön #gettingUnstuck
Maybe this #spring thing has smthng to it. Lulu found a mate! 1st time I ever seen anothr #NissanLEAF charging here. http://t.co/ghGupsG0y0
Come on, there's still nine hours from this day. The rain has now stopped. Bring it on Spring and Eclipse and Equinox and New Moon!!!
Happy first day of Spring. It is already but we can still make it. And it's international day of Happiness. Woohoo. Seriously. #spring
Loving your show on #electriccars @onthebeat1 @rborba &amp; others.Lots of useful inforomation. http://t.co/gdZzYVmDdt #NissanLeaf #TeslaMotors
Tomorrow is #InternationalDayOfHappiness, can we start celebrating #today?
All is quiet like a Kurt Elling song.
Beauty in the park today. Do you see what I see? http://t.co/fHygelgn5C
After many challenges taken finally my car stopped me from going to yoga 2nite. At least saw a lil bit of sunshine. Now's time for charging.
Sad to see people good people leaving, embracing change is easy to say. This will pass too.
Back in vs. pull in? Reverse parking is not only safer but you can fly out to ur new dest. safer/faster. Can't start smthg new in reverse.
Ha! Deepak proves the theory.  #expecttheunexpected http://t.co/yBJOhvsXhW
Listening to 1ere gymnopédie of M. Satie brings back memories of x-ings We met. Sure there will be more to come on this winding path. #satie
Going frm 5 times of yoga a week to none puts life in a different perspective.Looking forward to find th other perspective again next week.
Nice bylaw officer asked me if he can try my Uni. He jumped on it n almost rolled a full spin. Did last when he was a kid.Will start again.
Beautiful yoga class again this morning left us open hearted to this sunny weekend and more. So good to be here on this planet. #gratitude
Great concert tonight,virtuoso gelato musica &amp; they shouted Hungaria. Loved it. #thxKarmen #SynchronicityDiary #uniq http://t.co/HCyg8I2unv
Ladies in line are talking about Shoeswap literally by looking at each other's shoes. #onlyinkelowna #prettyshoes
Yes! Things are getting better. This time I made it to the concert on time! Now I'm just hoping to get a ticket. #symphUni #hope #music
Friday. Ready for the weekend? #friday #itwillbenice
Dark magic chocolate saves the days from falling apart. Soon we find ourselves singing songs from West Side Story and Bohemian Rhapsody.
I think I know now. If you need an answer, ask a question.
What's the karmic significance of this? A girl almost like her having lunch with her dad right her in front of me. I better stop texting.
When do you give it up? When signs, odds &amp; circumstances are against you? It's easy to say never. It may be long. Better enjoy the journey.
Today's a reminder that we got everything to get halfway. May not be in order but we can sort them out. #mathisthelanuageoftheuniverse #3415
Today's yoga was about gratitude with some super fun music again, loved every second of it. Even did just one wheel for two. #yoga #arise
Yup. I love this tea. #reality #spelledwiththei http://t.co/5dTjlYPbLM
Just finished listening 2 Deepak's book on synchonicity when a beautiful cluster of them hit me. I better start reading again. #sunny #snowy
Walking with two Fitbit devices in my pocket does give me double steps. I just have to add them up. #mon #day #dreams
Mmm. Something to be happy about at midnight at work. The taste is missing from the picture. #perfectcombination http://t.co/Hb1A1hd4NS
Work work work and no play until ten minutes ago. I did sneak out for a ride in the parking lot. Missing SKU's have no power anymore.
A perfect combination but theUniverse didn't let me takeapic of myCocoLemon muffin I love so much this morning. Recharging my phone helps.
Did my rolling meditation tonight, getting better but w/closed eyes in the dark it's quite stressful.Need to see the road  to keep balance.
It's already a Miracle that we are here and even sometimes things don't look the way I imagined, I ask for and accept all Miracles to come.
Listening to Neunundneunzig Luftballons when realized. So kind and gentle still can't get the lyrics. This will pass says the Buddhist. #99
Or it was the Chot Hocolate. #behappy #first  #wherevertheroadleadsenjoythejourney #RollUpTheRim http://t.co/fpxLQN6fUV
Hmm. Perhaps there was not much to be happy about today but somehow I'm feeling very good. Perhaps yoga, work, play. Or just being here now.
Send love to your bullies in secret, they need it so much.Embrace them and let them go in peace. #PinkShirtDay #peace #love #loveisallweneed
If there are so many ways how and reasons why it wouldn't work, I want to know how it will. I know the why. #self #motivate

I did not run to catch the last seconds of the green light. I may have arrived to the next intersection too soon. Everything is in sync.
It's not only the apple falls to the earth. The Earth falls to the apple too. A little. I hope so. #newtonian #physics #gravity
I'm quite amazed by my own mind. How far I can actually get to prove something negative, through steps and twists and turns. #shhhhh #quiet
A connecting principle,
Linked to the invisible.

A beauty day. Thanks for helping to make it. Let's enjoy it together.
Am I the only one who thinks the Universe is sending messages using license plates? :) That's right. #BWhoUR http://t.co/xh7Dqy7mV5
If you're happy the sun peek out from the cloud. We just did it. Please be happy!!
That's just one beautiful crescent moon tonight.
Yoga make you flexible &amp; love ur life.Enjoy the sunshine w/me.#happyfeet #happyheart #plsdontjudgemeitscompletelysafe http://t.co/iC6LEBcvIP
Every decision I make is a choice between a grievance and a miracle. I let go of grievances and choose miracles. #synchrodestiny #audible
Beautiful yoga class this morning around the first chakra &amp; colour red.Loved music &amp;the crowd.Was so easy to find my letter on the ceiling.
Kindness softness gentleness. To give and to receive. Another quiet moment in a waking dream.
As distance shortens all forces of the Universe get stronger. Perhaps Stephen Hawking will describe it one day. Until then we just feel it.
Smiling and singing peeps in the park! Spring sings here.
Such a beautiful day! May the Sun shine on our belly button!
Django's djam tonight.It's always fun to play w/these great musicians. Such a happy bunch. I suspect the music has something to it. #django
I've decided. I'll learn how to draw. I'll draw a picture of the most beautiful thing I only saw for a moment on my way home.
so simple and light and playful and pure. waking up in the middle of the night in the quiet everything is. follow your heart.
Shiny Venus with pale Uranus follow the Sun &amp; new Moon to Pisces. Dreams &amp; Neptune are home. Happy New Year to All. http://t.co/iPxgY0I7Dw
Get ready for a happy new year while enjoying last minutes of the old. New Moon @ 3:47PST in the last degree of Aquarius. #LunarNewYear
As I heard last night, you don't have to be a PollyAnna, you can still hope for the best in every situation. Even make it. #hope #effort
It's easy for me and it may not be so for you. And there can be smtg I struggle more with. As long we know this, we understand each other.
Please get ready for a Happy New Year.
The Truth is Beautiful. It may just take time to adjust our eyes to see it. #truth #beopen #quote
Everyone is equally creative. It's quite a concept I'm digesting for a while. Fear makes us boring. Love makes us create. #loveisallyouneed
Under the night sky nothing seems impossible.
So many stories I heard tonight. It was great to hear from other humans I work with. And fun too. #dalecarnegie
Meeting Dale Carnegie or at least with his spirit tonight.
all of me loves all of you. woke up yesterday morning to this song being played over and over next door. and still. that's right.
I wish you all could feel this now. #gratitude #love #gratitude
I opened the door, let these nice ppl come out &amp; closed door. Next time: open door, let them out then go in for a coffee. #starbucks #howto
I knew it was going to be a nice walk, Deepak whispered in my ear when it turned into one.
Just found a wedding ring on the bus today. Gave it the the driver, she'll make an announcement. #lostandfound http://t.co/IjRY5BNHX5
"A miracle is not a miracle unless it's recognized" You can tell I'm listening to an audiobook by @DeepakChopra #synchrodestiny #miracle
Today's list of transportation by wheels: 4 1 10 10 2. #howmanywheelsareyourollingon #itsallrubber
I used to strive for excellence but connectedness is something I more value these days. #WeAreOne
We all have incredible stories to tell. Let's just live them now and enjoy the sunshine.
Practiced under the starry sky tonight, played all songs I remembered with stars and love in them. It was such a treat, even for a moment.
This concludes today's #BeanScene moments. Happy #Vday to all, please love each other today &amp; every day. #peace #love http://t.co/Pe8TPcvLhY
10k riding to &amp; from the lakeshore is the same effort as swimming across the lake &amp; coming out w/smile on ur face. http://t.co/hPwhaNycBY
The Universe loves you too. Just look around. Things may not happen in the order or when you want but they do. #live #love #laugh

Wishing all of us good luck today if there's such thing. May the Universe listen to our wishes and sighs. #Friday
Been neglecting my Uni lately. Thought I mastered it enough. But there's always something to learn to get better. Time for a ride is now.
Love is Love.

A chance for Jupiter Ascending tonight #Wachowskis

As it unfolds life makes us full. All these in our backpacks &amp; FB profiles is part of us &amp; not to be denied at all.Be yourself.It's enough.
So grateful. For all this. To see these mating fruit flies while making my morning coffee.
Mercury retrograde messes up communication to all who believe in it &amp; give power to it. For me, I can mess up anything regardless. #b #open
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.Then they let their true self open up &amp; do smthng good too.
Life gets pretty simple when you let love in and fear is pushed out. #let #love #in
Snow tubing was fun with these little ones. The spring has sprung, they said up on the melting snowy hill then wheeeeee.......
Good morning Sunshine! I was dreaming of you all night! :)
My #unicycle training is coming to a completion. I can now ride almost as balanced as a bike or a trike. Learning one little missing thing.
Overnight charging ahead but it was nice to see friends, taste wine and cheese and play with an adorable little one this afternoon.
Usually things work out differently than what I imagine. The Universe has unlimited creativity. I keep imagine. One day it will #match
Old pics found to bring back new memories, to make a bridge between yesterday and tomorrow. Dreams are woven from true and innocent sparkles
After this nice sunny day I'm going to watch The Theory of Everything. A love story about some very smart people. Hoping for a happy ending.
I just stopped myself starting a sentence with I can't. I'll figure out what's wrong, the answer will come to me naturally. #coding #bug
I am grateful for all kind and beautiful people in my life. #unconditionally
The Universe makes us learn before we can get to the next step. How much and when? When the student is ready the teacher appears. #when?
Mon: Work after yoga. Tue: yoga at work. Wed: yoga after work. Thu: yoga at work. Fri: work. Sat: yoga. Sun: ?? #7days will quickly go #y21c
Fitbit or Bellabeat? Or both? New technology helps us to live a healthier and happier life. #fitbit #goodforus
Groundhog Day is today. Phil can't see his shadow here but knows what's above the clouds. And dreams of the other 364 days #PunxsutawneyPhil

A hot guitar trio, dance with an adorable little baby, a sip of Sangre, then sitting in to play a song about Spain #moments #grateful
Love setting my iPod to random play. Brings up tunes I haven't heard for 20yrs but have meaning here&amp;now. #seemingly #randomly
