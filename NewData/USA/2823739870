I think one of my favorite feelings is laughing with someone and realizing half way through how much you enjoy them and their existence
Yass!!  https://t.co/3JplgUMcxM
I get attached to people too fast..
I'm not perfect. I'll annoy you, tick you off but put all that aside, You'll never find someone who cares and loves you more than me.
Sometimes you just gotta do what's best for you.
If I'm with you then I'm completely yours. My loyalty won't change.
Satisfy your Girlfriend: 1) Good Morning Text 2) See Her 3) Kiss Her &amp; Tell Her She's Beautiful 4) Call Her 5) Goodnight Text ;)
She want a hug. Not just a normal hug, one of those tight hugs that take her breath away, give her butterflies, &amp; make her smile like crazy
I trusted you but now your words mean nothing to me because your actions spoke the truth.
It seems like people always want the truth, but never want to be honest.
