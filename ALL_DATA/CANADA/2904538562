wishing I could heal overnight 😔
Caleighs dog is Satan
injuries are so dumb why can't I be invulnerable
Turns out it wasn't a pulled muscle and I actually sprained my knee cap
no need for a dog to eat the leftovers when I got my cat

bell vs franco cite today after school
Weird how gallagher won't give a test after a break but calls the kids cancer?!
waiting for it to ship is killing me
I don't have the patience for online shopping
sleeping schedule so screwed up but still gotta wake up tmr at 6am 🔫
the reason I have no trust is because people screenshot my snapchats
not knowing who's sliding into my dms 😳 @a_lxw

school volleyball game then volleyball practice then morning practice then score keeping boys volleyball game then another vball game etc.

I think my neighbours are deaf... I like my music loud too but not to the point where my eardrums might explode
