2am club. It's been a while.
Bae and I looking dreadful http://t.co/kGQpzgmoU2
Looking forward to a day out of the office tomorrow. @nikelab here I come!
to creatives: make something it'll suck, make another thing it'll suck. Repeat until it's good.
So bored of trying not to die.
Bae keeps trying to impress me with Harry Potter references, but keeps calling Mudbloods 'Mugbloods' I love him too much to correct it.
http://t.co/XU8o71Q8DX lol, bought them. lol can't eat for a month. lol.
Anxiety please be kind today. I really don't want to pass out in work in front of bae.
tbh I just want a nice easy life where I can lay in bed all day and have endless amounts of Ibiza Weeekender to watch.
The struggle is real with anxiety today. fml.
Don't think I'll ever get bored of any @wearegalantis track.
Bae just slapped my backside to get out of the office due to a fire alarm. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chipotle offering me support. Only a week to go and it will be in me. http://t.co/Ys9er8xoS3
The day has arrived. I've finally found a contact who can get me staff discount at Burberry.
advice: Give yourself credit, so easy to focus on moving forward and not seeing what you've achieved.
Such an awful nights sleep 💀
Still thinking about that booty I saw on the weekend.
I adore @LykkeLi even more than I thought I could https://t.co/DxzP2MckkY
Your face when Madonna tries to kiss you with her old saggy lips https://t.co/LOW1qGGH1q
'Congratulations to the Winners
 
1st Place
 
Callum &amp; Mads - £48 big ones each'

Won the races at work! YEAH BOY
Madonna showed up at Drake's @coachella set. She really is like thrush, just can't get rid of her.
yaaaas mama https://t.co/Z4a6UXM9NR
Smashing weekend 👌
its better than 'OH MA GAHD LOOK HOW DRUNK I AM' Or 'LOOK AT MY LEGS BY THE POOL ON HOLIDAY #JEL'
I love that being fit and healthy is becoming a social media trend. I can actually deal with people posting 10k run updates
Didn't hide it very well from bae that I didn't like him going out for a drink with a girl from work 😅🔫 http://t.co/qDFXgu9q1j
Bye Felicia
🔫
Those days where you just don't get anything done
Kind of thought updating to iOS 8.3 would of fixed my smashed screen. lol.
Don't know if it's cause I'm wearing a Yeezus tour tshirt today or it's my emotions, but I want to tweet Kanye lyrics all day.
Today, all day. http://t.co/xba9F8yBFe

Can everyone stop going to the Skygarden before me
The races is like a place where only fat common birds go to socialise with other people who can't stop eating/applying tan right?
Inside I'm http://t.co/WHaK1ZuA1l
On the surface I'm http://t.co/1PrDl1U2T1
bae just suggested an open relationship. 'I'm ready if you're ready.' This is a LEGAL BINDING CONTRACT. We are now together.
Shaking my pussy to Don't Call Me Baby in the office. That will be bound to turn my bae.
kind of thinking about going vegan. lol.
Will only use black emojis from now on.
https://t.co/6dCRd7Ahtn Can't bloody wait to see @MarkusSchulz in July :D
current mood
https://t.co/bKYBEnnQyR
Every sunny day I learn that people get it very very wrong when it comes to sunglasses choices
I care about American politics more than the UK.
That shitty Protein World brand celebrities endorse has terrible packaging design. No time for that.
bae just became friends with someone from my old secondary school? http://t.co/W2nNh0UDYA
Lol at the chav in his old Golf trying to race me. You might have GTI wrote on your car but I'm still in the BMW 😂
Only a couple more weeks to go and it's Summer hours at work. Hello 12pm finish on Fridays.
Wow ITV This Morning has @PointlessBlog on to do the blind fold makeup challenge. This show just gets better and better! ...........
Literally just got the beautiful bearded French man at work to just talk to me all lunch. That accent, those muscles. I cry.
http://t.co/CMgqlbyBfL My kind of porn
Lilting. Such a powerful movie, if you have Netflix you should watch.
I'm basically Sam Smith but without the musical talent.
Someone tell me how gross my body is so I get off the sofa and go to the gym today.
Fag hags will probably be allowed in too as the gays would be powerless without them.
I'm also going to open a gay bar in MK for only gays. Discrimination at its highest. You literally will have to bottom on the door.
Back day at the gym 😫😫😫
A guy was literally parked outside Revs MK in his rented McClaren car revving his engine! This ain't Sloane street in June!
I seriously can't take living here anymore. My soul is aching for educated and cultured people who know interesting exciting things!
Milton Keynes is the most uncultured place in the entire world. It should be bombed and started over again.
'Mum hurry the fuck up with lunch I wanna take a cute Instagram before the light changes!'
Every time I bloody come home I have to bea apple genius. I seriously need to get paid.
If I can't get beautiful people's attention on Instagram, well I'll just add them on LinkedIn instead 😂 #obsessed http://t.co/OKswdksapF
Can the New York City snapchat please piss off. I already have daily heartache for not living there, why do I want to see these people.
The people getting ready to go see @aboveandbeyond at Brixton tonight are probably the luckies people in the world right now. Sigh
If people are that determined to prove their wealth or success they probably have neither
When people on Insta/facebook post pictures of their parents BMW/Audi/Merc and try make it seem like it's theirs 😂😂😂😂😂
Finding out characters from Blue is the Warmest Colour are dating in real life has got me all 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
So thankful I saw Blue is the Warmest Colour advertised when I was in New York last. Finally watched it, absolutely adored it.
legs like jelly.
People who smoke are literally so gross I have no words.
5k done 💦
Will the gym be super busy or super quiet on good friday. That is the question.
'Norman Reedus was living up to is Walking Dead reputation by taking a walk in Manhattan on Wednesday.' Wow Daily Mail. Wow.
Its highly depressing that we live in a time still where I get asked (by outside brands) to select only white models for photoshoots.

When people ask you for a 'HD JPG' It's like, gurl is this some new format I ain't heard about?
Remembered I told my bae he had too much to drink last night when he was checking out girls in front of me. #WontStandForThat
http://t.co/X5qyZ9S9jo My bank account is crying.
Fake Friday 🙌
Snapchats are for stories. So many of my contacts seem to forget that.
Out for dinner with bae. Getting serious.
The Prodigy are terrible. There I said it. Soz.
Hilarious that @GovPenceIN is trying to sugarcoat and get out easy with this bill. Lol if you attack the gays, we will fight til the end.
Brands saying 'Have you been fooled today?' No, no I haven't. I'm not a cretin.
Life would be so much easier if I had a home gym 😭💤
Tidal is a pile of absolute shit. Supported and owned by the ultra rich, to make them even richer. Who ever invests in that idea is DAF
Why do news websites ask you to subscribe or log in to 'read the full article' Nah m8, I ain't going to do that.
Being single sucks when you don't have any plans for Easter weekend. FML
Please @wearegalantis come to the UK. I will cry and dance during the whole set, I promise &lt;3
Just woke up from a dream where I won an Oscar. Thanks @Gingemeister for coming with me even though you said you haven't watched the movie
http://t.co/aukbqtlmo6

Daily Mail picture of the day.
more tickets are out for @aboveandbeyond Brixton show next weekend. FUKKKKKKKKKKKK
Seriously @DashBerlin remix of that pile of crap @MartinGarrix produced is so so good.
Guys don't get the Cucumber Seltzer drink from Pret. It ain't good. Stick to Yoga Bunny.
The cameras can't handle @ericprydz lasers 😂😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍@ultra #ULTRALIVE
Staying up for @ericprydz obviously 🙈 @ultra #ULTRALIVE
Will probably have to get a ticket to shitty EDC in MK this year due to how good @MarkusSchulz was right there #ULTRALIVE @ultra
Wow, @MarkusSchulz blowing up the Mega Structure @ultra #ULTRALIVE
How can @Skrillex @diplo think it's a good idea to bring @justinbieber out at @ultra I can't get my head around it.
Robin Schulz is doing a great set, but can't help thinking it doesn't work on the main stage? @ultra #ULTRALIVE
The weather in Miami looks glorious ☀️☀️☀️☀️😎@ultra #ULTRALIVE
It's so light for 6.30. I'm so confused 🕢
Could @ultra announce the live stream line up for today please so I can plan when do go to the gym... THANKS
Last night @Axwell @Ingrosso made up for how shit they were in Swedish House Mafia. Bravo. @ultra #ULTRALIVE
If Justin Beiber performs at Ultra tonight with Jack U, I will literally end my relationship with dance music. @ultra #ULTRALIVE
http://t.co/ZwLZyxoqqO

Tamara has all the money in the world, and she chooses to rock New Era 9Forty on her head.
LOL @Usher lip syncing on @MartinGarrix performance. So shockingly terrible. #ULTRALIVE
On sundays I wake up wishing I still live in Bristol where you can get seriously good breakfasts.
Wow didn't think Avicii or Martin Garrix could get any worse. Then they collab. So so bad.
If/when I'm a massive DJ playing at @ultra I will never have a live singer come out and sing over a track. It never sounds good. #ULTRALIVE
oh lord @feddelegrand is so hot #ULTRALIVE @ultra
In love with @wearegalantis even more from watching their #ULTRALIVE performance. So refreshing to dance music.
&lt;3 @wearegalantis should be headlining main stage.  #ULTRALIVE
Been invited to witness a ceremony by city of London at the Guild Hall next month. 😍😍😍😍😍
Already searching for IDs and ice recordings and it's only one day in 😂 #ULTRALIVE @ultra
#ULTRALIVE on Snapchat 🙏
Dash Berlin just officially opened Ultra mainstage with that set #UMF2015 #ULTRALIVE @DashBerlin
dont be that douche that hears 'a cool new dance song on the radio' 10 years late, watch this all weekend http://t.co/8uqx6z1G2R #educate
Only a few hours until this stage comes alive 😍😍😍😍 #UMFTV @ultra http://t.co/z9pHyDDqUk
Going to Paris baby
Only a couple more hours left in this year long wait. @ultra music festival live stream begins tonight. So much music to be discovered.
Work bae just asked me if he could get a sleeve tattoo. I said how would he look in his wedding dress on our wedding day?
New Era's big boss said I looked like James Dean today. I'm guessng he meant the film star, not @JamesDeen
Just Googled 'Can you die from being too tired'
If I close my eyes and turn the heating up in the office with my tunes on loud it almost feels like I'm in Miami? #Ultra2015 @ultra #WMC15
Just this day to get through and I can sleep
