At that point. I was terrified. Then all I had was constant threats &amp; abuse when I was sticking up for myself. I was nothing to them at all
I was always the black sheep anyway. Its always been the same. was used for money the first year I came home 2005. They new I was vulnerable
People tell me not to get angry but what do you do when no one even bothers with you and its always you making the contact with them. :-/
