Just entered the give away for orchard corset. I hope I win! Keeping my fingers crossed!! #orchardcorset #pinuppersuasion
A day of retail therapy makes everything better at least for this redhead it does ðŸ˜€
I kissed a stripper and I liked it,
the taste of her glitter lipstick.
I kissed her just to do it,
Of course my boyfriend didn't mind it.
I'm guilty of dressing sexier and spending more time getting ready to go to the strip club than for a date. Priorities Baby Priorities!
Getting a boob compliment from strippers is like the "Holy Grail" of compliments #StripperComplimentsRock
Random photo time! http://t.co/Bazy0YYDNa
Sexting guys vs girls:

Guys: I want to fuck you hard
Girls: I want to kiss every inch of you and feel you quivering beneath my tongue
Does showing my cleavage work the same on women as it does men?
So a cute girl just asked me on a date..now I just need to ask the boyfriend if I can go lol. #BisexualGirlProblems
Sexting girls is so much more fun than sexting boys lol.
So a cute girl just volunteered to be my new hobby! Yes please!
Spending the day perving beautiful women online :)
New phone + new number = no ex drama ðŸ˜€

Spiders...making girls scream louder than their boyfriends ever could in the bedroom!!!
Two bottles of wine demolished last night and another two bottles chilling for tonight :)
The beginning of a good night :) http://t.co/FmdfzIC4mh
Handcuffs, corsets, and wine...the mischief that I get into after just a few hours with the bestie...
Perving pictures of my favorite stripper with the bestie :)
Hurray for shocking people on the train!
The look on the little old man's face when I told him I enjoy going to the strip club more than my male counterpart...priceless!
My response when asked to clean the kitchen...

"The sex is free...cleaning costs extra."
