Man is the goat but he spouts some pish

Need to beat Chelsea at the ems &amp; hope United and Liverpool do us a favour to have any chance of the league

Tiger to play the masters? It just went from unmissable to unmissable
Bier Halle &amp; Hummingbird with the strathclyders 🍺
good content
"my sweet lord" was playing while I was in the dentists and that has literally ruined george harrison for me forever
spectre teaser trailer was #deec
should be good
genuinely thrilled that I have some Ainsley Harriot instant Cous Cous in my cupboard. What the fuck have I become.
How is Jimmy Walker only 10th in the world? 5 wins in 18 months...
Toni Kroos has been awful
banter from scotland
Katie Hopkins would leave the UK if Labour won? Surely that's game over
Miliband definitely won that. Cameron relayed scripted answers and Ed dealt with a 15 minute attack on his character.
Can't agree more with Ed Milibands words on the Iraq war and Syria
Laugh at Ed Miliband all you like but the man is right. The country is too unequal. Who's going to change that? Not the Tories, not UKIP...
oh god ed. be more specific please
DONT MENTION THE BACON SANDWICH ED
fuck off the questions to miliband are definately harder than camerons, such a conspiracy
Labour aren't socialist enough #redsammy
ed is gonna totally crash and burn.
Paxman going ham
Sanchez bossing piano too. What a man
arsenal summer transfer policy: sign as many germans as possible
