Going to Vegas in June for the hockey awards and a separate celebration.  DM me if you'd going to go.  Love to meet all of you.
Great job @Power106LA
Happy Stanley Cup Playoffs day. May the best team win.
I feel more connected to people on twitter than friends on Facebook. ..
Reopened my Facebook temporary.  Funny how everyone "missed" me.  I'll have it back open soon and will post it on here.Once I clean house; )
I had tears coming down :/ https://t.co/GCXgJwvsFq
Thanks @Power106LA you're making me feel a lot better tonight
I'm probably going to have to stay more year in Colorado. :/ need to get season tickets for the AVS then. I'll be back soon #SoCal
At 20K I will be giving away a signed Gorges pic when he was with the Canadians. Also,  a signed puck from an AVS player as a thanks.
At 20K tweets I want to give a special tribute to my friends on twitter.
I cried last year because I watched my idol @TeemuSel8nne play his last game. My next tears are for the Stanley Cup @AnaheimDucks
Don't step in the D https://t.co/SbjrS95zRw
