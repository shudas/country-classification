Now a walk at the forks
Had a car cleaning day!!
It's been approximately six weeks, only got one interview. I need to up my game.
Even more unhappy with the schedule.  Not only is it not open shifts it's now at both locations.
10 hour sleep,  hell yaa
Gotta be very very tight with my money spendings
New start,  yupp 👌
Lol my bad forgot the important part in boosting a car turning it on #fail #toofunny
Craving an icecap,  only a few more minutes eeeep
Job applying tomorrow and the following days, cross fingers one calls me back
Confused on what to think
Seemed like such a long shift!
Damn forgot to turn my lights off last night,  need a boost now lol
Cruising with my babes 🚗
At vodka rocks with Kristen and Sara :):)
Or for lunch tomorrow!
Now I have a whole burger and fries and buns for a midnight snack :D
Loveee the onion loaf at Tony Roma's I should ask next time if you can only get a baked potato on the side I only wanted the load and potato
Wearing heels tonight whuu long time
Feeling special and accomplished...  Got my diplomas!!!!  #graduate #college #legslassistant #winnipeg
Focus on the positives #advice
Getting my diplomas tomorrow :):):):):)
I hate looking forward to things then building up excitement just to be disappointed in the end #awful #feeling
If we would of been three rows down would of been a fantastic concert, great music, awful experience #EricChurch #winnipeg #mtscentre
Would of been an awesome concert if people would of sat down infront didn't enjoy myself #EricChurch #winnipeg #mtscentre #disappointed
1130-730, what a stupid shift. Wheres my usual 9-5?
Changes the schedule after a week of it already being out.. How stupid,  people makes pla s after finding out their schedule #notimpressed
Yay my diplomas are ready for pickup!!!
Eric Church tonight!!!!  😊😊😊 #winnipeg #mtscenter
How to take things slow..
Going out for breakfast this morning 😃
Workie time soon,  four hour shift lol
Again your car is more important to you than me
If we had discussed it you would of known  I didn't know what I could make for such a large amount of people so I don't feel like cooking
Lying when angry or frustrated doesn't make it allowed you shouldn't lie about something in the first place
Saying I don't know whatever you want to doesn't help with planning what to do
Answers of I don't know does not solve anything
Wow just noticed I made a selling error on my sign #fail  why didn't anyone tell me!!
Really hoping I get a call back this week from the interview I had last week
Easter eggs was a bust...  Simple conversation couldn't even be done.. Just a laugh not being ignored.. Simple solution
Looked neat with all the vehicles following behind tonight
Start our own traditions #future #life #changes #personal #choices
26 vehicles 🚗 🚗
You tell me you have a surprise for me and that I will really like it... I have one guess eeeeeppppp can't wait :):):):):):)
