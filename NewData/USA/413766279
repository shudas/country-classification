PG FROM DEEP!! @INPacerNation #PacersNation
If the Celtics and Heat lose today and The @Pacers beat the Heat tomorrow night, we're back in 8th place. @INPacerNation #PacerNation
Tough end to the half but really it could be worse. #PacerNation @INPacerNation
Biggest week of the season for the @Pacers. They play the 4 closest teams in the standings. #PacerNation @INPacerNation

How is Harden earning a living with all this money he's dishing out to the refs?? @INPacerNation #PacersNation
Enjoying Puerto Vallarta, but excited to get back and check out envoyer. Of course it drops while I'm on vacation.. @laravelphp
Brought up a new @linode server with Laravel's Forge. A couple hiccups but overall really easy thanks to @laracasts.
If we could not lose to the Knicks that'd be grrreeaaatttt. #PacerNation
Missed the first half of the @Pacers game. Apparently so did the @nyknicks. @INPacerNation #PacerNation
I laughed more during the @CommunityTV trailer than I do during entire seasons of most comedy shows. Can. Not. Wait.
I've never watched The Bachelor, but everything @AnnaKendrick47 said last night is absolutely true. #CelebGospel #BookOfKendrick
2/3 just like @INPacerNation said with the '76ers on the backside and the 7th seed to catch. Lost season my ass. #PacerNation
