Its pitch black and the street lights are still on, this means I should still be in bed and not going to work
Putting me in such a bad mood knowing that I now have to go to work in an hour
It's soooo cold
This weather does not motivate me to work outside for 7 hours
Desperately needing my bed
Far to sleepy for school
All I do when I come home from school is eat
Not looking forward to this 10 hour shift at all
Do not want to get put off bed. Fu school
