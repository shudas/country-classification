Feelings aren't that scary, people. Labelling them is good!
I overthink way too often baha https://t.co/VHdNzCO2n7
So extremely true. I do. https://t.co/OXhwLge3j4
Feeling unconditional love is a pretty amazing experience. Didn't ask for it and don't know what will come of it, but it's great!!
Off to the physio... Yay! And not just excited coz my my physio is hella cute... :p
I fucking knew it! https://t.co/4Rexe0VNO0
Feeling refreshed after a run. But seriously I have #onethingonmymind ... Patience is not a forte of mine!
#GoodMorning! Time to go for a #run - first time in over a week...
Time for bed! #goodnight #isleepnaked #wishyouwerehere

I should go home and study: So behind. But I'm so exhausted, not sure I'll be able to concentrate. Maybe I should start tomorrow with a run?
So very true. Love can be both scary and exhilarating at the same time. https://t.co/xai3Wqp9wK
You can't choose when you fall in love, or with whom. Learning to just enjoy what we've got and have faith it will all work out for the best
I miss you. That is all.
Woke up from an amazing dream... Which was actually a memory! Great way to start Sunday.
Time for bed after a pretty damn amazing day. Life may not be perfect, but there's many perfect moments currently... So good. Love y'all x
Feeling far more at ease. He's right... I really do need to stop overthinking.
So nervous, considering cancelling.
Off to bed! I'm old and need my beauty sleep before brunch with the sexiest guy alive tomorrow morning! Night all!
So incredibly nervous. Things have just felt weird lately. Hope it's ok.
Grow. The. Fuck. Up.
Feeling really unusual and weird. Not the best feeling in the world
