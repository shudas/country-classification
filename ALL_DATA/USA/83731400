There's a @Sonos war happening in my house right now!
Just listened to two old women discuss how you pronounce "gyro"
Had coffee too late last night, couldn't sleep, organized my bathroom. Felt like Monica from Friends.
DAMN IT!  // @Janglim21

Drank wine. Got sleepy. Ate ice cream, now I'm awake.
I'm currently in a customer service chat room on a shoe website. What is my life. #shoequestions #SteveMadden
Wine is good. So is pizza.
Goodmorning! Just a friendly reminder: don't drink orange juice immediately after brushing your… https://t.co/HPlQIquQO2
I feel like "uptown funk" is a weird song to listen to alone, but I'm doing it anyways. #solojammmin
Thanks for the sleepy mask, @lenalandgraf . Love ya. Miss ya, chick! http://t.co/p8xk8Ub7JZ
I just applied tea tree oil all over my face, and my dad walks by and says "does something smell like bug spray to you?" #awesome
These sunglasses may be the best, worst judgement purchase I've ever made. http://t.co/yLIQzhXDih
Ben&amp;jerrys is the first autocorrect that comes up when I type "being." it would seem that my love for ice cream surpasses all basic grammar.
Being sick means too much free time which means too much time online shopping which means impulse buys.

I'd definitely play baseball if we got to wear the uniforms they wear in "a league of their own." #hellyeahdressses http://t.co/kJWse7OdyQ
Remember when @typennington used to make every american family with basic cable cry every Sunday night? #extremehomemakeover
Oiiii. I'm an embarrassing sick person. I have a bandaid on my toe too. Unrelated, but still. #razorhackjob
You know you have a fever when @AlaskanBushPPL makes you get all choked up. #happybirthdaysnowbird
Still dreaming of my breakfast from Saturday. Shoutout to @vovomeena on the bloggie blog. //  http://t.co/SWYixnSh1X
My sister came over this morning, woke me up and made me coffee. Nothing better than having your sister as a bff. 👯☕️☺️
So excited to be able to celebrate today with so much of God's family🙌💚 #ccveaster #ccvonline http://t.co/qrVQ0DTHA2
I just went through the @innoutburger_ drive through wearing sweats. This feels like an all time low. Lol.
Me and this lovely lady went on a bff brunch date today. We drank a lot of coffee, and listened to a… https://t.co/0DG0Dsn6hK
How embarrassing is it if I don't change it? 😏 http://t.co/Kt34Kf6FUg
I just ordered teriyaki chicken at a sushi restaurant and she asked "you want white meat don't you?" She totally just profiled me.
I just got a text from my mom with this emoji: 🍷 and that's it. I like her. I'm also listening to nirvana which is weird for me.
Hair play! http://t.co/iuKew71w4G
Doing my taxes and they've reminded me that I'm single like 20 times already. Thanks for reminding me, turbotax. 😒

The guy who decided it was a good idea to cut the middle of the donut out is the worst. Why would you take away one last bite of goodness?
I've been watching @AlaskanBushPPL with my dad a lot lately. I feel like that's the kind of show you only watch with your dad.
Remember that one time the whole world was freaking out about a dress? Me too.
"Id love to have a strictly platonic relationship with Bruno Mars." -said nobody ever.
I just followed a playlist on @Spotify called "white girl party playlist." And I'm not even embarrassed about it👊
To all 8 of my periscope followers. Sorry for any notifications you got from me. I'm bad at that app. 👎
Listened through Montevallo already 3 times today💪 // @SamHuntMusic
When your sister is the only one who joins your @periscopeco live stream😐
Both of my parents have asked me for advice on their outfits this morning atleast 2 times each. #conversedilemmas #dressdilemmas
During the sandal naming process, somebody suggested "flip flops" + nobody wanted to hurt their feelings, so they just went with it.
"Throw away that chair!" They said. "No!" I said. http://t.co/FHAKUISaW1
Shoutout to all the fellas over there with the hella good hair.! #TaylorSwift @taylorswift13
The answer is: yes. Going on 5 days strong💪 hairspray still smells awesome. Thanks @BedHeadStyling
Debating whether or not I can go another day without washing my hair..
My house is being overtaken by fruit flies and they are slowly stealing my sanity. It would seem im subject to a freakout at any moment now.
Thoroughly enjoyed that. #BieberRoast
Ok. Martha was pretty good. I'm impressed. @MarthaStewart #BieberRoast
My brain is having the hardest time accepting the size difference of @SHAQ &amp; @KevinHart4real #dontstandnexttoeachotherplz
But...why...Martha..Stewart? If I was the roastee, I'd be pretty upset about this panel of peeps. #BieberRoast
Eating tortilla chips like they're going out of style✌️

Waking up to the sound of a crazy dog barking in your living room is a sure way to piss you off.
Your vibes too much.
If you got a dollar every time I said "that's so cute" while in target- you'd have a lot of money.

I declare today and everyday @SamHuntMusic appreciation day. 👍 #thatface
I sat at a community table today. I was trapped in the weirdest conversation ever for 30 minutes. Won't do that again.
Congrats guys, it's almost Friday. I'm ending today with wine and cheese. ✌️💚 https://t.co/zuuNochYKB
My loofah just totally fell apart. I'm way more upset about this than I should be. 😩😭 @bathbodyworks HELP! http://t.co/uKraWHjJhN

Today I bought a ringtone of the Main Street music at disneyland. I'm having major issues.
Boom. Roasted.
I want to go to a dessert buffet. With every single dessert known to man!
Got to @HobbyLobby, then I realized it was Sunday😩
I really like hard cider. I'm super happy it's a thing🍎🍏

I think starbucks is trying to freeze me out!
That moment when you realize that your emoji usage might be a little excessive...
I'm good at car flirting, just not regular flirting. #struggles
Brains do weirder things at night.
After a long day of travel, a cup of tea and a pb&amp;j is definitely in order!
HOME! Airport, I don't want to see you for awhile.
I strongly believe airports should only play sitcoms, instead of the news. No one can be in a bad mood while Friends is on!

Eating at a breakfast diner in Iowa, and a fellow customer refilled everyone's coffee at our table. I'm not used to this small town stuff!
