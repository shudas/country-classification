People debating whether to boycott Spurs or not, loool I'm debating whether I'll even watch it on TV

4-3-3, high energy attacking football, pacey wingers, engines in midfield, poacher - I got this #Tactics
My heart sank when everyone bucked me on it in ICT wallahi
When in actual fact it was Congo..
I remember when someone updated wikipedia saying Somalia won the 1968 AFCON and I went round the whole of Poly convincing everyone we did
Maybe I should make history and start up the national team ðŸ‘€. #AbdiIn
HOW CAN ETHIOPIA HAVE A TEAM AND WE DON'T
How can Virgin Islands have a team and we don't..
How can Kenya have a team and we don't..
Do you know how much it depresses me that Somalia don't have a football team
