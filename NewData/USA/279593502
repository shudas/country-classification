Stacy's mom has got it going on
Told my mom that the bread she got had mold on it, she didn't believe me until I sent her this http://t.co/C2MoH3FLYg
Never realized how useless having parents as teachers are bc my mom never helps me
Also annoyed that my mom doesn't even care that I can't do my hw bc she fucking breaks all the stuff in this house
