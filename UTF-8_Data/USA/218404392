It is a blessing to be a blessing. We don't ever do what we do for recognition, bettering the community as a whole is the mission......
Some of our volunteers are dealing with their own problems, but refuse to allow that to stop them from making a positive impact on another..
What separates us from other groups, aside from our overall mission, consistency, &amp; proactivity, is the genuineness of every1 involved....
It is a blessing to have such dedicated and compassionate individuals onboard.....
I cannot take credit though. Our volunteers are the fuel of our organization. Without them, the impact we make would be minimal.....
A lot of people have been telling me "Great Job" and patting me on the back, in regards to the work We do at @teamWhoIAm.....
Do all you can for everyone who deserves your help.....
No matter where you go, when you go into a place it should Never be the same when you leave, Presence is everything.....
Be Humble, be Grateful and be Careful; but most importantly don't forget to be Great.....

Take a chance with a clear mind....
Humble beginnings are True beginnings and Progress is a Process....
You're never too young to be a mentor. You're never too old to have one….
Every flower must grow through dirt.....
Sometimes the best thing you can do for someone who is unwilling to work on themselves is to give them space to grow.....
You either hate change enough to accept mediocrity, or you hate mediocrity enough to change.....
Don't wait until something no longer requires your attention to then make the effort.....
Best part of living in a new city/state is being able to go anywhere without running into someone who knows you....

Without the little voice in your head, would you be able to read this?
I have almost 10 years of retail under my belt. I #Salute anyone and everyone who works retail. Especially during the holidays....
Working in retail is not easy as some may think, but it toughens you up and teaches you a lot about people and life in general.....

Find a way to be inspired before you are expired. Life is short, so maximize your moments…..
Can't possibly live life not wanting to be great at something. It's human nature. It's just how much you're willing to give....
Nothing is predestined: The obstacles of your past can become the gateways that lead to new beginnings.....
Never look to someone for help before you look within yourself....

There is no education like adversity.....
Life is simple, we just complicate it.....

Don't get sidetracked by those who aren't even on track....
Sometimes, two people have to fall apart to realize how much they need to fall back together….
Don't let the imaginary person in your head keep you from loving the REAL one right in front of you.....
If someone isn't trying their best for you, they probably aren't the best for you.....
Choose who and what you want in a relationship rather than just making it work with whoever chooses you.....
If u don't control your attitude, then it will control u. When u have control over your thoughts, u will have control over your life.....
No relationship is ever a waste of time. If it didn't bring you what you want, it taught you what you don't want.....
You can't move forward with backwards thinking.....

Sometimes you need that honest voice, even if it’s not what you want to hear…..
When your friends aren’t going to tell you what you did wrong, they will....
They will be there when everything else gets cloudy/confusing and you have a hard time keeping your mind set on what’s actually important...
They will always be there to remind you that you could be better, you could do better.....
Sometimes you need those people telling you what you’re doing wrong or why you’re not “the sh*t”, so you don’t get a big head.....
Success can get to your head more quickly than you think. “Haters” have the ability to keep things in perspective....
They will be there when you forget what you’re fighting for. Use them as a constant reminder of your goals.....
They will always be there on the sidelines, cheering you towards failure, reminding you of what you have to do to prove them wrong.....
If you have a group of people waiting for your demise, you are only going to work that much harder.....
When you have no fire under your butt, you’re not going to run as fast.....
By no means should you be pursuing a goal due to the whims of others, but you should use them as another motivating factor.....
Sometimes you need that outside force telling you that you’re not good enough.....
For all you know, you may need those “haters” to keep you going, they could be your fuel. You can only push yourself so much.....
“Haters” are necessary to your achievement. We need that voice in our heads, pushing us when we want to give up.....
To blame anyone else for your failures but yourself, is both naive and blind.....
My life has changed by changing lives.....
Too many people do things solely for spikes in "likes".....#DontBeDoinThat

Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it….
Efficiency is doing things right, while effectiveness is doing the right things.....
Knowledge is only powerful when it is put into action.....
A lot of people just hate seeing other people doing better than them.....#ThatsJustLife
Say what you mean, and mean what you say.....
Good things happen to those who legitimately hustle.....
The challenge with life is realizing that you've been through what you've been through for a reason.....
It's completely okay to live a life that nobody understands. It isn't their life to understand.....

Of course I had to move next door to two dogs who only decide to bark at night, all night.....
Life is like walking a tightrope; the higher you go, the more balance you need.....
Let the past go. Your past has passed. Life is too short to drown in the water under the bridge.....
Your priorities make you a minority, not your ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual preferences......
Knowing where you came from should keep you from being arrogant. What makes you stand out is what you stand for.....
Knowing who you are will make you confident. Never allow where you grew up to keep you from growing up.....
It matters what you build on. Consistency is the key to any worthwhile breakthrough. You reap what you repeat.....
Storms come to show you what you're made of. Are you building a sand castle or a brick house?
Don't be afraid to lose things. The fastest way to reach your destination may be to travel light....
Why don't u have eyes in the back of ur head? Because your best days are not behind u, they're in front of u. Keep them on the horizon.....
There are three kinds of people in your life; builders, bridges, and bystanders. Knowing the difference can save you a lot of heartache.....
Stop acting like an elevator; if people push the right buttons they take you up or pull you down.....
You can't have more until you're willing to be more.....

There are still many good (wo)men in the world. Many times, we overlook them simply because they don't appear like we want them to.....
A woman's thoughts and goals are like the pages of a good book; the more I read, the more I'm interested.....
Learn the difference between someone who really wants you, and someone who just doesn't know how to be alone.....

All u should focus on is doing the best u can with what u have. The rest will fall into place, as long as defeat isn't visible on ur face...
You can't reach the finish line if you don't start moving towards it.....
Don't worry about what you lack, allow what you possess to pick up the slack.....
Slow progress is always better than no progress.....
I'd rather have 4 quarters than 100 pennies; pertaining to friends. Too much change makes too much noise and gets heavy in the pockets.....
My life improved significantly when I started caring more about the quality of friends I have, rather than the quantity......
It's truly refreshing to completely detach yourself from people who solely feed off of your misery.....
I may have stopped contacting some people on a daily basis, but hopefully they know I'm here for them regardless of the circumstance.....
When someone makes an effort to avoid or not communicate, it should tell you they don't care. Those who care will find a way to connect.....
To everyone following their dreams:
Stay positive, keep your eyes on the horizon, and like a car with no brakes; don't stop.....
