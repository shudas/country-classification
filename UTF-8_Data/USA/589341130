Vona Logan and I are one chapter away from finishing this 90k novel! It could have been done last night but I called it quits at 3am.

3 new houses looked at, none were any good. Sigh. This is frustrating.
If the house we're looking at today works out we'll be a block away from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal which has bison http://t.co/UOUINdDlNQ
I'll be at Starfest this weekend and my suitcase full of books is nearly done. Need to order 5 more today and hope they get here by Friday.
Looking at more houses today. I'm hoping one of them works out.
New cover art to share :). The sequel to Rescuing Jack. Dreamspinner Press, Werewolves, Asexual Romance. http://t.co/KRkM4wxT08

Co-Author problems: When the only characters that are screaming in your mind are co-written ones, and your co is sick and needs a break.
Pretty sure my mom is going to miss my dog more than me when we move.
The housing market is stupid crazy here in Denver. Put a bid on a house Sunday, found out there are 27 offers yesterday, will know today.
Stories I've worked on so far this morning: YA Lesbian Cyberpunk, Gay 1800's Western Historical, and Gay Sci Fi. I love being an author.
My one, and very much only, historical has been through re-writes. Historicals are hard. Props to those who can do them all the time.
There's a chocolate festival coming to Denver. Groupon has a coupon. Chocolate... Nom nom nom. As if I need any more of it in me.
It's silly, but after writing a historical I know my characters are now dead. Which is sad. Contemp, para, fantasy- they're alive somewhere.
All these reptiles that I really want are suddenly becoming available but I've been forbidden to bring anything new home until we move. Argh
Doing re-writes of a short historical today. At least it's only 15,000 words.

If this house falls through we're going to reconsider Deer Trail. It's a far drive but it's either that or major compromises. Stupid market.
Trying to focus on writing today and it's just not happening.  Cleaning, packing, and organizing instead.
Purging things in preparation for a move is kind of fun. I have boxes of stuff I haven't thought about in 5 yrs and it's all being donated.
Will know by 5 today if our offer over the asking price of the house was enough to get it. This market is crazy. People are going 30k over.

Needing to step away from my non-author facebook for a few days. My SIL feels no responsibility when it comes to what happened with her dogs
If all goes well and no one makes me cry again we will close on the house may 15th and then the weekend after that is the Denver comiccon.
YA lesbian cyberpunk written with Jess Roth just crossed the 2k mark. Aw. I love when stories are in their baby phase.
My SIL moved somewhere that didn't allow dogs and took her two pits. The dogs were forced to go. Of course my SIL takes no responsibility.
GoT!
Now I wait 27 hours to find out if the offer on the house was accepted. Looking at furniture to distract myself.
Loved one of the 12 houses. Made an offer.

We're looking at 12 new houses tomorrow. I'm hoping to fall in love again.
I love how "completely not updated in 50 years kitchen" is now called a "period kitchen" in real estate.
House fell through.  The search continues!
The second novel in the series with vona Logan just hit 80k :).  Woohoo! Home stretch time!

I'm slightly confused (and highly impatient) as to why it'll take 5 weeks to close when everything is being done next week.

Okay. Panic mode. Does anyone else have google drive? I have someone visible on a doc that doesn't have access and the link sharing is off.
Our offer on the awesome house got accepted! Now for the financing, inspection, and appraisal. One step closer to owning this house!
Worrying about whether or not our offer on the home will be accepted is messing with my 5k words a day minimum. I just want to know!

Putting in an offer here. So in love. http://t.co/f2yqizTDuh
This house we're looking at today has a really pretty green bedroom I'd like to keep my reptiles in. Need to calm down and not fall in love.
Going to look at a bright blue house today. If we get it then telling people where we live will be easy. I really like the inside of it.

Oh cripes. Just put an offer in for the house. Please current owners accept. Please accept. This will be our first house.
WE'RE PUTTING IN AN OFFER ON A HOUSE IN THORNTON!
I'm looking into fostering &amp; this broke me "feels protective of his siblings &amp; wants a loving family for all of them "…who will not yell". "
One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to when we move: The 2 cages that need 130 hot spots will no longer be overheating my bedroom
House hunting is hard. I think I'll have a chocolate-banana-pb smoothie and call it for today. I'm supposed to be at 12k for this novel Nope
Rescuing Jack in paperback is only $7.50 right now with Dreamspinner's sale. Stock up on your favorites! http://t.co/hpA1VnIYQZ
http://t.co/cU5yfJHbJE aw. Mama eagle is feeding the baby eagles. My word count is going to suck today thanks to this little family.
The baby Bald Eagles are visible! http://t.co/cU5yfJHbJE

Someday I will write a bird shifter series.

Denver housing market, why must this be so hard? Now I'm considering a two hour round trip commute and wondering how much that would suck.
Well sh*t. House I really wanted to look at tomorrow is an ex meth house. No way in hell I'm stepping foot in there.
I promised my mom she could read Weathering the Storm. It'll be the first thing she's read of mine. Gotta get up the guts to hand it over.

Harper Collins author just assumed I'm unpublished because I write lgbtq romance. Uh nope but nice try. Ugh.
Tip for new authors of lgbtq fiction- don't get discouraged by what high selling big 6 authors make. Our niche is smaller but still great.
This conference I'm at right now is probably the only time in my life that I will see gay erotica romance next to children's books.
Hunting a Lady, a lesbian fantasy short story Cari Z and I wrote together, is a bestseller on All Romance Ebooks :) https://t.co/jnqstsqrMH

Dilemmas. Not sure which novel to do this month. Sci Fi Prostitutes book 2, or contemporary small town book 3? Both sexy gay romances. Hmmm.
Snow on the ground, which means jeans instead of a skirt. But jeans remind me that cheesecake isn't good for hips. Ugh. Sweats instead then.
Writing meeting today with some people from @OutInColorado1 should be fun. Getting together usually is.
Going house shopping tonight. Going to have my own writing space. Going to have a bookshelf. Going to have people over for writing and beer.

RV idea isn't fair to the girls, so now we're looking at buying a house. It's terrifying.
Snow in April :)

If we really do end up buying an RV I'm going to have to get rid of so many hundreds of pounds of stuff. Boxes everywhere of just stuff.
I'm selling my wedding dress. My dad will be gone a year on June 6th &amp; no point in having a party when we're married and he's not there.
Not a mobile home, an RV. I keep getting them mixed up. Lots of traveling in my future.
Us living in a mobile home could be a reality as early as July!
