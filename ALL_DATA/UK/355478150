Makes no sense. Am baffled. Garn to bed. United.
'Can't fault the effort' but the lack of effort resulted in Sterling putting the ball on his L foot, what they 'talked about' beforehand.
140 characters for how annoyed i am just isn't enough.
Who doesn't even want to play for us. WHERE THE FUCK IS THE LOGIC IN THAT. (2/2)
Sorry but you've got Jack Colback, a local player, who gives 90 if not 100% every game, and you give the captaincy to a French fuck (1/2)
What a disgusting fucking embarrassment. If he never pulls on the shirt again I couldn't care less.
If Carver's going to defend the bone idol bastard for wearing the armband I wish he'd act like a fucking captain. Irate, overrated wanker.
I'll actually pay Mike Williamson's metro fare to Gateshead Stadium.

Nice gesture from the Liverpool fans that.

Hate it when you take a tablet and it feels like it's stuck in your throat.
Defoe will never hit a ball like that in his career ever again.
