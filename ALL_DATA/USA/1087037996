Also, Audwin comes to every one of my races dressed in a business suit, jacket and all. Everyone else's parents come in sweats... not Audwin
Audwin enjoys dogs, fine clothing, star trek, and martial arts movies where the words don't match their mouths.
Audwin has a Bose sound system in his sports car &amp; listens to nothing but Bach &amp; cello music on CD's. He has an aux but refuses to use it.

REFS GOT STRIPES ON BUT LOWKEY GOT DUKE JERSEYS UNDER THEIR UNIFORMS
Grayson Allen looks like he's 6 years old and just got told he couldn't have a cookie out of the cookie jar

however, Duke has a bench of players not afraid to attack the rim at every chance they get
Kaminsky is 7'0, plays center on defense, plays forward on offense, and can dribble. that makes him an EXTREMELY versatile player
