I also just got tickets to see The Smith Street Band play in Melbourne. Today is a good day.
My sisters getting married today. How fucking crazy is that.
'I already miss your nose'
No word of a lie, I swear, every tattoo studio Ive been into has somehow had some relation to Queens of the Stone Age. This is no exception.
Taking your friends little sister to get her first tattoo because her mum trusts you more than her other daughter 😂
Ah yes, the inevitable.
He doesn't want a relationship.
I don't want a relationship with him.
But regular cuddles goodnight texts are always good.
This terrible solo decision just calmed down. And it's only the previews. Winner 👌. http://t.co/AxEr0ppXjh
'On Taco Tuesday I'm going to kraglize the entire universe, so that everyone will stop messing with my stuff!'

'We should go avocado picking'

I just want Ali cuddles. Ugh. I'm such a soppy little bitch.
Me : damn, I really need to start saving.

Me : woops. http://t.co/Xf818w9dvb

The Chloe withdrawals are real.

First night since I went away that I've been back in my own bed by myself. Do not rate. Not sleeping alone is too great. 😔
Last night was super lovely. And he was super lovely. Both of us having to get up early this morning because I had work was not.

Reiterating how great priority check in is.
My pineapple tattoo got stuck to my shirt in my sleep and I accidentally ripped it off getting up and it's been stinging since 😭😭😭
Real friendships. http://t.co/XtSVvMOhwN

Also priority boarding and the lounge with free food and satisfaction of pushing in front of the grumpy middle aged. USE YOUR POINTS PEOPLE.
Okay being able to go through priority check in at this time of the morning is so great.
Card wouldn't read and I literally missed the early train by half a minute. And the get me there on time train is running late. Wonderful.
I forgot about how good it'll be to see Shaun again when I'm home and he just messaged me and I'm that much more excited for tomorrow !
My motivation to pack for the next week is probably somewhere around -87.
All I've been craving for like the last week is hot chips drowning in gravy and melted cheese. 😩😩😩
I made hummingbird cake the other night and it was delicious. The end. https://t.co/Z0CDtyD7BA
NEW TATTOOS NEXT WEEK. NEW TATTOOS NEXT WEEK. NEW TATTOOS NEXT WEEK. YES YES YES.
Changing to loreal for my foundation was one of the best things I've done. #girllyf
Okay so maybe my birthday weekend could just be a weekend of gigs by how things are going. Even though big pine is the weekend before. 😎😎😍😍
JEBEDIAH ARE PLAYING THEIR 20th ANIIVERSARY SHOW IN SYDNEY ON MY BIRTHDAY. AT ONE OF MY FAVOURITE VENUES. THIS IS SO GREAT.
Okay my hummingbird cake was fucking delicious. But after half a piece I feel like I'm going to vomit sugar for the next three days.
MY BROTHER GOT A PUPPY TODAY AND ITS FUCKING ADORABLE. Can't wait to strangle it with my love next week
 😍😍🐶🐶😍😍 http://t.co/MSYTLJusov
Daylight savings is over soon right ? Because I'm still not okay with it being this bright at six o'clock.
THE BLACK GUY FROM HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER WAS IN HARRY POTTER. WHHHHAAAT. Mr Gibbons.
My step dad still calls me kiddo, and it's always going to be one of my favourite things in the world. 💕
Wanted : one person to act as life size hot water bottle.
Apparently there's muscles in my torso and not just space for food storage. Help.
It's crazy how quickly even a little bit of exercise can make you feel so much better.
Who do I pay to do my meal prep for me though. 
100% the worst thing ever.
Did dead lifts for the first time tonight. WHAT AN AMAZING EXERCISE.
I turn 25 next year. What fucking bullshit.
You know what would fix all my problems. 8 million dollars.
This purple is great and everything. But man, I miss being blonde so bad right now 😭😭😭
Big guns. False names. Fast cars. Ivory.
Faux pas. Cocaine. Nose jobs. Irony.

Chuck Bass withdrawals.
Imagine being the closest to loving someone you've ever been and not being able to tell them for years. Or ever.
I can't do this again.
My 2016 has already been made. 😭🙌 https://t.co/ifxf6YQfAd
#np : Milka - One Day 👌
It's getting to me more than it should that Guy Sebastian is representing Australia at Eurovision. WHAT ABOUT TISM ?!

Pretty damn fucking excited I finally get to babysit this little turd when I fly home in a couple of weeks. 😍😍 http://t.co/uGbEKoIG2R
😩😩😩😩😩😩😷
Kinda don't give a fuck if its 'too much information' for males because you don't have to deal w/ contracting uterus + insane hunger combo.
You dont know bloated til youve downed a 1/4 of a quiche, 1/2 a litre of coke and a bag of chips in one go on the first day of your period.
Finally cleaning my car out properly for the first time in, too long. Now have about twenty bucks in silver coins 😎
I just remembered The Delta Riggs are playing GTM this year. Thank you baby music Jesus ! 🙌🙌🙌
Need. Sleep. But. Sims.
Rhea catch ups are so great though. Except I feel like I want to slip into a Thai food coma for about three and a half days. 😷
