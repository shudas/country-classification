Congrats to everyone who made it into #PitchSlam!
Don't forget to let @brendadrake know if you've got a #pitmad success story.
I feel bad. I forgot it was dad's B'Day yesterday. Mainly because I send a message to Mum each year to help her get through it.

Hey @Rock_andor_roll - HANDS OF MY MG!! #NestPitch
I see 5 #NestPitch peeps in the final picks spreadsheet.
Each time I lose one I mark it with a :( so that there's still acknowledgement that I wanted it. #NestPitch
Nope - lost another one. A thriller. My precious!!!!! #NestPitch
I just found another one I lost. A really cool SciFi #nestPitch
I've lost two off my wish list as they were secondary picks instead of first pick. Contemporary &amp; Horror (which has wrong genre) #NestPitch
Have I teased enough? #NestPitch
I'm going to have to repick two entries off my Wishlist because other teams has marked them as top picks. #NestPitch
One MS in my wish list reminds me of predestination #NestPitch
One author knows I want her because I accidentally gushed in an email reply. #whoops  #NestPitch
One author in my wish list I've known for many years, but @ELWicker was the one to pick it so there's no favs going on #NestPitch
At least one entry in my wish list is set in space.#NestPitch
At least one MC of an MS in my wish list has a disability #nestpitch
At least one entry on my wish list has an Aussie link #nestpitch
At least one entry on my Wishlist has a Japanese link. #nestpitch
More than one entry on my Wishlist deals with ghosts. #nestpitch
All 13 are tagged by at least one other team. #nestpitch
There are 13 entries in my Wishlist #nestpitch
I've got at least two retelling a in my wish list. #nestpitch
Would anyone like some #nestpitch teasers?
The most successful Pitch Contest I'm involved with is #PitchWars. Looking forward to it this year. I'll be partnering with @staceynash
One thing I love about contests for the entrants is the definite timeframes. Very different to querying. #NestPitch

I could not only lose entries to other #NestPitch teams but to #PitchSlam as well. Nervous Wait
Kinda wishing that I could pick more for #NestPitch. I could easily have a team of 15.
But I may have to adjust my #WishList if other teams are putting my reserves as their first picks. #NestPitch
Genres on my full wish list: Suspense, SpecFic, SciFi, Urban Fantasy, Romance, Thriller, Horror, Historical. #WishList #NestPitch
My full wish list includes MG, YA, NA and Adult. #NestPitch
I've putting in my team Wishlist for #nestpitch. Now to wait for the other teams to finalise their Wishlist.
There are some writers I adore who have like five teams fighting over then #NestPitch
I've found 13 entries I want to work with and another five or so I could comfortably work with. Now to see how many I lose #NestPitch
Let's see how nice my #NestPitch co-mentors are now I've tipper my hand.
But either way I find it rude and annoying. 2/2
If you continually follow then unfollow me I will block you. I don't know if you're trying to get my attention or ditch me regularly 1/2
