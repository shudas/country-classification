That's women for you. Supportive. #BBCDebate  https://t.co/PHPA6ntBXy

I want to catch his eye!! #BBCDebate  https://t.co/xnOS0l0jnb
No. He said he wouldn't drop nukes in Isis. Concentrate!! #BBCDebate  https://t.co/0xdSng3e5t
Ed is looking really good tonight. #Ed4PM #WheresDave
But why didn't Clegg insist? https://t.co/Ga7mfkJFoW
Who? This debate is a breath of fresh air  without con Dems. #BBCDebate #WheresDave  https://t.co/6tlM3JQfcj
I'm a young leftie!! Wow. Thanks for the compliment. #WheresDave  https://t.co/qWABvjIk8h
Great to hear these 3 women debating so well. And to have 4 left leaning leaders. #WheresDave #bbbcdebate
Keep digging Farage. What arrogance!
Really or wicked gossip? https://t.co/tDuHY1IwHg
Fantastic!! https://t.co/7z3rx4zxNY
Why did lib Dems allow Cameron to tell them what to do? .@LibDemPress  https://t.co/oaATesKIFM
Great. Farage ignored again!! Not popular with a London audience. #WheresDave #BBCDebate
Brilliant. And giant haystacks could flatten Farage! #WheresDave #BBCDebate  https://t.co/n3WDUk0Ngw
I'm fed up with Dimbleby but I have to say he is a consummate performer. #WheresDave #BBCDebate
Sturgeon is being pressurised. She's making cuts &amp; being questioned on her policies. #WheresDave  #BBCDebate
That's it. Ignore Farage. #WheresDave #BBCDebate
Come on Ed!! #WheresDave
Farage is so predictable. Pugnacious &amp; dangerous. #WheresDave
LOL. Shame Cameron too chicken to appear &amp; answer. #WheresDave  https://t.co/ElYZmP1UGS
Is your telly different from mine? #BBCDebate  https://t.co/CHGiLBqVyz
Am I watching Just a minute? Sturgeon is gabbling like it is. #WheresDave
Rather humiliating opener. &amp; she is so nervous.  https://t.co/2sHKDpKrAC
Eek! https://t.co/HR2mlsngdZ
Hope so!! https://t.co/zSzVXZ5bgs
I wish our boos could be heard where Farage speaks. #BBCDebate
Feel nervous!! Come on Ed! https://t.co/gPYLhdJyuS
Come on Ed. #Ed4PM  https://t.co/uumykqJzmS
It might be different if msm wasn't so right wing &amp; full of vile attacks on him.  https://t.co/MfVPkeZyNx
#WheresDave can't see him on the telly.
Shocking conditions. Really distressing. This is all our problem, not just Spain or Italy.  https://t.co/Uh3X7NdsQ5
Seems odd that Cameron could stop him. How? No longer coalition bedfellows.  https://t.co/iyH9LSkVrF
Hope so! https://t.co/g3gS8YppFN
But is that true? Why wasn't he invited? Don't get it.  https://t.co/xQafDLgbpU
Why isn't Clegg taking part? https://t.co/mXSC6nFEMZ
Seriously, why isn't Clegg appearing tonight? #BBCDebate @UKLabour
