You have chronic douche face bud
When I say someone's beautiful, more often than not I'm talking about their soul. Who they are as a person. That's what I find beautiful
I'm gonna make sure that wherever I live in Australia, it has space for at least 2 people to stay with me so they can visit
You better 💖 https://t.co/3bsecZzZaI
IT JUST HIT ME IM GONNA BE LIVING IN AUSTRALIA FOR A WHOLE YEAR BY MYSELF AND IM FREAKING OUT
If people don't take the opportunity to visit me in the 12 months I'm in Australia, I'm going to be stupid amounts of sad
HOLY FUCK THATS LIKE 6 MONTHS AWAY
officially put through my payment to work in Australia in November this morning. Also decided on doing the full year
Listen to Michael Calfan @ Ultra Music Festival Mainstage 2015 (Live) by Michael Calfan #np on #SoundCloud https://t.co/Ls9yqpmaLd
I really don't wanna work today 😪
Honestly losing important people rips my heart out.
it sucks to have your best friend ripped away from you, but if they don't care enough to put the pieces back together, it's not worth it
There's honestly just some things in life you can't describe. Music is one of them
Crying listening to mark sixma's ultra set 😭 take me back home
She's a work in progress http://t.co/ux6LNJE9XF
Even though my brother and I don't see each other often, when we do.. We can talk for hours and hours on end about music and life. I love it
Plus I have some pretty cool shit locked away in my brain apparently 🙊
I forgot how much drawing puts my mind at ease
Only if I can have ur boobs  https://t.co/gNXvpehWQn
I feel like guys have this thing in their head that makes them believe girls dress to impress them. Maybe some girls but NAWT ME SORRY
"Ya I don't like ______ on you" OH REALLY? Well good thing I don't dress for you. I dress for myself. But thanks for the unwanted opinion

BOOBAHS OMG  https://t.co/pbQD0QnSQQ
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars ✨💫🌟
I've officially made the decision that whenever I go out to the bar, or work at stereo, I will always be wearing jewels/glitter on my face
If I can't wear glitter, lbds and listen to edm every single day of my life in the future,  I have failed
I feel like my personality is coming out more and more over the past month.
I'm stress eating about how I'm gonna make enough money for all these music festivals.
Today, I was techno af 👽🎶 https://t.co/0OvbP0fbA8
someone on their balcony below me is blasting the KREAM. remix of talking body.... Let's be best friends
They're fucking dope  https://t.co/oDrNSZi7GE
For real I'm kinda diggin the pigtails I won't lie to you
What I do in my spare time is so questionable
When you're techno af http://t.co/v4S08gsuDK
Okay. I need $5,000 to make these 7 festivals happen. How the FUCK am I gonna do that in 3 months...
I think SOS is a no go this year...... Too many other festivals
My day has consisted of Andrew rayel and dancing on my balcony. That is all. http://t.co/GejnSrRP0y
STOP THIS INSANITY I CANT AFFORD ALL THESE FESTIVALS I NEED TO START SELLING MY LIMBS. $50,000 FOR MY RIGHT ARM WHO WANTS IT
OKAY SHUT UP NO WAY  https://t.co/39AOLgfVkJ
Me too 🙌 it's gonna be amazing  https://t.co/gcBzEpjLpN
Okay this veld lineup is too much to handle. I'm gonna have a heart attack
Based on our music taste, I'd say @JaredBruceBlack and I are pretty much the same person
Doesn't mean you have to like listening to them, but simply appreciating the musical talent of different artists
Doesn't matter what your musical preference is, if you can appreciate all genres, that is something rare and unique to music lovers
For those who always ask me. I finally have an answer lol
Favourite producers/djs right now: tchami, Andrew rayel, kygo, porter Robinson, mark sixma
If I don't get famous from my wisdom teeth videos IT WILL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING AND I WILL BE PISSED
Also, my family had to fight over who's coming with me cause they all think I'm gonna be the funniest person of all time afterwords 😂
I've been on hold to get an appointment to get my wisdom teeth taken out for 25 mins now. WHY AM I ON HOLD I DONT EVEN WANT MY TEETH OUT
So many house djs/producers at veld this year. My prayers have been answered

The Veld lineup this year is almost bringing me to tears 😭💖🎶🙌
I hate when there's vines of electric forest but they put big room or hard style music in it... Doesn't fit. At all.

I just fucked my sleep tonight 😭😅
I just went into a coma for 4 hours damn
I can't tell if @BryceMysak is serious or kidding about Cowboys tbh ...
My dad high-fived me for punching that dickhole in the face last night. 😂
I do so much for people that literally don't do a fucking thing for me in return and I'm getting really goddamn sick of it.
I feel so proud for punching that dude out. Wow he fucking deserved that
Don't fuck with me. I can punch people now apparently 😅
Honestly certain people need to rot in hell. Sorry definitely not actually sorry
First time ever punching a guy in the face. First time a guys shoved me into a table. 

Great night
*drives to quiznos*

THE WORLD DOESNT WANT ME TO EAT
The amount of people that'll tell me "oh my god I went to a show/bar sober and it was so fun!!!" Makes me happy ☺️
I've 100% forgotten what it feels like to be fucked up lol

When you realize you can make lipstick out of any colour eyeshadow you want... That is a motherfucking game changer friends
I wonder if I can make blue lipstick out of blue eyeshadow and nude lipstick. We shall see
I have to work from 10pm today  - 5pm tomorrow with a 2 hour break from 5am-7am and truthfully I might not make it out alive
There's so many beautiful souls in this city ☺️
Walk into McDonald's and these random guys yell at me "TALIA RIGHT? I THINK IVE SEEN YOUR BUTT ON SOME EDM THING" 😂
