"Scott the Red" blocked me hahahahaha, yes!
*that's* how House of Cards ended!?
Don't even know what I'm laughing at there tbh.
FC United lost to Skem? Hahaha
Imagine watching a documentary on Carl Froch.
What a soft cunt.
Mandzukic's reaction to Carvajal hitting him HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
Atletico aren't the best team to watch are they?
What on earth was Casillas doing there?
State of Torres' hair now.
Got time for every Atletico player wanting to foul Ramos because he beat Mandzukic to a header.
Ref's bottled that.
What was Benzema doing there!?
Admire Benzema's ability to look like the best striker in the world one minute and an absolute pub footballer the next.
Hope Mandzukic does something stupid and gets sent off.
Mandzukic haha, grow up.
Good game this.
Look at Simeone waving his arms around on the touch line like it makes a difference.
Sergio Ramos is absolutely boss.
Watch all the Real fans cry because he didn't score there.
Juanfran plays for Spain over Azpilicueta?
