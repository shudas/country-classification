Farage coming across as that weird bloke on the top of a bus sitting next to bemused Miliband #bbcddebate
Ed going big on Trident: not much choice really #BBCDebate
Ed disagrees with Nigel not over immigration but the EU: clever #BBCDebate
Will Ed get stuck into Farage? #BBCDebate
F*rage f*cks up #BBCDebate
If you want to win with the worm, just talk magic moon beams not reality #BBCDebate
Just noticed Ed s tie is grey not red #highlysignificant #BBCDebate
Is this Let's Ask Ed? #BBCDebate
Conservatives will present this as dress rehearsal for chaotic Miliband govt: he is rightly knocking down the austerity deniers #BBCDebate
This debate gives Ed M the chance to look responsible compared to the austerity deniers #BBCDebate
I'm afraid I keep expecting Nicola Sturgeon to come out and say 'Fandabidozi' #BBCDebate
Miliband strategy must be to talk to viewers in English marginals, attack Cameron, and ignore this lot #BBCDebate
Ed Miliband keeps reminding viewers about the elephant not in the room: Cameron #BBCDebate
Unclear that nationalism's progressive credential are too great #BBCDebate
I suspect working families will get a few name checks tonight #BBCDebate
Will Cameron be tweeting a question? #BBCDebate
East Enders really building up the positive vibe for the Challengers Debate.
Ed Miliband just been playing pool on @ITV - he won.
Given Con stress on leadership of Cameron why aren't journalists pressing him on when exactly he'll stand down? He can't serve a full term.
When Uri Geller becomes your mouthpiece you might as well give up.
Are any other candidates giving away cash prizes in this campaign or is it just @grantshapps? @ElectoralCommUK http://t.co/4hwI231cE2
Blukip, Labservatives: what ridiculous amalgam will the LibDems come up with next? Oh, hang on a minute ... #LibDems
Blukip in 2015, Labservative in 2010: what will the Lib Dems come up with at the next election? http://t.co/HM2WTNcKYo

Hi @ElectoralCommUK is Grant Shapps guilty of 'treating' here? These are your rules: http://t.co/k0sQhEFjxp  https://t.co/PEnT2sRLKN

Sturgeon admits that the SNP wants their cake &amp; to eat it, to continue biting the hand that feeds, &amp; so on? https://t.co/FPKKhG8LWL
Just written a reference for one of our best students to work at Conservative Central Office: don't blame me if they now win!
Hats to the far left of them, hats to the far right of them, why don't our more centrist party leaders not wear hats?

Just read 2 chapters of @Eugoes forthcoming @ManchesterUP book on Miliband's attempt to move on from New Labour. I hope it's out soon!!
Another know-all doom-&amp;-gloom assessment of Labour which ignores electoral constraints:  very Ralph Miliband! http://t.co/1Y1iULBhlf
So: vote Lib Dem to stop the SNP or UKIP?
Is @nick_clegg a hero? Watch this TV drama and you may think so http://t.co/tZ338VVkGv via @ConversationUK
If the Lib Dems concede they wont form a government why produce a manifesto for a Lib Dem govt?
What @nick_clegg didn't say: 'This manifesto is ... negotiable'.
That @Ed_Miliband is seen as more than a right-wing social democrat says more abt our crazy politics than him http://t.co/NyDOGTJWBn

Is a promise something for coalition negotiations but a pledge something you actually intend to do? And what price an aspiration?
You know what, I think Bill Turnbull is reading from an autocue!

Cameron asking 'for five more years to finish the job' but if Cons form a govt in 2015 he wont be PM for 5 years: http://t.co/zSDwhfMrco

Why the Hell is everyone going on about The Good Life?
Is there really such a thing as 'the women's vote'? Wise words from self  but mostly @Rosiecampb http://t.co/Tt2FZEOiKm
Presumably the Conservatives think they know something we don't about their new right-to-buy policy, so what is it?
As Con campaign emphasises leadership might journalists be more interested in who will lead party in 2-3 years if they win the election?
Contenders for Tory leadership eye up their soon-to-be predecessor http://t.co/u6B5ngJl4N
Is the Conservative right to buy policy another £5-20 billion unfunded pledge? I guess that doesn't matter any more.

'I'm definitely pondering' a voter told the BBC today. Thanks to @selina_todd for that gem.
Those that claim David Miliband would have done it sooner and better might ponder why David lost.
