Sacking off pizza for cheese and beans toastie.
My friend has decided we should sit with a bunch of people that I really don't like. Tempted to leave.
Just told the pizza man to get our sweetcorn ready for later. He knows. He hates us. We care not. #pizza #sweetcorn

I need a life that doesn't involve consuming alcoh... Ohh wine!

I don't get the whole '@AmazingPhil and @danisnotonfire are my parents' thing... It's just... Idek.
I just want to cry. I do too much crying. I cried at Fast and Furious 7 today.
I'm losing my voice. It's so low and gruff. I legit sound like @AmazingPhil did yesterday on the radio. My friends think it's hilarious. 😞
Summer bevvy's 👍💕☀️ http://t.co/H6NOuoO4dp

My outfit for the night. For the first time in ages I feel really good about the way I look. 💕😊 http://t.co/Yqm4qUKqyv
Oh there we go, they've pushed me too far. I'm staying in. Why would I bother upsetting myself like this. I'm better off alone.
It's really getting to me now to the point I'm actually getting tearful.
I'm meant to be going out tonight but I really feel like no one wants me there.
My mum just said the Easter Egg aisle in Tesco on Friday was 'Choc-a-block'. She then realised what she'd said and sat laughing for 10 mins.
I can't handle how attractive Phil Lester is. 🙈
Family arriving for Easter dinner in 10... I have no clothes on, hair in a messy bun, no make-up... I'm so prepared.
Booked a hotel for my birthday weekend with my boyfriend. #SoExcited
Hiya, I'm Hannah but just call me 50p, Zebra or Leopard because apparently my real name isn't good enough. 😂
My nickname is 50p. :(
Thank God for phone insurance.
So ready for home. How I've made it to 3.30 am sober I will never know.
As if. My friend Adam tweeted that last tweet. 😂😂😂😂
Have u ever sucked cock?
Old school Kanye 👌👌👌
And now in have drink all over my legs. 🙅🙅🙅🙅
There's some states out tonight. Girl just puked all over herself. Her mates took her out and left her. They came back in. #StayClassyLough
The people here need to go home. I swear me and my friends are the only ones sober enough to be here.
Man handshake cos I'm a man.
WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO... IT'S THE REMIX TO IGNITION... #remix
I am way too sober for the amount I've drank...
Oh god. Now she's talking about how a black person has to respect her cos she 'gets black cock every night' 😂😂😂😂 she's nuts.
My mate just complained about how her toes are slipping out her shoes and proceeded to sing "THESE TOES AIN'T LOYAL!" I'm crying. 😂😂😂😂
Seeing your ex on a night out. 🙅🙅🙅🙅
Got a growth on my knee ent I? Cheeky git. 😂😂😂 #BestfriendGoals http://t.co/AeiSmlFJ3I
Why come out to meet your friends then go to a completely different place, knowing full well your friends don't want to go to that place. 😒😤
Can I go to Australia and meet @JonWillTweet yet?
Seriously, I've been here an hour and I've had a bottle of cider, 2 vodka red bulls, 3 vodka lemonades and a shot of sambucca. 👌💕🍻
I enjoy alcohol far too much. 👌🍻
Napping on my friends floor. 😂😂😂😂😂
Going out tonight. Already getting ready.

I can't cope today.
Ooh I've made some grammatical errors today within speech. Every time I did, I died a little inside!
I'm in a group chat on FB &amp; cos I'm working most of the day I barely reply but when I do, someone says 50p like I'm a slot machine. 😂😞
Everyone should subscribe to @JonWillTweet on youtube as well as following his twitter, insta and liking his Facebook page. :) FANKS.
It's 11am and I'm ready for bed. Being a nanny is exhausting. I love my adoptive niece so much but she isn't half a handful! 😂💕😭😴👧
Feel like I've not spoken to @JonWillTweet in ages. So.. Jon... *please see picture.* xx http://t.co/zBKv6YpFCO
Literally gonna punch my boyfriend. #arse
Had my nails done again today. I've already snapped one. #newrecord
Spent all day cleaning my room. It's still a state.
Aw, found an old table plan for my Year 3's from two years ago. Scary to think how grown up they'd be now. :( http://t.co/lxrJNXWxaZ
So glad that @thetomska mentioned PCOS in his puberty video. I was diagnosed aged 16 and had never heard of it. #thankyou
Congratulations @Joe_Sugg on reaching 4 million subscribers! ☺️ you should be proud of everything you have achieved. #CongratulationsJoe
Upset my housemates by walking round singing Jolly Phonics songs at the top of my voice. :)
"Shut up. I'll beat you on the arse!" This is what the 4 year old just said to me. 😂😂😂 she's on time out now.
I'm literally dropping Moolee off at nursery tomorrow and going back to bed. No lies.
I can't breathe. I'm not impressed. If my lungs would like to start functioning then that would be grand...
I think it might have to go to a&amp;e. I can't breathe. :(
I'm going to murder the child I nanny for. I'm poorly, it's 1am &amp; she is stomping round the house... I don't think so kid, go back to bed! 😴
Biology with Han: just had to explain the female anatomy to my 23 year old friend. It's worrying as she has a 4 year old...
I'm so ill. :( full of cold &amp; chest infection &amp;  I've spent the day nursing my niece who has a tummy big. Lots of vomit and runny noses. :(
