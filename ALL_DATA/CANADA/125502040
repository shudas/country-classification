Well I'm sort of butt hurt after seeing that...
Okay well now I'm a little bit confused...
Opening day in the Motor City! #TigersOpeningDay #TigersBaseball
I'm having a "shaved one leg, but forgot the other" kind of day...
It ain't me babe, it ain't me you're looking for..
This is a normal conversation for me and my sister. I'm not at all surprised üòÇ http://t.co/ovBeKgjBwk
Nice and balmy today... http://t.co/fWmXtLg4BQ
In the middle of my little mess, I forget how big I'm blessed
If you're ever gonna find a silver lining, it's gotta be a cloudy day
Spend v-day with Mr. P. Swayze, copious amounts of red wine, and my yooper best friend. Couldn't ask for much more üç∑üíù
It is what it is, till it ain't anymore...
Desperate for changing, starving for truth
Something about you now, that I can't quite figure out..
I just want someone to love me like Nathan loves Haley üò≠ #OneTreeHill
Drinking wine and putting off my homework.. Yup it's a Wednesday night
If I see another tweet starting with "I literally can't"
Usher starts with playing downstairs and I get these texts... üòÇüòÇüòÇ http://t.co/ZIZbcVW0vK
Here goes night number 3 #mtuwc
Currently missing my best friend like crazy üò• @Lizard_Merrill
My decision making skills resemble that of a squirrel trying to decide to cross the road...
Then almost got groped by him...
On a different note, ashley and I got called "sexy sexies" by an alcoholic 60 year old man at the bar...
Quarter beers here I come #mtuwc
Oh Jack D.. It had been a while since the last time I've made bad decisions on you.
Once you see a face in your doorknob... It never goes away http://t.co/rgRppaTfF1
Classy Minnesota shit http://t.co/5spgWtSwss
Apparently I really want Nutella because I wrote it on my grocery list twice...
So much for my nap. I swear people only text me when I'm trying to sleep üòû
I know enough about you to know all I wanna do is find out a little bit more..
Grow up and take responsibility for your actions. Don't blame everyone else for your mistakes.
Yep good talk
üòï
Thank you for sending me a selfie every day. Sometimes I worry that I will forget what you look like if I don't get one...
I just wanna go back to my little small town. I'm not made for a city
I can't wait to get out of this town again. There are way to many fucking people here!
Cant wait for new #GrangerSmith and #EarlDibblesJr music!
On my only day off I get woken up at 6:30... Whyyyy #fts
Damn lay of the selfies
Shut up potlicker, I'll put you in the microwave!
Pretty disappointed with @OtterBox. It took 5 days for them to ship out my one phone case when a confirmation email said 24 hours.
Why yes, waking up at 4 in the morning sick as a dog is exactly how I wanted to start my day
Love don't come easy, it's a game of give and take
Now that's a chaw ladies and gents. @EarlDibblesJr http://t.co/Yo9B8a4EQu
Otis Redding may be the only thing that'll get me through this project
Makes you wonder who's doing right with someone tonight, and who's car is parked next door...
I don't think my brother in law understands the concept of snapchat. It's very entertaining üòÇ
Worked with excel for 14 hours today and get to do it all over again tomorrow. #joy
I feel so loved by my fall camp family :) #happytweet
I had pounding heart, an aching head, and no regrets...
When people get a little too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them. -Swanman
Both rooms next to me are being loud as fuck...
Sometimes I like to sit at my roommates desk to do my homework.. Just so I don't have to clean mine off..
The only argument @Lizard_Merrill and I ever have is who misses the other more...
Fuck... I told myself I wasn't gonna go there
I think my heart skips a beat when you throw your hat on backwards...
Words can't describe how important he is to us, and how heartbroken we all are.
Praying for Peter. He has influenced every single person here at fall camp in a positive way, and does not deserve this in the slightest
That rage moment when someone calls your best friend their best friend... @Lizard_Merrill
I will choose star gazing and yote calling any night over being responsible and doing my homework.
Jason Aldean's old music&gt;&gt;
#NUM! #ExcelProblems
Dustin Lynch's new album üëå #perfect #WhereItsAt
I want to do hoodrat stuff with my friends
The full moon shining through my blinds is brutal tonight http://t.co/7cR9Z1YKYv
Trying to read a scientific journal article and having to look up every third word on Wikipedia... #fucindity?
"TSC should be called Pet Food and Hardware Supply Co. because they ain't got shit for tractors!"
Not sure why I wasted my night watching Escanaba in da moonlight
Once I finish this paper I am rewarding myself with kettle corn. #chopchop
Probably should have skipped that nap today
They took care of my drunk ass and put me to bed last night
I have such amazing friends
Koalas in the rain....no fucks given!"
All this sand volleyball is a really good exfoliant for my legs
I'm gonna hurt so bad tomorrow
#struggling
Guess I'm not as put together as I thought....
Aaaaand I washed my face #boooooom #owningit
When I can still brush my teeth after a night of drinking I feel like my like is put together
When a guy throws their hat on backwards.... #MmmYeah #GiveMeASecond
It would be great if the internet in this hell hole wouldn't go out every 3 minutes!
You and your mom are hillbillies! This is a house of learned doctors!"
That was rough.
I actually get to live here. It's ok to be jealous. http://t.co/mVYjQEiG61
My RA- "If you're cool, were cool, and it'll all be cool"  I think it's gonna be a good semester.
I just need a venting session with my best friend üò≠ @Lizard_Merrill
The only thing getting me through this weekend is aunt Kim's peanut butter fudge
What a waste of fucking time üò°
I ‚ù§Ô∏è @Lizard_Merrill. I'm gonna miss you so much! I promise to not make any other best friends if you don't http://t.co/blfW7JB9c0
Found this washcloth in the linen closet üò• http://t.co/zdyzOeJqqx
This stuff is amazing!!! Completely took away my redness! I love @NyxCosmetics http://t.co/Ky0zri1vSj
So surreal I'm moving again in 2 days
So happy with my experience at @ULTA_Beauty today. The employee who helped me was amazing!
My clothes and phone reek of burnt easy Mac. Thanks Joey üòÇ
What's so wrong with the new fb messenger app that is making everyone freak out? I don't understand
"Don't become friends with her or I'll light her on fire" @Lizard_Merrill
I'm 21 in my senior year of college and I'm moving into my first dorm next week. This is a weird feeling...
Had a dream that a man with a gun was trying to get in my bathroom window last night....
Pizza and hot sauce is the best thing in my life right now...
I tried to unlock the house with the cottage key... I need to go to bed
Brb dying üòÇüòÇ #ImpracticalJokers
Oh I just love being excluded
Keep it to yourself, if you think that you still love me. Put it on a shelf. If you're looking for someone, make it someone else
Dear pretzel place, why are you open if you dont have any pretzels ready yet? Thank you for breaking my heart
Should not have taken that nap today..
"There's a strawberry stuck in my penis... I need to blow it out!" http://t.co/heuOdpHWtX
Conway and George Strait never did it this way, back in the old days
Impractical jokers may be the funniest show I've ever watched
Hit the snooze button as many times as possible this morning. #Struggling
There ain‚Äôt no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Permanently have Keith, Tim, and Miranda songs stuck in my head #FasterHorses
Oh, you always had to be right, but now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
Well then...
Thank you #FasterHorses, now I am going to smell like bonfire, smoke, and weed at work today. Totally worth it tho
Tim was so amazing #FasterHorses http://t.co/CI8eMW3B7y
