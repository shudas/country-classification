DJ AJ brings Dora Da Explora 2 da mix @amandajayner_
So @amandajayner_ and I just listened to the Dora the Explorer soundtrack in public, and now she's trying to say she wasn't and it's all me.
This has been a public service announcement. Thank you.
Or use the service button like a normal human being
However, I strongly feel people should start trying other flats
The door to our building is broken and keys don't work in it either, so if anyone locks the door no one can get in
I don't know you your lack of keys is not my problem
