Someone take me to Aberdeen so I can lock myself in my room and never leave
Just jump
Nothing like a chat with an old friend to make you feel better ðŸ˜Š
How have I only just discovered pretty little liars?
So happy to have @_whatglennadid back in my life ðŸ’•
Where has this surge of motivation come from?!
See things differently
I seriously need to start getting fit and healthy or I'll turn into a pie
Essay submitted this morning and then got to enjoy a day in the sun

When you know something is all your fault but there's nothing you can do to change it
Can't wait to get back to my room
Appendix done!
Can never sleep anymore
Slut
Nice wee night watching movies and eating chips with @MairiGalbraith

Being the only one in the waiting room at the GPs at 7.20 in the morning is kind of creepy
Got one of the piercings under my collarbone caught in the scrunchie in the shower and I swear I've never felt pain like it
