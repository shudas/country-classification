Sleep is for the weak @alligaida
As soon as this take-home has been submitted, I'm cracking open a bottle of red.
Justice Gordon, slay.
I came here to have a good time and I'm honestly feeling so attacked right now @alligaida
To the boys making demeaning comments on new Facebook friendships with girls. Desist.
Long case names, pls. I have a very limited word count.
I'm in a unilateral relationship with you right now @alligaida
I can't get no (satisfactory finance).
Quote: @alligaida "I don't know what has happened in Contracts for the past three weeks".
WHY ARE WE HERE @alligaida @AlisonLouise96
Waking up to a flooded car really sets the benchmark for today.
"Hi, can I please have a cuppy-cino?"

Um, sure.
Week 1 v Week 6. http://t.co/aUnpjo79du
Top 3 orders for today:
1) latte with "no froth"

Check yourselves, people.

When ur lecturer doesn't know what the law means @JjesseKilburnn
Realising the only thing you have consumed today is an egg. Someone bring me food, pls.
Deterred from doing Arts readings in the Law Library due to fear of judgement. I DO LAW TOO, OKAY?
Brave face.
AUES Pub Crawl: 1
Airlie: 0
Blonde again. Thank goodness.

My hair is brown - I want to cry.

Pride &amp; Prejudice soundtrack on repeat #noshame @Claire_LMartin
I need to stop impulse buying leisure books, because I know, in my heart, the only books I'll ever get time to read will be text books.

Reasonable driver: turns on lights and slows down to reduce risk.
SA driver: remains invisible and speeds, 'cause fk u logic'.
Those "noises" you hear at night? Well, tonight that was a mix tape of my cat accidentally turning on the kitchen blender/hissing in terror.
*me* - yeaaah, partay
*health* - nah bish
Hospitalised on the night that I actually planned to do something about my social life.
Looking forward to Andrew's dank clip art animations @RachaelIngleton
The law library is a lonely place past 6pm.
Tfw you realise how much reading you haven't done. http://t.co/7xkCh0qRgG
I have wasted my entire evening on tumblr.
My parking issues are getting ridiculous.
Caffeine hit me like: http://t.co/CEcdacEUBY
The word 'wanderlust' needs to be removed from the English language.
SLAY PEPSI ACTOR @alligaida
Andrew loves the puff.
Andrew's bucket list = edgy.
Offer and acceptance is so relevant to my parking struggles this week.
Ashton v Pratt - pls.
Week 2 - not improving @Claire_LMartin
You know you've picked the right degree when:

"equytie is ordeyned ... to myttygate the rygoure of the lawe".

Wordis of the lawe pls.
I've completely disregarded my intention to complete the additional readings for Law this semester...
A man just poured his latte into his drink bottle and left. Still processing.
This evening's bus trip:
- annoyingly drunk bimbos
+ headphones 
+ annoyingly drunk elderly men

Circumstances improving? I think not.
GET ME OFF THIS BUS.
P.S., your fake eyelashes are falling off.
No one cares that you're going to do "ABC shots all night".
Bus trips on a Saturday night = annoyingly drunk girls bitching about other girls and taking selfies on the back seat.
*using Twitter instead of Facebook to avoid crippling and unnecessary judgement*
When you forget you have earphones in and walk away from your laptop. Ugh. http://t.co/RoOaP5Diiz
When the slay takes over @alligaida
SLAAAY @alligaida

Boilermakers' or? @RachaelIngleton @AlisonLouise96 @Claire_LMartin @wutaingclan
Lecture drinking games? @RachaelIngleton @Claire_LMartin

Eating breakfast at 3.30pm - no worries.
Post-gig depression is setting in. Thank you for an amazing night, @Chet_Faker. http://t.co/JsFEehgbyl
Twelvies everywhere @wutaingclan
Nevertheless, with bae @wutaingclan about to see bae @Chet_Faker
It should be illegal for tall people to be at the front of the mosh @wutaingclan #shortgirlstruggles
I need help @alligaida
I swear, if one more James Bay album promo interrupts my music stream...
They call me the matchmaker @RachaelIngleton @alligaida @wutaingclan @AlisonLouise96
Washed out my own mouth this evening by accidentally swallowing shampoo whilst showering. My tastebuds are currently in rehab.
Uni starts soon. http://t.co/XI5cNvxtXx
The one day you don't wear makeup. 

'Oh, are you sick?'

Yeah, cheers.
Mid-semester drinking game: take a shot for every reading you've missed.
*crippling excitement intensifies* @AlisonLouise96 @alligaida
Getting ready to expose myself to Titanic @alligaida @AlisonLouise96
It just dawned on me that I have never seen Titanic.
MacBook Pro or MacBook Air? Help.
Copious amounts of alcohol + a bouncy castle = an inevitable injury.
Today on OCD Law Student: the infuriating result of smeared text and bleeding after highlighting the Bible-thin pages of the Contracts book.

There's a threequel of 'Taken'? How much more can that poor family handle?!
Saddened to learn that Lord Richard Attenborough has passed away. Your stunning directing will not be forgotten. http://t.co/76rEBrf1GK
Why does every Pixar movie that doesn't need a sequel get one when 'The Incredibles' is just sitting there ripe for the picking. Honestly!
Time to get motivated! #meetingdeadlines #studentlife
Today I have managed to make myself 5 cups of tea. Did I end up drinking any of them? Nope.
If only I could be in two places at once! #needaclone
