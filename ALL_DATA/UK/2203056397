I love Apple but they really should remove the 'available on the 24/3/2015' on their #AppleWatch advert when nobody is going to get one then
#AppleWatch shipments for 4-6 weeks / June preorders could be dispatched early is the best thing since #OneMoreThing http://t.co/IvZZfOYMvE
Must admit, the new music app on iOS 8.4 Beta looks so fresh and so clean... http://t.co/w525yG4wUZ

The taptic feedback on the #AppleWatch is surprisingly good, it literally made me jump when I tried on the watch and looked away üòÅ‚åöÔ∏è
I wonder how many Ô£ø‚åöÔ∏è#AppleWatch were actually in stock at 8:01am this morning before they sold out ? #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmm
Girl you know it's true @erfon  https://t.co/viv8ePYJxA
By the time Erfon's Ô£ø ‚åöÔ∏è arrives, the apple watch 2 will be announced https://t.co/70qNmN28VA
Haven't heard anyone who preordered their Ô£ø  #AppleWatch slag off any of the rivals out there , I wonder why üññ
Predicting that the estimations of opening preorder day for #AppleWatch Ô£ø are gonna be smashed and this is only gen 1... Intense
I hear some Samsung phone that bends is being released today ? Can someone clarify  #AppleWatch #WhoGivesADamnAboutTheGalaxy

Farewell Walking Dead &amp; Fortitude, hello MadMen, Game of Thrones, True Detective and DareDevil
First it was the ridiculous Cleric, now it's Father Gascoigne to haunt my journey through Yharnam #Bloodborne http://t.co/yE3aaiCp9g
I expected a more conclusive ending than this but overall I was totally creeped out by this wonderful show #Fortitude see you in 2016
This is the most messed up finale for #Fortitude wasps, jam, scissors, mammoths

Waters will keep running and rivers will turn... #Fortitude http://t.co/R06TriUIZ9

Personally, I would not have chosen this song if I was Stevie on #TheVoiceUK it's all open now...
It's time for #TheVoiceUK

Pondering whether to go #PS4 or #XboxOne for #BattlefieldHardline this Friday....
#BlackButler on #Netflix is dark and hilarious with possibly the worst British accents I've ever heard
#AttackOnTitan is the most exciting anime on #Netflix right now by a mile... Just gets better and better by the episode !!!
Perhaps the best performance I've seen all season by our boys, the starting 11 is who we need to take to Anfield next week... #MUFC #ManUtd
This show is getting darker and creepier and sinister by the hour #Fortitude @fortitude
Cmon PSG !!! #CampaignAgainstChelsea
Cmon Paris St Germain #CHEPSG Zlatan is probably in the changing room eating lobster and laughing his Swedish ass off
Hahaha cmon SideShowBob !!! Fuck You Chelsea Scum
Zlatan Ibrahimovic should have at least broken Oscar's leg when he got sent off... Racist Blue Scum

We are the luckiest team in the premiership tonight, played absolutely awful and still we nick it at the last few minutes #ManUtd #MUFC
This is the worst performance I've seen since last week #ManUtd gonna be pushed out of the top four far too easily #MUFC
Too much to watch, too much to play, never enough time to sleep... No rest for the wicked...
Absolutely loving how dark and twisted and cold @fortitude is becoming... And we all thought the polar bears were the threat... ‚ùÑÔ∏è
It would seem that there is no rest for the wicked with #BattlefieldHardline and #Bloodborne coming out this March on #XboxOne and #PS4
I dunno which will be more difficult, keeping these new babies clean or stopping @Toulouse8it from stealing them http://t.co/aXCpwG3OpY
#DyingLight #TheOrder1886 #Evolve #ACUnity way too much to play this March, hoping for no new surprises this month #PS4 #XboxOne
