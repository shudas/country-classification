Easily my hardest quarter of school, academically and personally. But the love of friends&amp;family helped me make it my best ever. 4.08 baby!
Currently in SD, Austin next month, DC in May, Minnesota in July. Travel is cool.
#DearNativeYouth your voice is what matters most. Have respect, but don't let others tell you how to feel.
#DearNativeYouth you are not the stereotype. Don't let others tell your story.
#DearNativeYouth it will ALWAYS get better. No matter what, you can always find love &amp; support from others
#DearNativeYouth you are the leaders of tomorrow! Be the change you hope to see for your people.
#DearNativeYouth you are all unique and special.
#DearNativeYouth you are more than an image or name. Know that your voices are important and can make change.
#DearNativeYouth you are the result of past warriors and leaders. Keep your heads held high and fighting the good fight.
