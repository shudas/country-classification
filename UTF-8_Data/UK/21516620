6hrs driving, for 5hrs taking pics in stunning Applecross, but no biking. Hmmmm, trail building is better.
Darn it, drivetrain on the MTB shagged, reckon I'll have to give up on 3x9. 2x10 beckons....
Those Giant helmets are goping.
Back home and end of day ride with n°1 son; dry trails, low evening sun, legs out, fab. http://t.co/uUMQzkCBs1
Oh great, let's round off our city break with a visit to Ikea. *sighs*
Cities eh? Full of people. Noisy. Couldn't live in one. #okforavisit
Nº1 son going bonkers on the Gorms today. http://t.co/cSnOr7zugY
Forgotten just how good DSLR's are at focussing and how heavy they are #microfourthirdsuser
Leaders debate second bottle.... #leaderdebate http://t.co/90f7cbyPf2
Damn, finally realised I need full frame.
Happens every 'summer'.... http://t.co/Lp8XiihMk5
Here we go again. Bike away, skis out. http://t.co/VlmjSs5oVl
Gone all wintery again. http://t.co/5nmemzcfRW
Bit down hard on the MTFU bullet today, hard 2hrs on the roadbike. Done.
Flippin' fab ski up the Gorm today, there's life left in the season yet!
F1 qualifying, about as boring as watching a time trial...
Morning on the mtb at Laggan, afternoon on the skis up the Gorm, now beer. #nowthatsafriday
Nearly Easter eh? #heatedseatsstillon https://t.co/WUYMj84bhj
Weather yeuch, so off to shoot interiors in a plush pad. Nice.
Wowsers, great snow forecast for the Gorms, might have to wax the skis one more time!
Oh lordy, I've been banging away at the keyboard all day and it's stunning out there. F*ck it, clients can wait, I'm going out on my bike.
N°1 son doing a power point presentation for his homework; since when did 9yr olds do ppp's and I'd forgotten how much I dislike ms software
Jeezo, remind me to never photograph an event for a favour! #monsterspeededitsesh
Oh for goodness sake; 1 x puncture fixed, then 1 broken valve on tubeless tyre. Bugger this for a game of soldiers, I'm going skiing.
Gotcha http://t.co/7QSELJpLov
So N°1 son is a ski racer - third in Scottish primary schools ski finals. Woohoo as they say, I celebrated for him with a glass of red.
Does a two hour road ride qualify for wine and cheese board? It had better had, I'm on my second glass #recoverydrink
That's it, suns broken through, temps on the way up, I'm off out on me bike.
Oh ye gads! Mrs Aviemoron and n°1 son off ski racing which means everyone's up at 05.30 #brewneeded
Blog update
http://t.co/eWo8L30dNI
Editing pics since 5 to make room for bike ride at 10. Need more miles! #stillonbase
Hmmm, to tilt shift or not to tilt shift. #expensivedecisions
Oh ye gads, just rediscovered the delights of winter road miles in cold, wet, windy weather. I'm off to the bath.
At last, a midweek ride day, I don't care that it's 2°c and gusting 60mph, I'm going riding. #butfirstmorecoffee
Nope, still don't fancy it #strathpuffer
Deep @jojoa1 deep. #strathpuffer
Coffee, drum n bass, chocky biscuits, a sugar filled rush of photo editing.
A full day of photo editing and new workflow using Lr, could be a slow day. #gonnaneedsomegoodtunes
Busy week done, virtually no riding, that's pants. #workbikebalance
Trail graffiti #ripitupandstartagain I said #ripitupandstartagain Oh god, that's today's ear worm then... http://t.co/LKbrIt7CDx
More snow in the Strath, think I'll scrap this pointless pursuit of 'base' miles...
Winter mountainbiking round here requires some 'extra' skills... http://t.co/XFLRfy3N3E
Scottish skiing = learning how to not moan in queues #frustrating #windy #characterbuilding  #theBritishway
A good week; built some trail, rode my bike and cleared some doubles, now beer and curry.
A day of pushing a wheelbarrow. No turbo tonight. #creamcrackered
Santa Cruz Stigmata - YouTube now this I can relate to. Been fighting the n+1 urge for ages, but..... https://t.co/txLuykZuO6
Yesterday, dry sunny singletrack, today snow. Scottish weather is bonkers. #winterbiking #aviemore http://t.co/ilHS4OAUrF
Didn't fancy skiing and the boys wanted to ride. Win. http://t.co/c5OXno3wyb
I give in. I just can't stay up to watch all of 2001.
Turbo training to F1 engine sounds #weirdo
Laggan Wolftrax, devastation everywhere. http://t.co/DT5c66jvWW
Nope, they're defo not doubles, this is an xc trail don't you know... http://t.co/G2N8JwQVNp
So, 'luxury' turbo training in the front room with big stereo, big telly, etc, nullified by central heating and lack of fan #sweatycarpet
Home alone tonight, turbo might have to come into the front room!
Aaaagh, way too late to bed after a day trail building and a long evening of trying to get my head round a move to Lightroom!
Fearsome windy on the road bike today, some 39x25, some 53x12.
Darn it, hills closed - too windy for skiing, best go do some of that Sunday morning road cycling thing then #wintermiles
Researching new photo workflows #rocknroll
Just in, first day trail building of 2015, early start to the season and doesn't the body know it. #earlybeddies
A 'gaggle' (?) of telemarkers. http://t.co/O11T8gkTRS
Right, temps are up, snows melting, best start building trails again. 2015 here we come. 
Maybe just a quick mornings ski first...
In the big ring.
A full day, with no skiving, in the office today, surely that justifies some playtime tomorrow.
3 days skiing = close curtains, ignore sunshine and GET SOME WORK DONE!
Took Nº1 son off piste today up the hill, braw. Excellent day all round and a belter of a weekend. http://t.co/U95mcQRWQu
