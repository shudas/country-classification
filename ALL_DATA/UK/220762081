anyone know anything about IFile? Its an ap for Ipad that you have to pay for..
I did all my own work &amp; worked hard by myself then others are getting the grades that the uni's want &amp; here I am proud of my merits lol
I get frustrated when other people do access courses that are supposed to be the same as I did &amp; the workload is easier &amp; they get help :-(
I believe in positive thinking however sometimes you do have to doubt something to avoid disappointment later... trying to stay optimistic

I just won my son in my first game of snooker I am very happy about this as he is very good however he says he went easy on me?!
In a way to which people have stopped having their own opinions?The media itself pushes people to believe everything they read...
Obviously social media gives people the chance to express their views and opinions on a large scale but do these views then impact others?
Sometimes I wonder if social media and the general media have an impact on people's general views...
Really hope I get a good night's sleep tonight having cold and shingles is no fun :-(
Obviously just not warmed up yet
I swear it feels like the heating isn't on and a window is wide open in here this morning...but know heating on full windows closed :-/

Midwives Among 400,000 Striking Health Workers http://t.co/83JwznevkV
I fully support the midwifery strikes 2moro as it is about time they are recognised &amp;appreciated although I do feel for the expectant mum's
Maybe people will realise what a great job #midwives do tomorrow often underpraised underpaid&amp; overworked we're lucky in the UK to have them
So glad I don't work Monday's #rain #dentist numb mouth so snuggling up in bed for an hour before a trip to @LoveMeadowhall
Hmm odd is it possible for a phone to call someone without you calling them nor it being in your call log for recently dialed numbers?
Just on the way home from an awesome business meeting #bringiton #nutrition #health
I can't explain exactly how I feel right now sickened,heartbroken,saddened &amp; angry how on earth can someone do such a horrid thing #mancdogs
Think it's time for an afternoon nap... Zzzz
Thinking about relearning a foreign language since it's 12 years since I did &amp; poor @ it just don't know if to go night school or go private
Is dreaming of a better life... contemplating on what would be the best step forward
Has had an amazing holiday with my family and is now back to reality listening to my dogs snor under my bed Zzzz ♥
