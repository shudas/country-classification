Guys I still need a roommate for the summer 😯😐
I wish Lamar had a Zumba class or a yoga class.. I would probably really like working out then.
I'm proud of Clay, he has finally left the iPhone family.and joined the galaxy family
Guess who's going to summer jams 2015! 🙋😄😎
Allergies are kicking my butt 😢😥
Think I'm going to get an afro 😄
I slept for 17 hours 😯 😴 that kinda scares me
"@OohxSweets: 😖😖😖😭  “ https://t.co/4zU3ntyf2n #spidervine”" @_Felicityy719  hope you have a great day
I could use a cuddle buddy right about now 🙌🐻
I'm just going to pretend lastnight never happened.
It's true what people say, you really do meet some of the best people in college 💕
All I want to do is sleep.. but I can't stop coughing 😷😵
I suck at the whole texting back thing.
The train is making my pictures on my wall shake... 😦 I'm mentally preparing myself for one of them to fall and scare me.
I'm so sad about my phone... a part of me has died
Why did I get an otter box when it did nothing for the screen!?
I dropped my phone and broke the screen. Anthony ' s advice to me: "Did you try turning it off then on again? Or try putting it in rice" 😢😦
Ughhh work is going to kick my ass today.
Well Madi and I are going to attempt to make cinnamon rolls.. 😁😋
"@CoronetDiamonds: Motivation #hustle http://t.co/LlbhAEQOfh" my life 😊💰👠👑💳💲💎💍
Fish update: it's still in my tub... but clay cleaned out the dirty wanted and put fresh water in the tub 😡😠😓
#ImGoingToSellMyRoomMate
The fish is still in my tub 😢 😦
Woke up to an alive catfish in my bathtub. 😣🐟 Paybacks coming Clay... 👿
Lamars YikYak is a joke. I feel like a person writes a post about themselves just for attention.
No words can explain how hungover I am right now 😯😷
Ughhhh 😷
I've learned who my real friend are, sad I wasted so much time on fake, temporary friends.
Let's all get drunk tonight on green drinks! 🙌😄🍀🍻🍺
I'm the friend that orders a foot long sub while all the other girls order 6 in sub. 
#oops #WatchingMyFigure
I obviously don't follow the right people on twitter 😒🏀💍
I really need to find someone to be down to come over and watch movies all night long.
I'm just kinda lost in life.
I'm about to walk home.
Getting off work this late knowing I have to be back at work in 6 hours makes me really sad 😣
I just want to be happy again.
Kinda want to talk to you, but I hate you.
I love you and hate you.

First time biting into corn in the cob in 3 years! 😍😋

Sloppy seconds. Have fun bitch.
Boy, you're not messing up my make up. ✋
"@_eNeLyAhS_: I'm such a terrible texter." Story of my life!!
I want to help. I just don't know how to approach you.
I was having a good time snap chatting @Andrade2203 ... until he SCREENSHOTTED! 
#NotTodaySatin
For a boy 🎶
Just jumping in a truck, driving down a dirt road is all I want right now. Summer come faster!  
#ABoyfriendWouldBeNice
Watch out neighbors Madi, Emily,  and I are going to attempt to have a bonfire 😆😆
It's annoying how parents don't teach their kids how to act in public.
I'm so hungry but I do not want to leave my bed.
Worst idea ever: Play running man with country boys. They dropped us off on a random dirt road. 😯😣
#ImSoSoar #Ran4Miles
It's crazy how in one day your life can turn upside down
Sometimes you have to throw it in the "fuck it" bucket and move on with life.
I hate shutting off my light to go to bed, and I hit my shin on my bed frame 😦😩😣
"@30SecondTuts: How to kiss. http://t.co/PGpYIo13Jl" what did I just watch? ! 😯😐
Las bricas for dinner 😋
Why do you shut your old friends out just because you have a girlfriend now?
Is it bad I want to look homeless to my own party?
"@girlideas: the most important everyday products http://t.co/xLsl7QuVZe" @EmilyAnnePrit
I have an eating problem. I eat too much.
Its bad that I care about work more then my school. 😞😩
I'm so excited for Friday night! 😄💪
Well I set the alarms off at work. Not how I wanted to start my morning 😔😣
"@LifeCheating: Have painful gas? http://t.co/J8ZrB3VvcM" just to save some life's.
I'm having so much fun watching Morgan play just dance 😂😂😂
