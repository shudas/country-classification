When everything hits the fan you realize who really rides with you.Your circle is gonna continue to get smaller. It's just about consistency
Nothing is ever how it seems. It's just were its portrayed from. It's your angle, your ability to be biased and judgmental based friends etc
So glad I got to workout today. Got everything off my chest.
+ vibes is all I want.
Your laughs are the greatest.
Some of the coolest nights I've had have been w/ you... Have been because of you.
