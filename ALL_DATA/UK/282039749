If i had the money I would pack up my stuff and get out of the north west, start fresh just me and my baby boy and never look back.
So yeah cos of my 'best friend' i am in a place i don't wanna be in. So where are you supposed to turn? :/ #feelinglonely
"I don't wish what I've been put through on my worst enemy" no but you'll let me ur so called best friend get put through it by ur doings!!!

Can't believe my little dude is already 6ibs12oz!! Little chunk :)
Get to see my little man again tomorrow &amp; then I'll finally meet him!! Midwife reckons he'll be here in the next 2 weeks, he's so engaged!!!
Today I learned that being pregnant and heat really isn't a good combination :(
36 weeks down, 4 weeks to go.
I can't stress domestic violence enough. Its not just physical abuse, its emotional and psychological as well and its just as bad.
So proud of myself :)

I CAN OFFICIALLY SAY I AM DUE NEXT MONTH 👶 💙👣🍼
Them within 6 months! (may I add that I know what it's like and it really is hard cos it does fuck with your head so glad I got out)
All legal highs are dangerous, so kids if you are considering trying this drug. Don't. You'll end up addicted and struggling to come off
... To be getting worse n worse and more addictive with all the "new ones" they're bringing out. I mean legal lsd? It is some dangerous shit
... Stay away! I know from experience how hard it is to come off them but I had reasons to and bloody hell am I glad I did, they just seem..
... Selling it is cos it says "not for human consumption" on the packet. You don't even know what goes into them &amp; I strongly advice to...
Legal highs, should not be called legal highs. They're more addictive than any other drug out there and they're only getting away with...
My phone is slowly breaking. Cannot be fuckin arsed with that!!!

Stress after stress after stress. Don't fucking need this.
5 weeks until my due date 🙊 I hope to God he doesn't decide to keep me waiting any longer. I'm getting impatient 😔
My hair done! All I wanna do is treat MYSELF for a change. Okay, rant over.
Can't afford it aaarrgghhhh that's all our money gone on Wednesday and there is STILL things to buy and ANOTHER week where I can't get...
And the fact that my boyfriend has 3 kids from a previous relationship and they always get clothes EVERY easter gets to me...
Sorry but I don't agree with people buying their kids clothes for easter, it's fucking easter. It's all about the easter eggs. Not clothes
Could easily go back sleep 😴

Can't cope, so uncomfortable 😢
I need long hair 💁💆💇
Apparently I'm a cunt for not letting my boyfriends mate stay for a few days. Sorry but who's name is on the tenancy?
Can't wait for this pregnancy to be over.

Can't believe that my little munchkin is nearly 4 and half pounds already! 😱 and he's still got 7 weeks to grow!
It really gets to me how one woman can destroy your chances of being a family 💔
03:38am &amp; I am still lying here, wide eyed. Body is too tired but minds on one! Can't remember the last time I had a decent sleep 😴
Absolutely heartbroken, heads well and truly going and the only reason why it's not is cos of this baby that I am bringing into the world.
Can't wait for bed time 😴
Full fringe or no full fringe? #decisions

The downfall to living with your boyfriend is that when the football is on you don't have control over the TV I always have control 😢✋👊✊

Had the scariest few days thinking Harry was gonna make an appearance! Fortunately he is still cooking and it's just a water infection...
...deserve to be around his mum and dad who can't be together. Wow, I am actually experiencing real heartache for the first time 😭💔
There is actually nothing more painful than being in love with someone but having to let them go! It's for the best &amp; my unborn son doesn't
So jealous of every single person that has watched or who is going watching @thescript 😭
Can't stop crying. Such an emotional wreck.

... MAKING IT AS HOMELY AS POSSIBLE! Especially when there's people constantly coming in and out of the house.
Priorities? As my best friend I think you should understand that moving into a house, whilst pregnant is hardwork and IS A PRIORITY...
Why does the right side of my belly button feel tender but the rest of stomach doesn't? #pregnancyadviceplease?
Wish tommo would hurry up home 😔 he's only been gone for a couple of hours n I feel lost already
My new house is finally starting to feel like a home now 😊
GET TO SEE MY LITTLE BOY AGAIN ON FRIDAY 😍 CANT WAIT TO SEE HIM WIGGLING ABOUT 😘
