Favourite email trail so far: https://t.co/jo7ivfTgBG 2 Sony execs switching seats throughout golden globes because of an article…
Sony email leaks are a deep deep rabbit hole and I feel like a creep.
Excuse me while I froth all over the new star wars trailer
Why is mene so short? @brandnewrock
My pay this fortnight is about $500 more than it usually is 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Would @HilaryDuff host Saturday Night Live already? @HilaryNews
Just checked our internet usage and we used 30gb on Good Friday. Thank god for @Internode unmetered netflix.
Veep was better than Game of Thrones. There it is.
OMG, Orphan Black also starts this week. Oh man. This is living, you guys. This is living.
I am loving all the @HilaryDuff/hilary 2016/hilary for America jokes. And they will only get more frequent 👌
Forgot to bring moisturiser for after my swim. My face may fall off before I get home.
Just realised Aussie netflix doesn't have Max...?
On to my 5th movie of the day 👌
I miss Oscar season. Do I seriously need to wait 8 months for quality movies again?
Oh, also the lizard people were terrifying
Also, Cate Blanchett played the stepmother with gorgeous complexity.
Cinderella: 3/5. The tights the guys are wearing: 5/5.
Shock horror: there are loads of kids at imax for the 1pm screening of Cinderella. They all best shut the fuck up during the movie.
I am going to see Cinderella at a 1pm session during the school holidays. Do I have a death wish? Perhaps.

Modern kinder surprise toys are an absolute joke
Hooooly shit, check out this crazy dude https://t.co/T2DXWxA69C
I've never seen Mad Max because I always thought it was Razorback, that terrifying wild boar movie.
Captain Bellick is scum. #prisonbreakrewatch
So i think a power surge just fried our PS4. Fuck.
Where the Going Clear torrents at? This is The Jinx finale all over again!!
They should really just start election coverage at like 7-7:30. These peeps be struggling.
What approximate time do we estimate that voting will be quietest?
So, data retention... What do I have to do now?
The people who are saying Cate Blanchett was pissed off etc in that interview mustn't have seen a Cate Blanchett interview before
Is it just me or does Aus Netflix not auto-play the next episode? Very strange… it's making me sit through the credits on Mac and PS4.
Way too fucking early 🙈💤
Like, have these people really never texted their husband/wife before?
What's up with peoples' text message history always being empty in TV/movies?
The perfect representation of the differences between me and my sister. #fbf https://t.co/NMoj5C9OCI
Four nights in a row of drinking. I'm sure I'm breaking some kind of guidelines.
Does everyone else still absolutely hate everything their parents say and do?
As I clean my bathroom, I ask myself: does @HilaryDuff clean her own toilet? (I assume not)
We moved in about a year ago and we still have some things in boxes. That's normal, right?
Is there anything more disappointing than a pub running out of food? Running out of beer perhaps but this is a close second
Highly recommend Netflix's "My Own Man". Interesting look at fatherhood, manhood and masculinity.
19 pay days until we fly to New York. Uhhh... 💸🇺🇸✈️🗽
Netflix doco 'My Own Man' - a guy ponders masculinity and manhood after he learns he will father a son. Interesting so far.
Finally watched the last part of The Jinx. I can only imagine how mind blowing it was for people who didn't have it spoiled… wow.
Also, for something that is EVERYWHERE on the internet today in terms of news, there is a serious lack of The Jinx downloads…
FUCK. In my desperate search for Part 6 of The Jinx, I ended up reading spoilers. Motherfucker.
After you hear/see the HBO logo, what show's opening sequence does your brain expect?
My dad just sent me this. "No need to wipe down the kitchen bench" http://t.co/drNeT2uusx
OMG the last man on earth is absolutely brilliant @swineanddine
😍😍😍 @taylorswift13 http://t.co/Lebvu5qjI2
Just noticed that the Netflix app is ready to be downloaded on PS4!
Wait, is there no need to activate a new/replacement @CommBank card anymore? That seems a little… not secure.
Comparing one born every minute UK vs US is actually legitimately interesting.
Going to the pool after work at 9pm when I already went to the gym this morning http://t.co/IrdZH4lKoy
False alarm with reddit. It was just Internet issues. I am back up and redditing, thanks for the concern
OMFG they have blocked reddit at work.
Netflix unmetered with @Internode 🙌🙌🙌
Space grey apple watch sport: I'm coming for you
People who wear flippers while doing laps: you're kidding right?
Can Veep season 4 just start already
Me: *pretends to scroll through music like I'm not going to just put on 1989*
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is up on Netflix and I have tomorrow off work. GOODBYE WORLD
Why can't Cate Blanchett adopt ME?
Wait, they sell Havaianas at Big W now?
When did I last listen to something other than Taylor Swift? I do not know
Holy shit, swimming laps is legitimately so much harder than I remembered
