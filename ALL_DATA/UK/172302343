I literally need to go to New York for just one weekend so I can see Finding Neverland 😭
Bed time!
Car tunes 🚙 Jealous - Nick Jonas.
Wednesday's never fail me. #favouriteday
If someone could remove my larynx that would be awesome
😶🔫
It hurts to breathe. 😞
Way to kickstart my day 💪☀️@SpenceJoanne

My throat hurts so much - don't even know why
Of course my glands are up on the first day back 😔
And home.
Oh My God! This train is so quick!! 😭 thank you God.
On the brighter side of things... Have a great evening @heidi_delve and @PoppyMayAndrews performing at the Olivier's tonight
This diversion is ridiculous. I'm in fucking Aylesbury!
There is a Quidditch World Cup story... I can't believe what I just watched...
The @PippinMusical soundtrack is keeping me going on this journey. Still not in fucking London yet.
Someone somewhere really doesn't want me to get home.
Throwback to @vfestival 2 years ago w/ @DaRussell93 @SingingSwallow @aroomeyx http://t.co/XxTJOQ2JVc
This journey just got 10x worse. I have no headphones. 😭😭😭
The worst part about going home is just the journey. God give me strength and a large glass of wine. 🍷
I really want a bowler hat 😪
My beard is actually orange. Needs to go.
Bottles of prosecco behind the bar last night were £12. Obviously I bought 3.
I've only just remembered that @peter_keighley gave me absinthe last night. No wonder I feel like I've been drugged.
Why do I do this to myself
I feel like ass
This is actually happening 🔲🔳
I'm so excited and unbelievably terrified. 💇🙈
Haircut time 💇👑
Forever and always 🍸👏 http://t.co/u6k1JPTE1y
Eaten so much crackers and cheese
My phone is absolutely fucked.
Feels good drawing again
Can't wait to start swimming again #SummerTime #fitness
Can we all appreciate how awful @SingingSwallow 's attire was last night. http://t.co/OiW1CK1spl
Just devoured a packet of custard creams - sorry and thanks @PoppyMayAndrews
I think im going to start swimming again
Got my mum hooked on PLL 😂 she's sat her contemplating going to work because she wants to watch it with me haha
Spending my day watching Pretty Little Liars. 💜😈
Don't actually know what to do about my phone 😭
IVE SMASHED MY PHONE. IM SO UPSET!
This sun 🙌☀️
Today is possibly my favourite day!
😏 https://t.co/4tLBlzwkyK
I have a really bad feeling that I'm going to get drunk again tonight
script analysis is so long.
Princess Nellie has just woken up http://t.co/anh0w7JKnp
I don't know what I did last night - but I know it started with wine and ended in tequila.
And once again I'm up at 4am. My body is never going to recover
🔲🔳 https://t.co/FRsTnW51dS
Too much rosé. Where's the tequila?
That nap has caused so many different problems
Nap time 😴
I think I'm going to die
I'm not entirely sure I remember the last time I was seen outside in the sunlight.
I'm going to be sick
There were 3 in the bed and the little one said... WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SELFIES? http://t.co/bLwXCFqHgY
Dancing day 👯
2 bottles of wine later and I'm sat in my living room listening to a playlist of Jeremy Jordan - it's like a personal concert
Reunion which has been long overdue w/ @SingingSwallow
Dinner with this. It's good to be home. http://t.co/HaBKfgk1iI
Tiredness just hit me like a sack of shit
I can't wait to be a daddy 💙
This one is my favourite thing to come home to as he screams at me with the biggest grin on his face every time. 💙 http://t.co/UBOUY5sG34
This little lady is my everything 💜 http://t.co/lXfxwo7Tsr
My beautiful niece 💜 https://t.co/2n3FDKzsJm
There are so many disgusting people in this place...
I've so missed this place.
On the bright side of things I'm back in Devon.
So many grockles...
I'm more deranged than usual.
Not sure how much more of this car I can take.
Let's list all of my flaws no.1 http://t.co/JzGBjV1wFh
I'm such a moany  bitch when I'm tired 👿
I now understand why people get annoyed with me being needy.
Point proven - stick your tongue out at a 6 year old and she'll stop crying because she's in fact an attention seeking little bitch
I seriously have no patience with children that cry for no reason.
Starbucks for breakfast isn't really a dream for me.
Don't know why I decided it was ok to look at my bank account just then.
Those long car journeys in which all you desire is to stretch
Fuck.
How can you become so interested in someone you've never even spoken to?
I feel like I've forgotten how to sleep.
I'm so awake 😳
That person who knows all the right pressure points 😍
Like I want him to be my son
Personally I'm in love with the boy
I literally feel like it's Xmas. I want to go to bed early so I can wake up early to jump in the car to go home. #countdown
I'm so fucking excited to go home tomorrow!!!
I'm still so hungry...
I do love Duck Egg blue
Definitely only just realised that my dad has redecorated all of upstairs...
I won! Get in!
I'm losing Top Trumps to a 6 year old. 😒
We're now playing Hello Kitty top trumps. 😁
My little sister knows 'someone like you' by Adele word for word...not entirely in tune but it's a start.
It's literally getting worse and worse - do you people not have jobs?! Jesus.
Bank holiday rush hour is gross
Anyone want to come see The Last Five Years with me in London when it comes on for a week?
See I'm smiling, that means I'm happy that you're here...
Hey London Town 😘
Homeward bound - well halfway...but tomorrow!! The old green hills of Devonshire.
Today is going to be so much effort.
Maybe I should sell myself to a rich guy and make him fall in love with me..... Imagine.
My throat aches
You can't reject Richard Gere 😭😭 stupid bitch making me cry. You love each other goddammit, it doesn't matter that youre a hooker.
Need money. Anyone? No. Ok.
It's only because I'm watching Pretty Woman
I really want champagne right now
I have been here, all day. http://t.co/Nw2FQysKhk
That chinese was amazing. Do you know the best part? - there's more 😭
