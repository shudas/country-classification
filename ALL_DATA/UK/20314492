And the ad breaks are cutting in half way through sentences. Every. Single. #TheRoyals
...seriously, did kids write this? It's a shame because it's a great cast and setting.
Really getting fed up of the Americanisms in #TheRoyals. Cotton Candy, Making Out and now... Abolishments which isn't even a word?!

Had fun at rehearsals attempting to sing in French, in time and in tune. I'm sure it'll be alright on the night 😄
Sitting in traffic again 😒
...the ride. They were just about to go up that big vertical climb. I love that ride, but the thought of being trapped in my seat is horrid.
We were queuing for Saw when they announced that the ride was closing and they were waiting for engineers to come and free people from...
Dropped into Thorpe Park as the season tickets run out next month. It's still busy. Looks like the kids are still off school #wowsers
Popped into the brand new Miwk shop to say hi. Very cool and geeky shop. I recommend a visit!
I've got my top down 😱 http://t.co/aNWvxFw55n
Been stuck in traffic for ages. Bah.
Look left, look right, then cross #voteliberal #dontjudgeme
Off on a surprise outing with Boyf. It's too sunny to be cooped up writing today. http://t.co/vZ5yBo9CGM
Go away plant genitalia. My eyes are streaming!
Ok that was different. Good character piece I guess.
Watching Shame. It's quite good but it's very slow. Especially the Jazz club bit. Needs cranking up a few notches. I know it's arty, but hey
...gone for a walk to the canal instead http://t.co/sBVEzJJoLU
I was going to sit down and write today, but there's too much stuff going on in my head and it's too hot to be indoors so I have...
Well I was in the gym pool by myself today. It felt a bit Paradise Towers!
You know when you're watching a horror film and someone is swimming in a pool by themselves and you yell at the tv "Why are you doing that?"
Goodnight Earthlings
I can confirm that I'll be signing copies of my Scifi trilogy at Bolton Comic Con in November http://t.co/pxX4xIaVMG http://t.co/9NvzO9gvAE
I really enjoyed The Life and Loves of a She Devil so I thought I would give another of her books a try :-)
Little 'un has gone home. Time to chill with a book before rehearsals. Reading Darcy's Utopia by Faye Weldon.
Good gym sesh. It was amusing watching the instructors being trained on the power plate in the corner.
Just me then!
I can't watch this film sober as it's so fun. Does anyone else have films they like to drink to? The American Pie films are the same 4 me
Watching At World's End again. It's only been three weeks since we last watched it, but I want to spot all the locations we saw on Friday 😃
Quick gym sesh before a very late breakfast and now off to pick up little 'un to take her to our sunday rehearsals. #itsallgo
Catching up on Inside Number 9. It's one of my favourite programmes. Quality writing.
I did it! http://t.co/TwteL7sKBy
Morning world.
In our cosy hotel room now.  I have the hiccups 😞
Back at the hotel and ordered another pint. Get in! ;)
We made it! http://t.co/yGBQF1s4Tr
Ok so some of the pubs are cinemas / shops. Stopping for a subway before we get a taxi to "The World's End" or The Gardener's Arms. 😃
Been to the hotel to shower and change. Pub 5 is now a shop. Stop 6 is a Wetherspoon.  Cheers!
Pub 3. Waiting for food to arrive to break it up a bit!
Omg omg! Boyf's Easter surprise for me is the actual Worlds End pub crawl! I'm so excited! Squee! Currently on Pub 2.
We are going away for the day and the night but I have no idea where! #surprises
Just got up and broke my fast. Pitta bread and nutrigrain. Nom! Boyf picked me up from the pub last night. I think I was a bit tipsy 😣
Having a beer intown with @NickCard1977 😊
That moment when you bump into a friend who remarks on how nice your hair looks when you've just come out of the gym and it's all lank.
Morning tweeps. Last day with little 'un today. Trying to drag myself out of bed 😴
Rehearsal went well. Night night tweeps :-)
I'm worn out. Not sure I have the energy for rehearsals. Still, it'll be worth it.
More book 1s are on the way. Plenty of books 2 and 3 available. http://t.co/4xIlWJapMx #DoAliensReadScifi #WhenAliensPlayTrumps
Gym was really quiet today. Got lots to do today including an extra evening rehearsal for Tale.
Today I saw this. Cuteness overload. http://t.co/1zxeqmUs2R
Dieting is hard work at Easter. Eating a quarter of an egg a day is not easy. It's making me appreciate it more though I guess.
Off to rehearsals :-)
Had a great day in Warwick and at the Guide Dogs Breeding Centre. Learned lots and got to play with puppies!
So I was watching an episode of Comic Strip Presents last night and there was Peter Capaldi wearing a fez! http://t.co/VcgFAYQz6g
So it's winter again...
Up early as we are going on a day out to the Guide Dogs breeding centre. I can't wait! I'm going to want to bring one home, I know 😄
Anyway. Goodnight tweeps
I learned something tonight -men don't necessarily feel guilty after eating dessert.What kind of amazing paradise would that be eh? #jealous
Great gym sesh. I think I've almost earned a couple of hours in a beer garden ;)
Morning. My dreams were riddled with nightmares 😣 Going to run off some adrenaline at the gym 💪🏃
Shattered. This Easter bunny is going to bed. Goodnight earthlings x
#thebeaubunny #k9 #doctorwho http://t.co/K9mAI5VtK8
Doing some crafts with little 'un while Boyf cleans out the fish tank. I think I got the better end of the deal!

Happy Easter http://t.co/Nvh2aw6KGi
Some killjoy thief has stolen the first bag of eggs of our egg trail. How rude!
Happy Easter! http://t.co/PxOtuzdhE7
Goodnight tweeps. May all your chocolatey dreams come true x x
Tonight's film: Evolution. Not seen this in years. Cracking open the wine too. #nightin #happyeaster
Thunderbirds are Go!
Great gym session. And hardly anyone there! Lunchtime :-)
Time for the gym now. If it's not too busy.
That was pretty cool. *fist bump. Badeladeladeda*
30 mins of ads and trailers to sit through now 😑
They're playing Blink 182 All the small things. Tempted to get up and dance in the aisle haha 😄
Sitting in the cinema. Hope the little kids don't talk throughout the whole thing 😣
Omg it's freezing. No chance of a beer garden this weekend then 😡
They're showing Big Hero 6 for £2 or something so may as well.
Morning *yawns*, up and ready for Kids AM cinema. Glad I didn't have a drink last night.
Lovely dinner cooked by Boyf. Watching Red Dwarf while we wait for the Friday Soaps. #nightin
What's everyone up to today? We have been doing crafts, face painting, stickers and watching DW
Another day. Another PPI call. Get the message guys - missed call, Google number, block!
Morning world. First full day with little 'un for the holidays and it's raining. Rainy day activities it is then!
Tonight went well. Just got in. Shattered now!
Quick cuppa before going to rehearsals. Little 'un is coming with us to practice her part and meet the cast 😊
Or I might call my mum first. #procrastinating
Sorted. Line-learning time again. It would be easier if my French accent was more natural!
And now I have to do the housework so that's another hour and a half of sweating. I feel less guilty about last night's wine now 😄
Did half hour in the gym then an instructor, who only had 1 person in their class, rounded up me and another girl for a 55min aerobics class
Morning. Off t' gym.
It's been a long day. Well kinda. It's definitely wine and Doctor Who o'clock anyway 🍷🍷🍷👽👀
That's my screenplay sent off to @bbcwritersroom Now to spend the next few months with my fingers crossed!
2 hours in the gym then straight into Hotel Chocolat. But tbf I'm buying Easter goodies for gifts!
Off to rehearsals
Watching #TheRoyals. It's quite good apart from the American dialogue which falls flat for me.
Only 4 and a half weeks until my book signing at Dimension Jump. Come over and say hi :-)
http://t.co/4xIlWJapMx http://t.co/dFBND2KxrH
It's so windy, the chimney is making s right racket. Wind - ssssh already!
House of Fools was awesome last night. I'm glad they kept the bits in when Vic and Morgana were corpsing 😄
Right. Sitting down to write now. #amwriting #amprocrastinating
That was a challenge - running with the wind blowing the opposite direction. I could barely breathe. It was like skydiving all over again.
....trying to break in. I really freaked out at one point!
Dreading going outside in case the house has landed on the wicked witch Of the East. Seriously blowy last night. I thought someone was...
Tonight's film: Frozen. No, not that Frozen. This one... http://t.co/512goUdimn
Tickets available now! I have several roles in this fantastic Newbury Dramatic Society production. http://t.co/6WlaupWuMg
Right, I had better go and learn my lines for Tale. They're still firmly in the script and not remotely in my memory &gt;.&lt;
Maybe it's because I watched Mr Gatiss in Coalition last night, I am on a diet and craving ice cream and I miss @HAFFERTEE X-D
Last night I dreamed that I was in a film and I forgot my lines, Mark Gatiss kept kissing me on the head and @HAFFERTEE was eating ice cream
Just had my induction at BSTFitness. Can't wait until April. Bring it on! 💪
Had an idea for a screenplay. I want to get started but I would need to do a tonne of research. Hmm.
It's film time! Tonight, it's The Rules of Attraction. I've never seen it before.
Apologies if that tweet was worded weirdly but I was trying to be concise and I hope my point was evident.
Why don't soaps ever acknowledge bisexuality? Characters are deemed as "gay" or "turned gay / lesbian" Shame on you #EastEnders and #Corrie
For dinner I'm making tuna and sweetcorn toasted sarnies with bacon bits. #experimentalchef #eatinglikeastudent #lazysunday
Home and having lunch
Morning. *yawns*
Sleeping in my mate's lounge. Knowing their 3 kids are getting up at silly o' clock. Aaaaaaagh! Lols.
UK people. What's the actual time? 😭 been in the pub and can't remember if I set my phone or what and stuff 😢
Having fun so far :-) It's like me and my oldest mate have never been apart. Weird how that happens eh?
Watched three DW eps in a row. Killing time until I drive to MK to see my oldest pal for drinks. 31 years since we met!
Watching some DW to mark ten years since its return. Runaway Bride first :-)
I'm going to rebel and not put the clocks forward tonight.
Thanks for all the follow Fridays, tweeps. I'm overwhelmed!
Morning *yawns* zzzz
Brickleberry is nowhere near as funny as it looked in the trailer.
Fun night at the theatre with Boyf, little 'un and my friend. Despite my poorly throat. Ouchie.
Going for a bite to eat before the theatre.
Covonia throat sweets are like hugs in your mouth. Really comforting ☺️🍬
