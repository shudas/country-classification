Rachmaninov - Symphony No.1 in D minor Op. 13 https://t.co/EowF64YEQB Here is Mvt 4 of that failed symphony. What do you think? #RachChat
#RachChat That criticism threw Rachmaninov into a 3 yr funk when he did not compose anything. Later the blame fell on Alexander Glaznov
#RachChat #factoid Rachmaninov's First Symphony conducted by A.Glazinov  premièred b4 his 24th birthday was badly panned by the critics.
#RachChat #factoid: After a meeting at Steinway Hall in 1918 Rachmaninov and Horowitz established a lifelong mutual admiration. #RachChat
