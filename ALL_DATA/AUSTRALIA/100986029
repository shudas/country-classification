Luke 2 ~ Simeon was 'waiting for the consolation of Israel', Anna was 'waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem' #WaitingontheLord
...It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.
Lamentations 3:22-26
"The LORD is my portion" says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him."The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.
The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness...
And after all the waiting, we will kneel in adoration before the King, rejoicing in the fulfilment of His promises. #cmssummer
And in the midst of our waiting, the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies are new every morning. Amen. #cmssummer
Davies: Waiting is a part of the Christian experience, it is a characteristic of the godly life. #WaitingontheLord #cmssummer
