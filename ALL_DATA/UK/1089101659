Porcias in labour, going to have little kittens in our house soon
My face actually looks like a tomato, Why do I burn so easily
I want to know where I can get myself a minion
It'd be so cool if when you bought a new apple product you got to create your own emoji
Better get a lie in tomorrow
History prelim on Monday http://t.co/dAEUtpSxiS

Feel so shit all the time

Need to get more bath bombs
Probably going to fall asleep in the bath
I need sleep
Once upon a time is so good
In such an awful mood
Feel as if I'm second best to everyone, like no one wants me around, so shitty
Absolutely dreading school next week
The only good thing about the schools going back is that dancing starts back too

Wish I had got tickets for Nicki Minaj
I want curly hair so badly
Nah probably going to just end up getting a scuba diving costume instead of a bikini for going on holiday
I've had a brill week with some brilliant people

Nah I love the bee movie so much
I need a remote for my light, too lazy to get out of bed and turn it off
Eyes are so stingy
I get annoyed far too easily
As much as I have heard it  this week I still love listening and singing along to the frozen soundtrack
actually feel so sick
It's the holidaaaysss!
It was so nice to go to the cinema tonight after the Easter camp show
I cannot wait to sleep

My house is going to be like a zoo when porcia has her kittens
I can't believe I have a prelim on the first day back after the holidays, what is the point
I will probably spend the whole of next week sleeping
Nah we have had fun at heart #whosplateisthis
The frozen camp this week has made me so emotionally exhausted that I am sat crying at the bee movie, someone send help
I can barely keep my eyes open
In such an awful mood
I've been having more and more blonde moments lately
The bee movie is Brilliant
Rocking the cap and shades http://t.co/WEGKVDqMnv
I say actually waaaaay too much
I always watch people on dance mom's do acrobatic stuff thinking about how easy it looks and then I try it and realise it's not easy at all
I've probably been more stressed today than I ever have been at school
I will actually go and drag Adriana out her bed if she sleeps in again tomorrow
Ashley Benson finally got snapchat, my life is complete
I better have nice kids
Trying to watch despicable me but I  cannot keep my eyes open, never have I been so tired
I have the frozen soundtrack stuck in my head
Unbelievably tired
My eyes are so stingy
My ultimate life dream is to live in Los Angeles and have a career in dance
I am so tired
Have an obsession with irn bru right now
Wouldn't be surprised if I have sunburn after today
I need to start going to sleep later, waking up at this time in the holidays is ridiculous
Jealous of Adriana being in Paris right now
I feel so shit all the time
Every photo I get sent in the group chat saves onto my phone automatically, Brilliant
I can't get over how good the high schools rock challenge was
I Have enough rmps worksheets to write about five books
So done with today, need it to be over now
Life would be so much easier if I went to dancing for 6 hours a day and school for an hour each night
Today has been awful
Forever comparing myself to every other girl in arbroath
In the worst mood ever
This week has been awful
Painting my nails takes so much effort
It's weird because I don't feel too nervous/embarrassed when I do dance shows or anything but as soon as someone speaks to me I'm bright red
Actually feel like I am away to cry, can't do school
Feel like I'm away to fall apart, arms are so sore
My muscles are so sore
Hope today goes fast
Who needs April fools, my whole life is a joke
Unbelievably tired
Just realised it's April fools
In such an awful mood
Tonight was really good, love  performing with obedience
Ugh school tomorrow
Feel brutal
All the support we have been getting from other schools is amazing, so proud of our rock challenge team for their performance last night
Looking forward to performing at the J-Rock with my wee dance fam tonight ‚ù§‚ù§
I'm so emotional today
Can barely keep my eyes open
Got such a sore head
If my hair is still black I will not be Happy
Can't even express how I'm feeling right now
So tired
