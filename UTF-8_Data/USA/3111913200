"I say her vagine look like sleeve of wizard"
About to get to my buddies to play #MortalKombatX ...  been waiting for this shit.
So I got my preordered copy of MKX from amazon...  but no preorder code for Goro...  contacted amazon, and they are sending me a replacement
So Wolfenstein: The New Order is great, except this damn prison escape while piloting a mech...  damn slow reloading gettin me killed
I could go on..

Ya know, its really cool to be told how much of a dick u r by someone who cant stop interrupting you...  fml
Wolfenstein: The New Order is a LOT of fun.  A sotry driven action filled honest FPS...  Love it.

Playing thru Injustice Gods Among Us, story mode. The voice acting, the story...  damn.  Good stuff.

Wow @redbox dropped a funny 4-1 joke...  introducing Petbox
"You cant take life too seriously, you are already living it."
Perhaps its time for me to switch from Mortal Kombat 9 to CoD:AW. Story mode is gettin boring.
I kno its a old game, but man the online lobbys in Mortal Kombat are empty...  figured the new one would bting pkayers out to warm up.  damn
