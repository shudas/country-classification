How on earth is the @penguins logo wearing gloves
It would suck to be elimated on a cooking show by a guy nicknamed 'chili dog'
"Sticks" is a good name for a gangster beaver
Apparently it's playoff season for anthem singers too

So our 7th annual Andrew Hilliar Memorial charity poker tournament apparently raised about $1425 for Roger's House. Good stuff!
TV advertisers apparently decided long ago that the only effective way to advertise chicken is to throw it in the air in slo-mo
This weekend I managed to lose a game of rock paper scissors to a guy that had both hands full and could therefore only make rock
Who'd have thought that a charity poker tournament partially funded by a brewery could leave me so hung over

The band name of the day is "The Lesser Baldwins"
Nothing says 1980's like a girl in a miniskirt playing a saxophone
Krokus is probably the best metal band named after a flower

Gotta love England's unnecessary affectation of playing soccer with a pink ball in winter even though there is never any snow on the ground
I typoed crazy as "craxt" and now I'm thinking of just permanently going with that
Good luck to all the golfers trying to win clothes this weekend

If you stick your hand in a pony's mouth, you're a fuckin idiot. I learned this the hard way
Kilts are like "I hate pants, also I want to wear a flag'
Watching junior hockey is fun, it's like "hey I remember being 17 and dumb as bricks"
I'm admittedly biased but this is still the best jersey in hockey http://t.co/Fysu5qc2vc
This just seems like a poorly thought out plan
There's this weird theme in the Indiana Jones movies: Villains who believe in God and want to do evil things to meet him
Happy Easter to the dude drinking beer on the bus at 11:30 in the morning http://t.co/xe6ivgNxtG
Just saw a guy asking for directions in front of the methadone clinic. "Well, you go down this dark alley and just wait there for 5 minutes"

I never realized how much I hated Notre Dame until I rooted against them versus an undefeated Kentucky team

I bet no one calls them clownfish to their face
I'm at the opera for the Marriage of Figaro. It opens with three minutes of you thinking you're at a live production of Trading Places

First of all, Sims are not "moving out". They're simply having their homes destroyed in a planned series of disasters

"Okay I'll kill those people."

Kind of hard to believe that the word "Spaniard" isn't derogatory
Hamburglar is cool but next week I'd like to see a @Senators player get the far less flattering nickname "McNugget"

Sports reddit is awesome, except for r/soccer which is full of assholes
If you like watching white boys hit threes then you could do a lot worse than this Butler-Notre Dame game
We might as well let McDonald's just buy the team at this point
Why do athletes wear yellow mouth guards, it's gross
Kinda disappointed that @MapleLeafs fans didn't dress up for tonight's game as Grimace

If Barcelona wanted to save some bucks, they should put me in goal. I'd play for $50 and it would have no effect whatsoever on their results

I see Buffalo is buffaling, as per usual
Why do Monaco have jersey sponsors? They should just have Prince Albert's face on there instead
Just saw Bono in the stands at Monaco v Arsenal. Where else but Monte Carlo would the biggest Irish band in history be on St. Patty's day
No Eastern European name sounds more like a dessert than "Timofei"
