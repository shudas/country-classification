Low key want you.
When I saw you, I fell in love, and you smiled, because you knew.
She will be loved, she will be loved 🌸

You'll never learn, but thankfully, I have.
People who follow the crowd usually get lost in it.
You know, if you needed someone at 4am Id be there for you, 

And I know if I needed someone, you'd never be there for me.
