Happiness is never stopping to think if you are.
I owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice, and then going away and doing the exact opposite

The theory of everything
https://t.co/uwN4wgckE5
proof that there is no justice in this world: Better Call Saul exists, but there was never an Omar and Brother Mouzone spinoff from The Wire
Of course the first day I ride into work is also the first day it has rained in 3+ weeks.
You might be in San Francisco if: yr having trouble dealing with all the cool tech startups which are just cute names for alienated labour

People always tell me omg you're so weird( but it's a good thing ) like ok no I'm not I just do the things you subconsciously think about
It's so funny when someone thinks you're ACTUALLY interested
Ion really hate anyone but people be annoying so I just flirt there annoyingness away
Like I even flirt with people I fucking hate
I flirt with everyone, not intentionally or anything but just because I don't know how to not flirt
Can't flirt with myself so you'll have to suffice.

Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
You're no good for me 
But baby I want you.
We both know just what we're here for
cuz everyone's a pussy
I just need someone who likes horror movies as much as I do.
hidden artists among us
we dont even have to pretend that we know what it is were looking for.
That's why I feel like bras are a waste of money, like did cave women wear them? I bet not
I don't like people who aren't open with there sexuality, like we fucking lived in caves naked before bitch get out of your comfort zone
Any female that likes that shit is fucking lying, no female wants to cry with you right now blud
Niggas be deep stroking they insecurities out
That's the last thing on my mind at a time like that &amp; I'm on a mission here
Like if you're getting it on with a chick don't get emotional and start asking all these questions, about if I love you and etc.
I absolutely hate being bothered with questions like that
Baby did you die?
Like I been in a relationship forever iono how to act
cuz have no idea
Does anyone know how to date
I don't even know how to arm the place

OHH YEAH BABY TALK GENDER EQUALITY TO ME
Falling in love is so stressful and scary and mentally straining idk how people do it
I lost a tac in my bed earlier today &amp; didn't try to find it &amp; I currently really hate my past self bc now I'm laying in bed afraid to move
There's no greater feeling than unexpectedly finding the last Popsicle in the back of the freezer
I just asked Lex a question &amp; all she said was "Idk I just really want milk" then got up &amp; got milk &amp; still hasn't answered my question
I'm sorry was that too corny

Don't trust atoms
They make up everything
I'm never drinking a coffee at 10 pm again
The writers of big hero 6 are not my friends
Nothing like salmonella poisoning to spice up my Tuesday
I've been home for 5 minutes and my dad is talking about how he used to have a stunt turtle named nemo #homesweethome
Oh look you're still an asshole
That point in the day when you have to choose between taking a "quick" nap or having another cup of coffee
That could be my tombstone
I'll sleep when I have nothing else to say
Leme get this fresh 6hrs in
Okay I'm leaving marvyns room and going to sleep
You ever feel like you don't bring anything to the friend/relationship?
And then you try to share the experience and they're just not interested in a "tried it, didn't like it" kinda way?
Have you ever had someone close to you experience something with someone else that you wouldve likes to experience with them
#Dreamville Where everything is as what it seems and our shirts fit perfectly
Tyler's Bastard intro comes into play right now
Not that I think about stuff like that...... 
I just have these random curiosities
"Here lies Dan. He Met the World and tried to leave it a better place than what he arrived in."
Today I came up with idea of what my future headstone WI say:
... zZz... Stay silly my friends
But enough about me
And im not hiding behind that "I'm human" shit I'm just simply mean that ive done pathetic shit while knowing better somewhere inside
But I won't lie. 
I've gotten too deeply lost  in my life to make better moral decisions
Im human
Looking at me and hearing about the shit I've done would be disheartening
You guys don't know of my villainy
I myself have done some heinous shit.
*people
I, like a lot of people I know, have been desensitized to pee and the heinous things that they're capable of
Shit, it's a major deal if you can make me feel anything in general
Nobody intimidates me. So it's a major deal if you do
I think its cool because I respect the shit out of them and admire their abilities
There's a couple people at the shop I work at that intimidate me
I'm grateful but reality is a buttmunch
Now I'm here
It's devastating because as much as I didn't know how much control I has over it. I thought I could control it better than I did
A couple years I fucked off something that I knew would be great
Envy and Vanity go together so well
It sucks to be me sometimes. Often. But I'm sure that the same goes for you sometimes. If not then good for you! You're dope
I'm gonna be honest I had a tiny piece of a piece of chocolate tonight. That's all I'll say
Being born great is shit. And if that was the case then simply being great doesn't solidify your greatness
I swear my best work is done btwn the hours of 12a-5a
When it's quiet and reasonable
Where all of it comes rushing in and bulging and loudly intersecting and interjecting and keeping you up because what better time than now
My least favorite and cherished time of each day
And then it's the night time thoughts....
While making to do what you're supposed to do: eat. Clean. Take care of whatever business you have going on
Then it's relevant thoughts. 
Fck am I doing tomorrow then the day after that? The fck do I Want to do? The fck Should I do?
And then it's the think about what just happened during the make/build part of your day and how hopefully tomorrow is better. Different
Then it's make/build a living where a majority of us wish we were doing something else somewhere else
From wake up its *I'm up, now I gotta clean my shit and put clothes on and feed and then be on my way to make/build a living
I'm not talking bout plain ass worry free. Even rich/wealthy and zenned the fuck out/spiritually in tune people worry about shit
I'd give away a vital organ to be sincerely worry free
Thinking forward. Backward. Left. Right then left of right would have happened. Then backward if right would have happened and so on
All day with this shit
Being alive with a mind that includes logic is so tedious
It's crazy how insignificantly significant breathing is while still being the most significant thing to your life
I'm going inside. Walking had better not kill my vibe
Use this simple CSS tool that requires more infrastructure than your wildest C++ projects.

It was 8:19 like half an hour ago.
I just wanted to play GTA but I'm just gonna switch to TV lmao oh well
I fucking dropped my controller but I don't feel like getting out of bed.

I think my dumb ass stepdad caused a fire in here but I don't care enough to check.
Last night I tried to parallel park &amp; failed miserably. I also became delusional &amp; kept seeing someone hiding in the back seat.
I just had to walk to work because I remembered that the buses got rerouted &amp; now idk where the fuck they go.
OH MY GOD
This lady at the bus stop laughs like a witch oh my god
This bus driver is not taking a break right now oh my god

I'm young so I push it to the limit.
I'm just sad it never worked out.
When yo barber schedule you for the time you want &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I look like my parents don't love me by the head. Where is my barber?
I had like 2 bananas &amp; a muffin this morning. That's it. I'm fucking starving.
I'm really in love with the coco. Stay hydrated.
Today's timing is like perfect. I love it.
I got so much respect for the greats in this music shit. I mean the ppl we'll never forget.
Fuck work. Always getting into my hoop time.
Not really in the mood for anything today.
If I got it then you got it brodie.
Getting comfortable with being uncomfortable.
Ballin all day with my bros.
Alright to sleep I go. Listening to Living Room Flow by Jhene Aiko. I gotta put in more work from now on. Goodnight ppl.
I don't wanna sit at home. I gotta get where I'm going. https://t.co/lbLygkXldP
I wonder where those girls went.
3rd best Saturday I've had.
Bruh I'm fucking done with this show. This shit is trash.
I'm up watching American Crime. This show is annoying. I'm more frustrated than entertained.
I've been doing this wrong. I've been here for too long.
When I'm serious, yall cattin. When I'm cattin, yall serious.
That new Jhene really go.
Way way way in the aves. It would really suck living over here.
I be on the go.
I gotta get stronger. Muscles on muscles type shit.
I hate getting upset over lil shit. Man fuck that shit.
