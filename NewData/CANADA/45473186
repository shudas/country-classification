I keep forgetting younger people are still in school...then I get confused when I see them at school.
Can we talk about how in only a matter of days I'll be holding the fat thing that is my cat? #soexcited #iwantmycat
I stayed up all night because I started a puzzle and couldn't see any of my clocks, so I just kept going. Gotta love uni life.
