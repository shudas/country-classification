my shift consisted of me helping out a milf with fake boobs try on bathing suits and dresses so I'd say that's a win for Stephen

Easter dinner in Scottsdale ☺️
clearly Beth is tryna fatten me up #HappyEaster http://t.co/2RfEExen24
a group of girls came into Abercrombie tonight and said they go to UofA and they were all beat and smelt like egg salad so I was happy
chocolate chip cookies from paradise bakery are heaven sent
this 9 hour shift today will be the death of me 💀
cool Alyssa can stop sending me snaps of her in my bed like I know it's the best bed in the world but get out my room hoe
I love how @laaaurencl and @taytayalexander always walk me home after a long night of partying 😘
I think today is one of those days that people are just trying to piss me off
tbh I wish I got the whole "hey you need a 6 pack to attend asu" memo before I came here bc I'm sick of being the fattest person everywhere
I wanna have like a fun Easter dinner with my friends and drink champagne and stuff
all I wanna do is drink by the pool with my friends 😔
pretty sure Danielle's family would rather have me going to Colorado instead of her but sorry Luna fam, homeboy has to work 😔🔫
"@emilymorrow_: I eat sushi way too often but it's whatever"
the things I would do to Megan Fox 😍

it's only 1 o'clock and I already worked a 5 hour shift...I should start waking up early more often! #Productive
on my way to work and listening to the talk shows on the radio...is this what it feels like to be a divorced dad?
yay for having to be up to go back to Abercrombie in about 7 hours 😊😊😊😊
I started with $1000 M&amp;G this year and now I only have $65 left 😩 what did I spend that shit on?

I have work in a half hour but I'm still drunk 🆘
a security guard found my wallet at panda like of course my fatass was so excited for my food I forgot to grab my belongings
dude no fucking way I lost my wallet....back to fashion square I go 😒
this woman just told me that the next time she comes to Abercrombie she expects to see me in the pictures around the store ugh ily babe
I love the people that I work with on Saturdays they're all so fun ☺️
I hope this shift flies by
had my first visitors at work tonight, thanks for stopping by @vluccs @K8Burnzz 😘
I should be at ultra rn not getting ready to go into work
the highlight of my day was walking through vista and hearing @fiielding scream UNCLE STEVE in front of everyone &amp; being so happy to see me
damn honestly have never been this stressed out on my life 😔
I can never say no when my managers ask me to stay and work late
