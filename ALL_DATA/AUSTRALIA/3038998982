I cannot wait for the Rockets-Mavs series. Got 7 games written all over it 🏀
People slating the Sixers and @JoelEmbiid but didn't they score out of of the timeout!? http://t.co/mvV73EZqAH
Anthony Davis player efficiency rating is ridiculous 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🌏💤💤💤
So ashamed of the world we live in, no one should go out with friends and never make it home. RIP Karen Buckley
Last day of camp tomorrow 😢
I checked in to Spurs 41 vs Pelicans 60 (2nd - 1:24) on SportsYapper. http://t.co/xGeafXSlDa #Spurs #Pelicans
Let's go NO #TakeFlight
So impressed with Porto. Still unbeaten in the CL. Only team left with that record.
It's unthinkable to sell any of these. Lewis Cook especially but all 4 are going to be massive players in the future http://t.co/45du5ADKoS
Absolutely quality 80 min session with my U16's. High tempo, 4v4's, playing through the opposition, touch and play.
After 4 straight Finals appearances the Heat are missing the playoffs for the first time in 7 years. Pacers or Nets will take the 8th spot
🙏🏽 http://t.co/P2ptrO7Vdr
Quality 1:1 GK Session this morning
Lovely autumn morning in the Eastern Suburbs
Did my LinkedIn email reach you last night @TonyWalmsley ⚽️
Massive win for Stevenage up into the playoff positions now 👌🏼
If we sell any of these I'll be finished with the current regime #LUFC http://t.co/wTwm7qLk9a
Norwich are going up
At least we are giving it a go #EveryCloud #LUFC
John Ruddy is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Massive goal at The Den. What has happened to Wigan 🙈
Had to be him
We're teetering here. How Norwich aren't leading is a myth
I checked in to Leeds United 0 vs Norwich City 0 (49m) on SportsYapper. http://t.co/xGeafXSlDa #LUFC #NCFC
I checked in to Atletico Madrid 0 vs Real Madrid 0 (55:47) on SportsYapper. http://t.co/xGeafXSlDa #AtletiFCB #HalaMadrid

Planning tomorrow nights session for my U16s. 
Playing out from the back and getting the ball into wide areas✏️📒
Looking forward to @GordonRamsay Costa Del Nightmares later. The man creases me up
My first football memory other than Italia'90 or Leeds "Gascoigne Strikes" what a goal 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥 https://t.co/Iz90xBB8GI
Bit of Foot Golf today with my group. The children were buzzing off it ⚽️⛳️
Looking forward to 'Sole Man' @30for30 this Sunday. Their doco's are first class. Hooked from the first second. Brilliant 👏🏻
Need a performance at ER, Norwich are a top side and will fancy themselves. Keep a close eye on Bellusci and Cameron Jerome
Off to @benandjerrys #FreeConeDay 🍦
Quality day at Soccer Camp today. Home now to plan for my first 1:1 GK session tomorrow.
That finish though 😂👌🏼⚽️ http://t.co/pWrWs3mKya

New plasma sorted for the flat 💯👌🏼

I checked in to Swansea City vs Everton on SportsYapper. http://t.co/xGeafXSlDa #swans #EFC
Great win for the Mariners. Worked hard when I was there and they are a great set of lads. @TonyWalmsley deserves a chance next season.
Brilliant afternoon at the Blue Mountains @ScenicWorldAust. A place of sheer beauty 💯👌
9,548 is a good turnout in Gosford.
You can see why Ferreira was at Chelsea when he was a teen. Will be such a force in this league next season for Central Coast.
Big second half ahead. Fancy the Mariners to get another on the break. Need to keep getting it wide.
Great first 45 @CCMariners. Full of purpose and creativity. Nice and compact without the ball. Doing a good job thus far 👏
That ball from Ferreira was on the money. Begging for a touch
Grand National Bet Done 🏇🏇🏇🏇
Cernak and Ferreira looking lively
Beautiful night for football in Gosford.
Great start by the Mariners. Straight off the training ground that one 👏
Such a cool finish from @josh_rose3. The boy will be happy. Lucky Mascot? 💯👏
👏 John Hutchinson
💯👏 @LUFC 💛💙 http://t.co/DuPUfqS6Yz
All the best to the @CCMariners tonight and to John Hutchinson in his last home game. 3 points 🙏
Back in Sydney. Fish'n'chips for tea 👌

Macca's brekky on route to the Blue Mountains
Bit of @ALeague before bed. Glory vs Sydney FC. Sydney lethal away from home.
What a try to win the game 💯👏
Absolutely love Golden Point @NRL
What a finish to the Roosters Broncos
Dinner was spot on👌
Best thing about @TGIFridaysAust over our English counterparts is that the restaurants are bigger and you get seated straight away 💯👌
TGI Fridays' for dinner tonight 💯👌
Great 2 days at @CCMariners , an awful lot learnt &amp; met some top people. Many thanks to @KitMankatte &amp; @TonyWalmsley. Best of luck tomorrow
Perfect view from the dug-out http://t.co/caP34KM0Cf

Warm-up drills set up outside the Mariners Stadium. 👀⚽️ http://t.co/74xoybrxJD
First team in watching video analysis. Warm-up out the front then light session out on the pitch. Possession and tactical SSG's
Evaluating today's session and a bit of FM2015 💯👌⚽️⚽️ http://t.co/wAQ3WFIIKC
RIP Stephanie Scott. Absolutely awful. Hope they lock the scumbag school cleaner up for life.
At the hotel and it's absolutely freezing. Wrapped up in bed with Micky Flanagan on the laptop 👌
