WHY IS EVERYONE SHOUTING ABOUY DISNEY MOVIES WHAT IS GOING ON
do you really think somebody's gonna look at a pic of someone &amp; go "wow you look v intelligent/compassionate/multi-talented today damn girl"
what the hell I can't even breathe
four years and not one day without drama NOT ONE DAY I SWEAR
you go on and on about how you love the cast so much but god forbid one of them say that raura has a bro/sis bond
it is okay to disagree with Raini (just like it is okay for her to disagree with a "raura romance") but some of you are being jerks
everyone blows everything out of proportion sigh
also @ people who think Calum didn't say they have a brother-sister bond and that raini is the only one http://t.co/x8CQFVgUl4
do not hate on raini for what she said

d o  n o t  h a t e  o n  r a i n i 

dO NOT HATE ON RAINI 

D  O  N O T  H A T E  O N  R A I N I
