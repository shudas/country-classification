Rhianon Robert Walsh...
feeling in a time where all things seem at peace a collective convergence of the quiet... Dreaming you are so light you could fly...
Tied the sinews , tendons, muscles and bone, the journey weighed by the human experience, joys and loss , it is what defines us...

When in memory we may forget  , those few whom for a while on this earth taught fundamental aspects of the "Truth", Where we may fight...
We strive for understanding, a collective logic tainted ... We struggle believing certain truths ... Tested, renewed, reborn ...
We live in complicated times, We struggle with the turmoil, wrought with pain,We struggle  with complicated sensibilities ..
If I just disappeared,I dont think anyone would actually notice,Distant wife, detached,non engaged friends Thoughts of leaving this realm...
