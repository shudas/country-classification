Start picking Pink Ladies and the weather turns cold and wet, what a feckin surprise! #shit
lol 2 seconds more and Hawks won that!
Considering how shit we have been if we had put away the clear chances we have had it would be all tied up.
Traveling Brisbane fans are enjoying themselves, pity they are so daft  and there chants boring as batshit.
Good to see gumby make some changes and go for it.
Hmm that was a bit shit. Team looked good for 10 mins, all Brisbane since. Need a miracle from here.
Hahahahaha hahahaha hahaha hahaha hahahaha hahaha Hahahahaha hahaha Hahahahaha #MVCvNEW
Decent enough way to start the season  by the crow boys.
lol, basically the AFL is saying "you are probably drug cheats but they can't prove it so fuck it". #Essendon
Coulda ..... shoulda. ........ #auvmv
The  irony of victory fans singing "your not singing any more " when they have been church mice most of the game.
You at the game today @thekingofswing?
Tactical genius there from arnie on the sideline! #SYDvMCY
Nice dive Janko. #SYDvMCY
Hey @davidFranzwine are you still chasing Golden Delicious? I am getting a few bins of juice grade now.
PISSED DOWN for 3 seconds :/ #moreplease
Massive congrats to @elrich11 , hugely deserved.  Been outstanding this season.
Look what time of the year it is @allaboutcider :) http://t.co/lnz4utntxS
be nice if GT can lock it up and smash into the back of SvG who then takes out Courtney taking them all out of the race :) #Clipsal500
Hey @tensporttv any chance of mentioning @mwinterbottom ? Looks to be doing a decent job!
that was complete shit by @AdelaideUnited and tbh the coach got a lot wrong. Shocking night for the club.
lol, haven't lost to the top team all year and yet lost to flog teams like NJ, CCM and MC, fkn ridiculous .
ffs. No center backs and Marrone still wanders off leaving a paddock on the right for players to put it on Kennedy's head.
How the fuck is that not a yellow?
lol this game was decided before the players took the pitch. #ADLvWSW
Wrong decision that #CWC15 No way that should be given out. Embarrassing way to win.
If @CCMariners  passed in front of its attacking players they would be a lot more effective!
I can't believe I'm saying this but bloody good job bro @andyflave76 . #amazing http://t.co/JihaU3uyPX
Frank Lowy looks very old.
i'm smiling. #AUSvKOR
Child has now been renamed Banjo Massimo Tomi James Flavell.

Someone has burnt their tea in North adelaide tonight. http://t.co/rHXIhOIxyw
So the baby decided today was the day enter the world. At this stage he's been named Banjo but that could change depending on tonight :)
