Okay so who's going to remind me to do my TAXEs
(That would be a scream, but I don't want to get over you.)
Or I could make a career of being blue, I could dress in black and read Camus. Smoke clove cigarettes n drink vermouth like I was 17.
I can't decide whether I love or hate the fact that two of my exes made the same obscure stupid joke on instagram hmmmm
one day my wardrobe will hold no fitted clothing, only strange blankets of varying size

I have a lot of feelings rn
Go outside and look at the moon. The Moon is so fucking beautiful.
Psst... @tricksonme... I've had 4 requests for another Fall Down Boy show...
In other news, I finally figured out how to put on bronzer.

mood: unfulfilled
I am literally too #blessed to be #stressed

I gotta pocket gotta pocket full of vitamins
Now that I am back in my cat-infested home, I hear the return of my charming wheeze-laugh (death rattle) hhhhhaha

"There's just like- a beer in the shower." @lushnessrumpus #yvr2k15 #slumming
burned the living shit out of my finger just in time for #YVR2k15
about me: when I was a child my favourite scented crayons were Dirt and Fir Tree
And the crowning glory in this possible Best Weekend Ever, I found incense that smells like a campfire. I can die happy.
I'm not getting over #BEARS anytime soon. I feel like Sheldon Elter drove a Ford F150 over my heart. In a good way.
Soul all shook up after seeing #BEARS from @Pyretic_Prod 
Heartrending, hilarious, hopeful. Down with pipelines, UP THE BEARS.
I remember last night when @jolemadin came in through the front door I yelled "MY VALENTINE" and ran at him
Also any time last night's phone-wielders (I c u) wanna surface footage of Fall Down Boy's maiden voyage, that would be cool!
#YVR2k15 tomorrow. I am living my actual dreams lately. @lushnessrumpus @studabomb
IF MY FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SELF COULD SEE ME NOW
also there was a super cute person right near the front during our set last night and I got v flustered by eye contact SOS
And then you all scream Sugar We're Going Down and I think it was a liminal experience bcos I'm hella transformed anyway
I mean the feeling of being in a tiny house with a ton of people who are just happy to see you and willing to share their cigarettes
wow last night was fuckin cool
"Moof and Dill and who's this asshole." #chesshousecats
