Watching Top Gear with the flat mates and feeling chilled as ken. This is what flats are aw about 👍😊
Oaft, yesterday's left my back feeling like I've been hit by a bus, Christ help.
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we've got. Everything I went through, you were standing by my side.
I need to start learning how to like folk. Cannae just be spending time with aw the usuals.

But people are so fucking annoying. 
#Decisions
Vin Diesel though. What a guy. 💪💪💪💪
Going for a bounce with Wally 😁❤ #AirSpace
Watching Wally boy do Bring Sally Up and I'm acc thinking what a perfect piece ✋
Acc just feel like bursting into tears, fs
I am the omelette master. I'm also a pretty fucking gid flat mate. 👍 http://t.co/qNIH6XNQ6Y
Buzzin oot ma diddlies to have an early birthday date tomorrow for Wally boy.

Old man.
Is it okay to have Cascada on full in this day and age?

Clearly having some form of breakdown.
I actually don't think there's anything more annoying than a clever person acting like a dense fucker.
Go out with the intention of getting a salad, come home with everything ranging from a birthday balloon to washing detergent but no salad.
The Fast and Furious films seriously just make me want to become a criminal. 🔫💰
Fast 5, biatches.
Had the most horrible dream and woke up bloody greeting, fuck my life.
I am not mentally, or physically, prepared for a 9am lecture on Property Law.

University is not okay.
#LawStudentProblems
If you dance on a pole, it don't make you a hoe.

Usher knows the deal.
Jesus Christ, Paul Walker's beautiful.
Watching #Fast4 and feeling like a winner.

Ride or Die.
Also, where the fuck has the sun gone.
I need a Mcintosh or a Wallace in my life right now to be a spooning buddy. 

Not feeling it today, bros.
The temptation to draw cocks all over Dexter's playing cards is overwhelming.
Stood in the IT bit of uni, waiting to print over 100 bits of paper. 

How's your Monday going.
#Cut4Queen
In bed watching #FastAndFurious with Stuart. I'm winning at life.
I desperately need my bed and for either Rowena or Stuart to magically appear beside me in it.

Today's a write off.
He's so hungover, it's hilarious. ❤ http://t.co/l8c60Eprfi
Don't really know how to feel about buying over £180 worth of drink just for tonight.

Would dad be proud or disgusted? #firstworldproblems
42 Days until I leave.. I don't think I like that.
The fact that exams are in a month yet I've not studied at all and one of my notepads is empty at week 9 could be potentially problematic.
Tom Hiddleston on Top Gear will always be one of my favourite things to have happened, the man is a dreamboat.
Surely it can't just be me that absolutely loves Richard Hammond, what an absolute hero. 😎
Almost embarrassing how badly I beat Stuart.

SUCKER. http://t.co/pujSg5Nr0V
Not to be a massive cock but foreign customer advisers should not be offering me advice when they barely understand it themselves.#HELPME
Not seen the maw in 6 years &amp; the 1st photo I see of her, she's wearing dungarees. 

Aphrodite, you never were a great mam. This proves it.
As if I'm tipsied oot ma tatties at ten past three in the afternoon lol. http://t.co/7NtuhfjMO0
Let it be the weekend already so I cause a riot in Paisley taaaaaaaaan.

@mcintoshrowena Halloween pt. 2.
Never mind the fact that it's my birthday tomorrow, HOW ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH AM I FUCKING 20 NEXT YEAR.
As if @mcintoshrowena is sending me nudes OF OTHER PEOPLE.
I've not smoked since bloody Friday and after having to babysit these two over the past few days, you could say they're defos testing me.
It's not even funny how badly I want to get fucked in the sun right now but I've nae ceunto to drink with in Glencoe. WHY DO I HATE PEOPLE.
It's 20 past two and I'm showing no signs of being tired, despite having to wake up for nine to babysit.

This is less than ideal.
Ride or die.
When your darling father realises that his eldest daughter's birthday is NOT a month away but IS actually in 2 days. 

Suck a lemon, Edward.
Eventually, I'll ask someone if what they're saying is a euphemism and when that glorious person says yes, I will ride them 'till dawn.
When Stuart says "I need my neck stroked", I know fine well he means a neck massage yet I can't help but ask if it's a euphemism anyway.
Don't spend your time looking around for something you want that can't be found. 🐻

#BareNecessities
Listening to David Attenborough describe how crocodiles have sex at 1am in less than ideal. 

Bed time.
I think I have a genuinely weird fascination with sharks. If a program doesn't have at least one episode involving sharks, it's worthless.
Seeing Glencoe in #Skyfall always makes me proud to come from this beautiful place. http://t.co/z78AqZX3DJ
I can quite honestly say that I would probably give up one of my best pals to marry Daniel Craig, what a beautiful human ❤ LOVE ME, FFS. 😭
Buzzing out my diddlies to get bloody RAT ARSED with @mcintoshrowena and Stuart in a few days - it's about time my two shag eye's met again👯
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?

#LostStars
There's just something about the way Scottish male singers do their thing. Love it. #StevieMcCrorie
I need a massage, my back's gubbed.
Acc need a car so bad. Being a bus wanker is just not okay when it's hot and crowded.
Fact that it's such a nice day makes me not want to go home ☀☀☀
Currently blasting out some Will Young and I'm not even embarrassed.
Actual think meeting Stuart has been the best part about this year at uni - what a wonderful piece. 

#GayTweet #NotEvenSorry
Its so cold that every pair of tits I've seen are covered in goosebumps. 

#baltic
Just watched the new #FastFurious7 - absolutely amazing. #RIPPaulWalker 🏆❤
Absolutely insulting amount of sleep and having to be in a Business Law lecture that starts at nine is not okay.
When Stuart starts sending me videos of Monkeys playing with Tigers, I start to re-evaluate our whole relationship. .
Oh well that was awkward. 

I need to start censoring my conversations.
I think @doyouevenken is literally the only person in halls that I haven't been angry at yet.

Medal goes to you, Vitty Boy.
Currently blasting out some Westlife and I don't even give a bother, nothing can go wrong right now.
The more I think about it, the more I realise how annoying my pals are.

Who signs other people up to become ordained as ministers?! Fs.
FUCK my inner lotus and eternal damnation, FUCK YOU @dexoholic . http://t.co/rm9I0Ym17L
If you're not living on the edge then you're taking up too much space.
Surely it can't just be me that thinks Jordan from Scrubs is a total milf. http://t.co/HUJ7STjOM5
I'm an absolute hero. Case study done meaning freedom :D

But for now, bed time fs
Not to spark a debate here but seeing as I'm doing a case study on it 
- Abortion: For or Against?
#Abortion #roevwade
Aw nuh, shouldn't have gone for that sleep earlier on, wide awake and it's quarter to six fs

#FuckedIt
Halfway through this bloody essay, geez a holla
Ten minutes in to April Fools day and I've already been made to look like a twat by Dexter lol. My friend's are mean.
Aw I want/need in my life right now is Stuart to spoon and rub ma sore heed while I take a 5 hour long nap.

Life's pleasures. #SimpleThings
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have fucked up a little.
Blasting out Maroon 5 on Spotify so we've got all the works playing and I am loving life.

Levine makes life better in general.
I don't care if the majority of you hunt me down for saying this but I will happily get slayed for letting you all know I love Nickelback.
How do people not get this? I thought it was about the company that you kept, whether it be your boyf, besto or fam ✋ http://t.co/pLJKqEIo8o
By living in a flat opposite the entrance of a multistory carpark, I now understand where the stereotype for female drivers has come from ✋
It must be so hard for all you little liars to keep track of which stories you have and haven't told 😂💁
