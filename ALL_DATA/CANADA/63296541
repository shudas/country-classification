.@ottawacity what are you going to do about people speeding down Bronson Abe &amp; other busy streets &amp; soaking pedestrians on the sidewalks?
I really wanted to stand outside and be soaking wet when it's -10 outside. That is 100% my goal.
Shout out to the asshole on Bronson that just soaked me while I was waiting for the bus. You are the absolute worst kind of person.
I have exactly zero patience for people who are late. Or their excuses.
I'm disgruntled I had to leave early so I'm streaming the game from the bus #goravensgo http://t.co/6uwBODGKuN
I have never wanted to go to BC more than I do for @squamishfest this summer.
Hearing Sens fans cheer olé like your club is so embarrassing you can't even get your own cheers? #goodbye

"Spezza plays for Dallas." God bless you heckler.
I've seen exactly 10 sens fans since coming to CTC. Some of them have drums and are still quiet. #goodbye
