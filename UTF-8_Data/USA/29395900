I just yelled "THERE'S A NEW STAR WARS TRAILER!" louder than I yelled at most Beavs games this season
Why did nobody tell me about #SWCA in advance?!?!? I NEED TO BE CAMPING THERE RIGHT NOW!
When you realize that you agreed to babysit the same night Suds is having a @HopValley promo night! 😖 #ImTooPoorToGoAnyways
sorry but New Orleans loves it's sports teams more than any other city. Really cool to see Davis appreciate that  https://t.co/DhuNm0Zn3o
cue the millions of people who claim to have cared about the NBA all season......HAHAHA give me a freaking break #basics
I remember getting laughed at for saying The Pelicans would make the playoffs this year.....well would you look at that #AD #TakeFlight
really wish I was in Portland this week to take part in all the #CBC2015 festivities
if Saints draft Mariota instead of literally any other position (DEFENSE?) I'm out. Even Drew can't fix that release https://t.co/fMm2Eg0kOR
When people ask me why I love animals so much I'm going to direct them to this tweet. My dad rocks #GooseWhisper http://t.co/cPhmRvUhKV
My favorite part of watching @SportsCenter now is the musical chairs of ditzy female "anchors"
Nothing like a giant bowl of fresh Honey Nut Cheerios 🐝🐝🐝
Sliding on your knees after scoring a goal is one of the coolest celebrations in sports
Just a nice little photo opp before the greatest concert of all time #ThunderRollsTuesdays @ Heaven… https://t.co/nXc1VYc0zO
THAT being said....I really cannot handle a guy that might be a total idiot on a Saints D that needs a lot of work. This draft is stressful
I for one would love to see the Saints draft some tough defensive players with attitude. Randy Gregory fits into that pretty well #90sWhoDat
I will never get sick of watching this. Guess those special Nikes weren't fast enough  https://t.co/X8iwBMNVcP
Didn't know how to react to a dude asking me if we sold pickled eggs. Sorry we're not a hipster friendly establishment
A sandwich a day keeps the bikini away
How am I just now learning that Vince Gilligan was a writer on The X-Files?!? AND that he wrote some of the best episodes?! #RockStar
Cleaning up a little kids barf before noon  is just another example of why everyone needs to work in the service industry at some point
James Marsden in The Notebook 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let's all just take a moment to appreciate that Sandra Bullock dated Ryan Gosling. And not just any Gosling.....The Notebook Ryan Gosling
John Snow 2016
"The freedom to make my own mistakes is all I've ever wanted..."
I need a recap of that Game of Thrones recap. I thought the episode would never start
And so it begins.......can't wait for more "story lines" like this #girls #DramaGate #WhoDatGonBePassiveAggressive  https://t.co/bxcgHiwQWs
"It's the roar of the Sunday crowd...." #TwoEncores #LifeChanging #GARTH @ Moda Center at the Rose… https://t.co/2nrqFiExb2
Greatest concert I will ever witness hands down
If I had a dollar for every Coors Light hat I've seen today I would be a billionaire
Thanks to Jordan Spieth's grandpa I'm now bawling my eyes out #adorable
Diggin this menu 🍻🌊🔥 #HappyBirthdayAmber #DrinkinPDX @ Burnside Brewing Co https://t.co/Y6z2r1TflG
Waiting outside a restaurant for brunch is the most Portland hipster thing I've ever done #ROOST
But I'm just a native Louisianian. So I don't know anything about oyster bars
Hey @EaTOysterBar y'all should put on your website that you can make reservations a day ahead. Didn't need that sass on a Sunday morning
I AM SEEING GARTH BROOKS TONIGHT!
Beavers baseball
Gotta love meeting random people from Corvallis at a hotel bar in Portland
Apparently there's a dentist convention at this hotel. Too bad Tim Whatley isn't here
I mean if you're trying to make fun of Obama I just don't get having a hitch cover that looks like his head.....haha so odd
Just saw a bro with an Obama hitch cover &amp; I'm confused A)that was probably made in China &amp; B)aren't hitches usually strong/reliable #ironic
I think people don't fully understand the craziness within the Nebraska football fan base. These people would fill a stadium in -10 weather
Can't wait to hear bozo writers compare the population of Corvallis to how many people were at the #Huskers spring game #ObservationsRock
Props to @FoodNetwork for cycling reruns of #TripleD, I watch this show A LOT and it's rare that I watch one I've already seen
Cheers #GoBeavs fans.......
If I was a Duck fan I would admit we had that game handed to us. Too bad they all think they hit great tonight/made good plays #delusional
Oh the joys of baseball........ #GoBeavs
This drive home is way better getting to catch some @Beaver_Baseball with @MEPOSU! Let's finish this boys #GoBeavs
"her name is Katy, spelled like Katy Perry"-@The_Real_Bob "I don't know how to spell Katy Perry"-@MarkYlen......hahaha classic #AlmostFamous
too bad @epsn is eating this up with a silver spoon! probably have a war room dedicated to how Hawks will get past all this adversity #barf
I'm already sick of all this Seattle drama and it's only Apirl. Biggest group of sorority girls in the league. "no....he's overrated!"
Shook hands with @waynetinkle today and talked a little basketball. So that was a pretty solid start to the weekend #GoBeavs
I think tonight was the universe telling me that when I crave a bean &amp; cheese burrito I should just go home &amp; have a piece of toast instead
#ChoppedCanada isn't even cheering me up. After a productive positive week I have to do something stupid like that. I'm a #DumbAss too Tiger
Like sometimes I blow myself away for how stupid I can be
Had my last tank Jeep for over 7 years &amp; never got a scratch on it. Tonight I make a stupid turn in the Rivas parking lot &amp; ding up my car 😖
Weird Al coming to Britt in September.......hey @MindofKVD better not let @dev_elisabeth go #GroupieFever hahaha
https://t.co/KQXUJxETpz if someone wanted to buy me this as an early birthday present that would be great
Tulip farms are to spring as pumpkin patches is to fall #BasicBitchAnalogies
Whenever I complain about getting my eyebrows waxed I think about childbirth and laugh
One reason why I love watching Tiger play is he talks to himself in third person. George Costanza would be proud #DumbAss
Hahaha "we should get all of our best athletes to just play soccer too" I would pay money to see LeBron attempt this https://t.co/aAo8SgDiqS
Party Down might be the most underrated comedy of all time. Also good luck tomorrow @mradamscott #jokes
Laura Dern going absolutely insane during the last 20 minutes of Jurassic Park is some of the greatest acting of all time
This is what happens when you look back at old photos on your phone #GoBeavs #MedfordNights #Royals http://t.co/0VJswDPT7m
Par 3 champ 👏👏👏👏 #par3contest  https://t.co/5oGBE2m99E
No disrespect to other hot older men out there but David Duchovny is the ultimate DILF 🔥
Wait for real.....Barry Manilow is gay?
Well that was one of the coolest sports moments I've ever witnessed live #GoldenBear
Lindsey Vonn missed the memo about the wind. Damn girl you can't be out there in a sun dress with no underwear on! 😂😭😂 #par3contest
Obviously Goodell is the one selling a Saints SB Ring online. His little pea brain hates New Orleans more than natural sunlight #WhoDat
Happy #LOSTDay!!! I'm debating if I want to buy a lottery ticket today........
