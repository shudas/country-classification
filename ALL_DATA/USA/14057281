Great tip...actually one of my #PetPeeve issues! #SocialMedia  https://t.co/qp6831QCYc
Story heard today: Couple comes home after trip to find squirrel in house, dead, its head stuck in a jar of Splenda. Say no more. #toxic
So into what you're doing @meghanlinsey #GirlCrush
I love the rain and hail outside with the candles and fire inside. One of my favorite things. #Portland
Exactly! Yet this is what happens so terribly often. #getrealchat #nointernsplease https://t.co/NnEFoRAvQW
Digital marketing often gets handed off to the new graduate, who has no base in fundamentals of the marketing process. #getrealchat
So many marketers, digital included, have no plan to follow and wing it daily. Not a chance they'll achieve meaningful results. #getrealchat
Social Media also suffers from the "my nephew can do it" syndrome. It must be treated as a key element in the marketing mix. #getrealchat
Biggest challenge of social media is constantly evolving and changing landscape &amp; opportunity. Also its biggest benefit. #getrealchat
Astounded at how many clients say "everyone" is their ideal client. Not a chance it's true &amp; totally dilutes marketing. #getrealchat
