Fuck you, Gone Girl. I am emotionally scarred. #spookybitch
Just watched a mad documentary about Scientology with @StefanC__. Decided I'm away to join the Sea Org.
Served a woman in work earlier who told me I couldn't scan the items she was buying because she was "allergic to the scanner."

What a beautiful day to be stuck in work!
"Canny get a minutes peace on here" said the troll bus driver, as she appeared 17 minutes late. I'm sorry, did I inconvenience you at all?
The bus I get to Wishaw at night is always either 5 minutes early, or 20 minutes late. I don't know which I loathe more.
Thank you @ScotRail, it's always nice to be squashed in amongst people on your trains. Not like I wanted any room to breathe or anything.
I can tell already that working right next door to @LushBuchananSt is going to be bad for my bank balance.

I am too excited to see @ENTERSHIKARI today and tomorrow. It's been far too long!
I feel like this has become some sort of tradition. üòòüíï http://t.co/S4m94Hv0E4
"He's a mink. I hope he dies in a fire with his maw." True entertainment is being provided by neds on our bus to Manchester. Silly patter.
Preston bus station is still the worlds most depressing looking place it would seem.
Top boyfriend award goes to @StefanC__ for picking me up after a long day at work and buying me pizza. #realhumanbeing #andarealhero

I wish I could make some sort of career out of bashing cunts in GTA Online. Seems to be my greatest skill in life.
Incredible. RT @ENTERSHIKARI: it's #TheMindsweepTour video #2 http://t.co/NXR0N8Ecti #Myopia
Just got mine and @StefanC__'s wee scumbag up to rank 100 in GTA Online. Life required.
If anybody happens to have a spare ticket for @EnterShikari in the Barrowlands please hit up me or @KieranJMcL. :)

And Slipknot are cunts. As expected. Salty as the sea.
Correction: Slipknot and Korn. And the fire alarm went off. Tonight is the funniest already.

Slipknot are sitting behind us in Hard Rock. Lmfao.
