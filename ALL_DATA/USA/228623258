Today was already a great day and I've only been up 55 minutes... I found 95 dollars in a pair of work shorts I haven't worn in months
Goerge Hill said I'm going to the Playoffs.
I think cuz I'm dehydrated every time I get out
I keep half blunts for me in the car for the ride home.... and man these half blunts get your boy lifted

Honestly, idk why I was in such a rush to get out of work... I think it's becuz I was looking foward to this chick fil a I'm about to get ✊
"@JAveryISO: I need some chic-fil-a and a large blunt. Only thing that can recover my day." Man I been thinking this all day at work
