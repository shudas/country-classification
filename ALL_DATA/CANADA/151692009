Things happen, that's all they ever do.
Very loving friendships http://t.co/6QQAHyEYXq
I enjoy kissing your face and touching your butt. 🌀
I dunno man. There's just something about blasting @TheFrontBottoms with your windows down, driving around. I have the feelies.
You've got everything going for you, so I'll go for you with everything I've got.
My fav day of the week.. Hump day 🍑
Couple at the gym making out - FALL BACK. You look ridiculous.
It's a god damn shame. I'm the pawn and you're the rook, and you played me like a crook.
I'm excited
There are so many rad things happening to me in the next four months
I don't think I'd be able to call my guy "daddy", but then sometimes I think I could. And that truly scares me.
OVERRRR IT BRO. over it.
I need a mental health year in Hawaii, then I should be good to go.
I will remember your face, cause I am still in love with that place. When the stars are the only things we share, will you be there?
Probably going to wear it anyways because who has time to get dressed more than once in a day.. Not I.
I hate when you plan an outfit in your head and it looks so fucking good and then you put it on and you look like a fucking tool.
I get to spend the next week with Ozzy and I'm pretty happy about it. 🐶
Re-watching The Office was probably the best decision I've had today.
Drown me in red curry and then throw some coconut rice on top of me. #sexting
Aubrey cried for me. We're on a real level.
iCunt
Spent $80 at the gift shop in the Telus World of Science and I regret nothing.
Part 2. http://t.co/qOE5f7c6n1
That escalated quickly for you, Trav. http://t.co/MImY47WlLf
My friends think/make me sound like a slut (@StephJerrica), but I seriously get zero dick. So there's that.
Am I the only person who re-watches my favorite Friends episodes? Chandler just gets me.
Is it weird that I'm missing Fort Mac a little?????
Aubrey just said "holla homie" .... She's not even two. Oh man, I love this child.
my shit http://t.co/iDYDPb2GzW
I remember your hands at my throat, a sweet reminder how you'll never let go.
http://t.co/fxeYHIegfu
The breeze coming in my window right now is so nice. Goodnight moon, and goodnight you. 🌙
I spent this year as a ghost and I'm not sure where home is anymore.
If you get off on how many guys message you in a day I probably want to punch you in the twat
This time tomorrow I'll be driving to Edmonton 🚗💕
If there is one phrase I'm tired of men dropping, it's, "You're intimidating."
And I am a grown ass woman, ain't no babies around here
I just cannot handle pet names at all
I'm sorry but if I had a boyfriend (lol ya right) and he called me baby or baby girl I would probably consider breaking up with him
Go to take a quick nap and sleep for three hours... EVERY TIME.
It's so close to being sundress weather. Ugh I can't wait to not wear pants
Can't believe I'm considering getting rid of my red hair.......
Volunteering with the Canadian Cancer Society is probably the best thing I've done so far this year. 💛
Smelly feet forever 💘
FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK, USE YOUR GOD DAMN SIGNAL LIGHT.
Mmmmmm freshiis just won my stomach/heart over. 💕
I'm so tired. I just tried to unlock Nikki's car while I was inside with my car keys.
"You bitter angsty bitch" me in a nutshell
I seriously need a pug. Not want, NEEEEEEDDDDD.
I am a dirty sock
I call you a gentleman but I'm so easy to love when I'm down on my knees.
Too many damn windows in this house.
Neighbour just saw me naked, no big. Cool. Yup. Can't wait to see him tomorrow.
Fuck. I am just so happy all of the god damn time and I love it.
Craving someones mouth is some real fucking shit that I am not prepared to deal with right now.
Introverts don't get lonely if we don't socialize with a lot of people, but we do if we don't have intimate interactions on a regular basis.
#AmericanCandy and #Kintsugi on repeat allllll day. Stoked about these albums.
"Rotted. Dttc" - Kirk Critch, 2015

Ugh I love @themaine
Just bought #AmericanCandy 🍬🍭 @themaine
My legs are sore but my hair smells really good and I'm watching supernatural. What I'm saying is.. Who wants to cuddle my butt/rub my legs?
And in case you were wondering, you are like a sunset to me. You're all kinds of beautiful as you end my day.
Would you like to leave this human race, tonight? Eternity will never be enough for me and eternally we'll live our infallible loveeeeee
Listening to the spill canvas makes me a depressed piece of crap but I cannot stop and the memories are flooding back and HELP
Me everyday http://t.co/Y7N1G59wdt
It's a four day work week, and yet I'm going to be working six days this week. The trips will be worth it.
Going to the grocery store stoned is probably my favorite pastime.
As if, as if, as if.. BLACK ME OUT.
Planning things for the future makes me so happy. The world is your oyster.
"All my friends are gay. .. Sometimes I wish I was gay."
My super religious pop starts laughing at me. What is life right now. Hahaha
I'm not proud of myself for the things I've done just to feel a little love.
It's not even 2:30 and I've already went to the gym, viewed an apartment, cooked salmon and cleaned out my car. Nap time pls. 😴
First drive in my VW since December. I am the happiest human today. 🚗💕 #droishome
Got super baked and started watching a documentary about the boogie man. I instantly regret this decision.
Hahaha remember Akon
we'll drink coffee till the evening just to pass the time till we know that they're asleep and I know that you're all mine.
"You got a job to support your weed addiction"
"Yeah, that's responsible"
People who talk about theirselves constantly are the fucking worst.
And when you do meet the person who makes your cells dance, you will be sure of it, because you are sure of yourself. #bealone
Thank Gandalf it's Friday
ilu @billytalentband http://t.co/QoeZoAo9gR
His hands are in my hair. His clothes are in my room. #familiar
Burned the roof of my mouth yesterday and now it hurts to drink my coffee. Why me?

Drown me in coconut oil
ADAM AND HANNAH FOREVER GOD DAMMIT

"Some people feel like they dont deserve love. They walk away quietly into empty spaces trying to close the gaps to the past." #IntoTheWild
A is my dick #PLLFinale #idgaf
I want to feel you, I mean the real you, I'm under your skin like I want to be you.

How much oragel is too much oragel? Cause I'm pretty sure I'm a oragel junkie right now
Lets talk about your hair - @HaveMercyMD on repeat FOREVER
Need a little sweetness in my life
I want a fucking donut
Lets talk about your hair and how it's grown and how we know that we're not getting anywhere.
Sometimes the best thing you can hope for is having someone to understand the poetry of your quietness.
I have it in writing. Yes I'm a fuggin sook for my nanna http://t.co/mMJESfzpyU
Fuck this episode of Supernatural is about clowns. 😩🙈😒
Wisdom teeth for the win.
Your lack of beer knowledge turns me off.
"I am so uncool" - @Kaitlyn_MD
So the countdown is on. Prepare your liver, @nicole_hiscock. Double trouble will be back on George Street. 👯❤️
My heart is so big that I can't help but offer anyone that comes along a place to stay in it.
Same. http://t.co/JDQWsNLYvK
I got the raddest compliment today  - "I like that you're just a human."
I am so close to booking a plane ticket to St. John's just for a weekend it's not even funny anymore, I miss my friends :(
What is my life
Is it Friday yet? I need the weekend and to drink beer to celebrate @StephJerrica's birth.
I missed this. http://t.co/wYS0YJlp2o
She was like a starry night, like a ferris wheel, full of blue-green eyes. And a heart of steel, always on her own.
http://t.co/G0U0bT47mW
I talk to asshats.
Is this real life? Do people actually love theirselves that much? http://t.co/v0wl9ExXRJ
Time to eat pancakes and catch up on @girlsHBO 😻 @lenadunham makes everything better.
Sorry ladies, he's Liam Neeson. (TAKEN) @WorkaholicsCC
Just ordered my first @Herschelsupply backpack 😍
Just ate Fat Burger for the first time. What a bad, bad idea.
“Any guy that doesn’t completely worship the naked body of a woman he’s into anyway is an asshole. Or a teenager.”
I hate how sensitive some people are. Yes it's ok to be soft but Jesus Christ, get a fucking backbone.
Tired eyes and a freckled nose forever.
Yes I like working out but if your idea of asking me on a date is to "train together" I will knock your stupid fitfam face in.
Aubrey had a sucker for the first time today. It made all of her dreams come true. http://t.co/QUCupWxcge
At the doctors office and so far a kid accidentally kicked me and an older man accidentally touched my butt. I'm too tired for this shit.
It's satisfying, so satisfying to learn things could move deeper but you'd never let them. You're all dried up.
Just finished Gilmore Girls and my heart hurts. I miss my Lorelais already http://t.co/UjjVkBPv63
