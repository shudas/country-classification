Raps don't get to 50, but finish year by setting a franchise record with 49 wins. Bring on the playoffs! Bring on Jurassic Park! #WeTheNorth
50 wins now out of reach for the #Raptors. Heartbreaking. #RTZ
Just met a fellow @Colts fan in a #gpab Subway. The horseshoe has support in northwest Alberta! #ColtsNation #NFL
Incredible finish! The quest for 50 wins continues #RTZ #Raptors
James Johnson channeling his inner @dennisrodman. Lovin' the hair. Big time props #Legend #RTZ #WeTheNorth
Great performance from the rooks today. Can't complain with an #OpeningDay win against the #Yankees. #LetsGoBlueJays
Another season of #BlueJays baseball is underway. Get set for some major ups and downs #bluejays2015 #OpeningDay
Just went to McDonald's. Cadbury Creme Egg McFlurry's are sold out. #EasterRuined
What a game between Canada and USA. Came up short, but not for a lack of fight #CanadavsUS #WomensWorlds
Rack it up! #Raptors clinch 2nd Atlantic Division title in a row, and 3rd in franchise history. Much better tonight, back to Raps bball #RTZ
One full year in Grande Prairie, Alberta and one full year @Q99News. Time really does fly! #gpab #Alberta @Q99liveFM
#Raptors clinch 2nd consecutive playoff berth! Awesome and bitter at same time. Team play has been non-existent of late #PlayoffPush #RTZ
Tune in to @Q99liveFM Morning Show tomorrow at 8am for 'sports movie' trivia with myself @DHTLogan @dhtFred and @PaulQ99 #dominate #gpab
Terrific team play leads to #Raptors 4th quarter comeback - only to be deflated on possibly most selfish play of season by Lou Williams #RTZ
The face of Canada basketball is calling it a career. Thank you @SteveNash for changing the way Canadians view the game. #Legend #NBA
Thanks #IowaState. My bracket has already been busted. #UAB #UABvsISU #MarchMadness
The madness has begun! What a finish to #NotreDame and #Northeastern. What a wonderful time of year. #NCAATournament #MarchMadness
It's been a frustrating decade for the #Leafs, but the next few years are going to be even more frustrating. Cycle of hopelessness. #NHL
Need to fill out a last minute bracket. Who's got a pool going?! #MarchMadness #FinalFour #LetTheMadnessBegin
Sad day for the @OHLBulls. Some great times and a terrific experience covering them as an @LoyalistSportsJ student. Such a shame #OHL #CHL
One of the greatest to ever wear the horseshoe, and one of all-time greats to play WR. Thanks for the memories, Reggie. #ColtsNation #NFL
Solid win for @GPWolves men's bball tonight. They hold on for an 87-80 victory over @CUCA_Athletics #gpab #ACAC http://t.co/LDZ1QMEFmC
Back to my roots! I'll have the call tonight at 8pm @Eastlink TV for @ACAC_Sport men's bball action. @GPWolves welcome @CUCA_Athletics #gpab
#Leafs trade Clarkson, #Jays sign Johan Santana. Must have missed the memo that it's backwards day #KillMeNow
It's been a busy weekend. #gp2015 #gpab #countyofgp #q99live @SpecialOAlberta http://t.co/kybRpwpKBq
Note to Pete D'Alessandro and Sam Hinkie - this is real life basketball, not a video game. Cannot win without continuity. #NBATradeDeadline
One of the best days of the year. #NBATradeDeadline. #Sixers making noise already.
Big thanks to @jamiemclennan29 for taking time to talk hockey with myself and @DHTLogan. Super cool dude. #NHL http://t.co/WjUITItxXW
Hopping the booth tonight with @Colton_Wiens calling #NWJHL hockey on @FASTHockey. Puck drops in 5 between @NavsHockey &amp; @SexsmithVipers
So @TorontoArgos are playing "home opener" in Fort McMurray. Little strange, but I'll be there. #gpab #GoBoatmen @CFL
Had the opportunity to interview @RachelNotley today. Here's an article that I wrote about it.. http://t.co/WHqUzdh4bO #gpab #q99live
Taking in some @GPStorm hockey on a snowy night in #gpab. Storm are flat tonight. Getting thumped by @sgsaints #AJHL http://t.co/yYZCYjWi4G
Moving to northwest Alberta thinking I would be ok with a 4-cylinder sedan was a battle destined to be lost. #gpab #fail
Least. Enjoyable. Super Bowl. Ever. I am so, so bitter. Next year #ColtsNation, next year. #DeflateGate
New Junior B hockey club could be on their way to Grande Prairie. My brief article from the other day.. http://t.co/YvLGEinQIH #gpab #NWJHL
It's tough to speak up. #BeIlLetsTalk
Raps are back. Great effort on both ends of the floor tonight. #RTZ #WeTheNorth #NBA
#Pacers broadcast team talking up #Raptors. Good. But just said Lou Williams was acquired via FA and pronounced Ujiri as Jiri. Ugh. #RTZ
Wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, just throwin' it out there.

Keep it classy New England. #DeflateGate http://t.co/sKY4DMHZsj
I hate you, Tom Brady. Great season for the Horseshoe. #ColtsNation
So many nerves, but I believe! Let's go #Colts. #BelieveInBlue #INDvsNE
#BelieveInBlue
Can't muster a single goal in SoCal. Things looking grim for #LeafsNation. #TMLtalk
Kyle Lowry making a bid to join the Shiny Dime Club. That man IS an all-star #NBABallot #RTZ
Bring on the Brady Bunch! http://t.co/DHXNRs506Y #COLTSTRONG
O-line and D getting the job done. Couldn't ask for a better opening half #INDvsDEN #GoColts
Comin' for the Brady Bunch! #boom #ColtsNation #ColtsvsBroncos
I might be 4,500 km's from home, but one thing doesn't change.

GO CANADA GO! #HereWeGo #OurGame
23 seconds. Wow. #HereWeGo #GoCanadaGo
It may have been -48 in #gpab today, but #TeamCanada advanced and so did the #Colts. I can't complain. #HereWeGo #ColtStrong
Bring on the #Broncos! #ColtsNation #GoColts #PeytonVsLuck
Adam Vinatieri still getting it done. #boomstick #CINvsIND
COLTS COLTS COLTS COLTS, WOOOOO!! #PlayoffTime #ColtsNation @IvanWestra
Wow, RIP Stuart Scott. One of the greatest the sports biz has ever seen.

"Don't give up. Don't ever give up."

Last time #Raptors played in Oakland they blew largest lead in franchise history. Spurred Rudy Gay trade talks. Thanks #GoldenStateWarriors!
Pure class from Canadian fans at the ACC. Standing ovation for Denmark. On to the semis. #CANvsDEN #WJC2015 #GoCanadaGo
"Let's go #Raptors" chants drowning out the Moda Center in Portland. This is fun. #WeTheNorth
Let's go Canada!! #SpenglerCup #GoCanadaGo
An #NCAA football program hands a coach $48 mil and it's a homecoming party. A player gets a free tattoo and is suspended. Disgusting.
Andrew Luck breaks Peyton Manning's franchise single-season passing yards record on 80 yard reception by Reggie. Holy. #Colts
Canada wins in the #SpenglerCup and #WorldJuniors! #OurGame #Pride #WeTheNorth @HockeyCanada
Happy holidays and a healthy New Year to all my twitterverse friends and family #BetterLateThanNever
#Leafs win, #Raptors win, #Colts win AND clinch their division. 

Today was a good day. #Sports
Kobe.
Another AFC South division title for the #Colts. Wasn't even close! #ColtsNation #NFL
Should've started Hoyer! #Browns #NFL #sawthiscoming
Working before the sun comes up the morning after a staff Xmas party is not ideal. #RonBurgundyNewsHour #Fail @Q99liveFM
The @Raptors beat @SacramentoKings 117-109, @MapleLeafs beat @DallasStars 5-3. Life is good in Toronto sports. #NBA #NHL #ThankYouSeguin
And that's why linesman/other on-ice officials should NOT break up fights. Almost glad Holzer popped that ref in the jug. #OutOfTheWay #NHL
Lou $$$$ Williams. #RTZ #Raptors #WeTheNorth
C'mon guys, this is brutal! It's like watching Jacksonville play themselves. #GetItTogether #Colts #NFL
So much for Bruno being "2 years away from being 2 years away". #RTZ #RaptorsvsBucks
The #Raptors are up 101-57 on #MilwaukeeBucks after 3 quarters. Bruno Caboclo making #NBA debut. #awesomeness #RTZ
Wow, these #Raptors mean business. #RTZ #WeTheNorth #NorthernUprising
$82 mil and the #Jays didn't even address a positional need. Wow. #brutal #MLBFreeAgency
Doing the PA tonight for the @GPStorm. They hold on for a 3-2 win over @CalgaryMustangs #gpab #AJHL http://t.co/kYBt8v3Qe6
Very cool moment tonight at the ACC for the late Pat Burns. It's about damn time that man was inducted. #HHOF #NHL
Stuffing a bus full of toys and other goodies today for the less fortunate come Christmas! #gpab @Q99liveFM @Q99News http://t.co/7LELCdcFk1
A long day of work and snow shovelling, but am now taking a moment to be thankful for those who have fought for my freedom #LestWeForget
KYLE LOWRY. #MVP #WeTheNorth
First week all season I bench Asiata and Hurns on my dynasty team, and they combine for 5 TD's. FML. #FantasyFootballProblems
Looking good on the tube this morning @RobSnoekLIVE. Have @cbcsports fired up over here in the newsroom!
If you're coming to my house tonight you better like Rockets, because that's what you're getting! #HappyHalloween
On the hunt for a fantasy basketball league! Where are you? #NBA #FantasyBasketball
Folks who despised #RobFord shenanigans are in for a reality check. Let's see how that city runs with a red flag capitalist. #TOpoli #Idiots
Well done #Leafs, #Habs and #Sens. That was one hell of a tribute #CanadaStrong
Greg Stiemsma wins #Raptors final roster spot. Will Cherry/Jordan Hamilton waived. Ready for tip-off! #WeTheNorth #NBA #NorthernUprising
The #Padres were 60-1 when leading after 6 innings this year. Mind blown. #MLB @cantpredictball
Thanks @PaulQ99 for helping a guy without a voice communicate. I sound like a deflated hot air balloon #RadioProblems http://t.co/FsIOarkptQ
Phil The Thrill! #LeafsNation #PlanTheParade
Matt Asiata or Benny Cunningham as my RB2 this week? (Yes I do realize I'm not working with much) #FantasyFootballProblems #FantasyFootball
Doing some PA announcing for @GP_Kings vs Dawson Creek Junior Canucks. Enjoying the action up close! #gpab #NWJHL http://t.co/Hzes5OoEFs
24-0 Colts after the 1st quarter. FEEL IT. #ColtsNation #ColtsvsTexans #TNF
Pat McAfee reminding everyone he's awesome. #Colts up big. Life is good. #Boomstick #INDvsHOU #TNF
Garth Snow executed 2 solid trades today. I'm speechless. #ThatsAFirst #Islanders #NHL
I realize he had AP (on beastmode) in the backfield, but Ponder led this team to a 10-6 record in 2012. This is brutal. #WhatHappened #NFL
Magic. #Royals #ALWildCard #sports
Excited to be the new voice of @GPStorm hockey on @Eastlink TV in Grande Prairie! #gpab #AJHL
We NEED temporary foreign workers. Figure it out. #gpab #cdnpoli #abpoli
Only thing worse than the #BlueJays  failing to make the postseason is the fact they are bringing back Buck &amp; Pat for another 5 years. #Fail
#Bills lose, #Colts win, I cash in on a $115 pro line ticket. The football universe is back to normal. #FootballGods #NFLSunday
Aw, @LoyalistCollege, you shouldn't have. That's how you make a guy blush http://t.co/GGON3kAL4k @LoyalistSportsJ @loyalistgrads #Quinte
Get better @TOMayorFord. After you beat this can we expect a run for #CFL commish? @canadiancommish is done in April! #PerfectFit #TOpoli
0-2. Mathis out for the year. Not a good start. *sigh* #ColtsNation
Fire Pep Hamilton. Awful play calling. #INDvsPHI #Colts
John Mayberry Jr. is the best. #Jays are still in this race! #wildcard #believe
Had absolutely no idea @Nate13Burleson was Canadian. Not sure why this makes me happy, but it does. He's my new favourite. #NFL
Great effort in the 2nd half. Andrew Luck is a beast. #Colts #SundayNightFootball
Who drafted Allen Hurns AND started him this week? This guy right here! #FantasyFootball #iwin
Happy Football Day to all! #NFLSunday
The new Ray Lewis statue outside M&amp;T Bank Stadium is super gangster. Well done @Ravens. #NFL
Is it Sunday yet? #ColtsNation #coltsvsbroncos
Dalton Pompey makes #MLB debut. Way to represent both the Oakville Royals and Canada! #oakville #NorthernUprising
Day 1 fantasy baseball playoffs - forget to start Cole Hamels. Bad start. #FantasyProblems
Firing Bo Porter as #Astros manager is like firing your babysitter. Not fair. #MLB
Alex Smith's 2013 warranted him $68M at $17M per year? Yikes. #NFL #Chiefs
#Colts made some really puzzling cuts today. Really don't get how Kelvin Sheppard/Weslye Saunders don't make this team. #NFLcuts #NFL
Any #fantasyfootball leagues with availability out there? Looking for more noobs to pwn.
Storm lose 4-3 in OT after a dramatic 3rd period comeback. Looking forward to many more like this! #gpab #AJHL
Taking in my first @GPStorm game. MANY more to come! #gpab #AJHL http://t.co/UUKfEgWTZO
Enjoying a beautiful afternoon of @vancanadians ball at Nat Bailey Stadium! @BoiseHawks putting on a clinic #MiLB http://t.co/Umg8KegNwQ
Came across this guy yesterday. Big time #RoadTripWin. #Jasper #Canada http://t.co/dysGCsJTgO
Finally an #Albertan... Off to Vancouver for the next 5 days! http://t.co/wG1yNaUgmM
With the @REDBLACKS loss to @cfl_esks tonight the East Division now has a combined record of 6-20. #ThatsSoCFL #CFL
I feel for Stroman, but as a #Jays fan am embarrassed at tonight's effort. This is one half-assed 'playoff run'. #MLB
Just spent my Sunday watching the #Jays for 7 hours. Yup.
#NFLPreseason is incredibly hard to watch. So many scrubs.
8 years/72 mil for PK? Makes Phaneuf's 7 year/49 mil contract not look so damn stupid! #Leafs #Habs #NHL
Dustin Johnson suspended for cocaine use? That's what happens when you party with the Gretzky girls. #PGATOUR
Jays! #MLBPlayoffs
The #BlueJays have now lost 17 straight against the #Yankees in New York. They have had a lead in 12 of those games. @cantpredictball #MLB
OH MY GOD IT'S AARON SANCHEZ!!! #BlueJays #MLB #BeenWaitingAllMyLife
So I got paid in wine at work yesterday. #gpab #q99live http://t.co/Aut7vY3Izv
The NBA is officially rigged. #Cavs #LebronJames #WWE
Raps have now locked up Vasquez, Patterson AND Lowry. Well done, Masai. #RTZ #WeTheNorth #NorthernUprising

Eugenie Bouchard, way to make us proud! #Canada #Wimbledon #GenieArmy
Happy 147th Birthday to the greatest country on earth! #CanadaDay
Anthony Bennett in '13 - Andrew Wiggins in '14. Doesn't get much sweeter than this. #CanadaBasketball #PowerShift #NBA #WeTheNorth @CanBball
What a comeback tonight for the #Jays. Total team effort - great character win. #BigTime #MLB
Really confused as to what #NYRangers thought they were getting in Brad Richards when they signed him. Numbers have been as expected. #NHL
The Montreal Canadiens didn't win the Cup. The Miami Heat didn't 3-peat. Thank you sports gods. That was way too close. #Blessed
Kawhi Leonard is the youngest player to be named #NBAFinalsMVP since Tim Duncan in 1999. Talk about passing the baton. #Dynasty #Popovich
Thank you to the entire #SanAntonioSpurs organization for not letting LeBron ruin basketball this year. What an incredible team. #NBAFinals
#Ontario, it was fun. Back to #Alberta. Back to work. #gpab #q99live
Some crazy old man has been trolling me on twitter for an entire day. Probably the last time I tweet about politics! #LessonLearned
