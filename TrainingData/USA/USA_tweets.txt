BLEH. I'm done being bitchy today. I move in May, and if my family wants to be assholes before I move. I ain't gonna try to stop them.
..happened. No. This is exactly why I never do anything with "family."

(Refer to previous tweets)
I don't need you or your wife's bigoted ass on my friends list. Family or not. You can not talk shit on someone and then act like it never
..on Facebook without someone jumping my ass. That's why I don't post about sports, and you say "should have deleted you long ago" Uhhh bye?

So Wichita State beat KU, which sucks for me. It screwed up my bracket&amp;my team isn't advancing, but it was a good game. We were outplayed.

On social media, you're not a hacker you twat. You have what is needed to log in/used the app they are logged in on. It's annoying
People seriously need to learn the difference in hacking someone, having their information to log it, and using their phone to post "hacked"
I seriously don't understand Kansas weather...it was 80 for two days and then yesterday and today it's been like 40...
Stuffed crust pepperoni pizza, it's what's for lunch.
Pretty sure I have an ear infection, but all I know is it feels like someone is stabbing me in my ear.
My step brother just told me to get rid of my dog. Um, bitch no. I'm not listening to you.
Anyone else watching the KU/TCU game? #RCJHKU #jayhawks
Walked into work this morning, boss asked Mia if it was me, and she said "NO, IT'S THE NEW BABYSITTER." Um no, I'm here until May
Kind of regretting this purchase. Lol oh well.

I love when I'm right. Mom's boyfriend finally looked at my brakes and it's the fucking brake line like I had told him a fucking month ago.

It is an outrage and a disgrace that Darren Sharper only got 9 years in prison. I don't care that it's a plea deal; he should rot in jail.
It'd be one of the best college basketball stories ever if Wichita St got revenge on Kentucky &amp; ended their perfect season in the Elite 8.
With the benefit of hindsight, it's safe to say 2013 Wichita State was one of the few Cinderella teams that was legitimately great.
Outstanding performance from Duke today, but Utah next week scares me. A lot.
That was as dominant a half as Duke has played all season long. When Okafor and Winslow are both on fire, there's not much you can do.
For the 7394728195th time... College basketball has too many freaking timeouts.
Not gonna make fun of the Villanova crying flute girl because if Duke loses tomorrow, I will look the same way. Minus the flute, obviously.
Just realized I chose the same Final Four as Charles Barkley. I deserve to be publicly shamed for this.
Villanova has been so impressive over the last several weeks. Just had a dreadful shooting day at the most inopportune time.
How can Darren Rovell have a job as a sports business reporter when he spews utter nonsense like this? https://t.co/SZFfNY6fMT
At what point does Willie Cauley-Stein get arrested? That man commits murder via dunk at least once per game.
All but one of the higher seeds won today. Going by the Law of March, that means tomorrow is going to be absolutely bonkers.
Dayton has won 4 out of 5 in 7 days w/ 7 scholarship players &amp; no bigs. Incredible, though having 2 straight home games in the tourney helps
All I want is some freakin chicken fries
Only good thing about school tomorrow is getting reunited with @Shadee_Tye
