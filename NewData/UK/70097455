If you ask me to take pics of you in public with your phone. Will drop your phone and say "oops". Sue me
Asking strangers to help take pictures with your phone should be prohibited.
The working process of taking selfies is painstaking for these females that's why they get mad when they don't get likes.
Hate when in public space and seeing unruly teenage girls taking selfies beside me. I kill myself on the inside

Tickle me silly
