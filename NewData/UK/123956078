Hopefully I can get it done tomorrow night.
Wanted to do video tonight, but too tired. So I've done some prep work instead. Got a little guide for myself to run through.
That was weird. Code I wrote earlier stopped working tonight until I changed Start() to Awake(). It worked earlier inside Start()... I... =/
The frequency of ninja-invites on steam is increasing. I must have a hat they all want...
Good lunch break there. A fair bit of progress made and some self confidence restored! *high-fives self* :D
Don't code when tired. Find a safe place to pull in and nap before coding again.
I have my first location working, mostly. Still more to do, but I think the structural issues I had last night were just my tired brain! :)
it works though, which is fine, but hoping I'm not committing some kind of code-crime! xD
if (thing != null) { do the thing}

Find myself 'fixing' things with this kind of code a lot. Is this normal or am I doing it wrong?
Let the dry-mouth commence! xD
Bruphen has taken the edge off. Need paracetamol to finish the job, but I only have cocodamol. A bit overkill, but will need to do! :)
I have the grandmother of headaches right now. Why you do this granny? :(
This code is 18 years old! xD
Think I'm just trying to convince myself here, so I'll shaddap! xD
I'll not be able to copy the code straight in to c#, so will still be creating my own thing, right? Right.
I just need a better hold on how to structure the classes. I had it in my head how it would all work, which crumbled at coding time.
found a really old tutorial for making a basic text adventure game, in Java. Luckily, I know my way around Java! :)
Suddenly: sleepyness attacks!
Got a few tasks done then started trying to tackle the more meaty bits and my mind drew blanks. Thanks brain, love you too... =/
