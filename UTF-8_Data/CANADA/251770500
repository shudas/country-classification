I just want to sleep..
I can do this, 4 more days.
Get me out of this shit hole town.
What's the point now... It's a waste
You can't trust anyone these days
I'm so exhausted, and my knees are in a lot of pain. Let me sleep for a week straight and I'd be happy.
A lot of women drive me absolutely nuts. Go fuck yourselves.
I could sleep for days and be perfectly okay with that
It's not even worth it now, whatever.
