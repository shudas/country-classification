Just managed to squat 65kgs. New personal best. Awwww yeaaaah. #GymGoals #138% of my bodyweight.
No more #GloriaJeans at #Broadway to get my coffee from. I feel betrayed.

Found it at #Coles. The #UltimateFightingLychee #LycheeMMA @ufc #lolers http://t.co/2rDROchvM6
2 wickets in 2 overs, not looking so bright for the #KXIP. I just can't wait to see @MitchJohnson398 bowl!
Maybe sending #Maxi in at number 3 isn't the best idea. #IPL #KXIP
Finally found a livestream of the #IPL. Tuning in all the way from #Sydney.
You wanna talk about bad decisions? Okay. Try eating Malaysian curry food and coffee. My tummy just can't even. #BadDecisions #Mistakes

After an extremely long day, my head finally touches my pillow. #AllIsRight #PureBliss
Accounts lecturer is playing 'let it go' in the lecture theater. #GodSaveUsNow
Absolute shit day in uni? This calls for a good session with my punching bag. #unilife
Itâ€™s Not So Funny When Bullied Kids Read Mean Tweets http://t.co/5pWgcq1cYe via @TakePart #StandUpAgainstBullying
Where in gods name did that crazy rain come from? Make up your mind Sydney. #SydneyWeather #Sydney
Perks of working at a gym, being able to roll out your back.  #SweetBabyJesus
Guy in front of me at my lecture is playing football on his phone, wish I could have that freedom. But I actually care about my education.
Put to asleep from facts by one lecturer and put to sleep from sheer boredom by another. #UniLife
Beautifully played by the #Aussie boys. Well done! @CricketAus what a way to finish off the match.
Last 10 overs #Aussie you've got this! @CricketAus Playing beautifully boys. #CricketWorldCup #AUSvSL
Come on #Aussies let's finish this game! #CricketWorldCup #AUSvSL

A 9 hour sleep is exactly what I needed after an extremely busy week. #FeelingAlive
Omg! I just got followed by @MagomedovUFC my day is complete!
I've made bad decisions, but the worst one was to watch #ImACelebrityAU while eating lunch. #ThanksGuys
Woke up at 6am for work. Do people even realize I'm not a morning person? #NotAMorningPerson
Aussie boys looking fierce today! #CricketWorldCup
Got some new people at the gym, but such a let down from what used to be. There's just no replacement for the best one that was. #GymCrush
Guy sitting next to me at the lecture keeps shaking his leg, and in turn the whole row of seats. I'm about to break some legs. #UniLife
Here's to first day of uni. Aim: make it out alive.
Finally got around to watching #rouseyVSzingano and holy shit! 14 seconds. @RondaRousey is a beast. #UFC184

I go to sleep for like 10 hours and I wakeup to see that the internet is turned upside down by the color of a dress. #Seriously #Stahp #Nuff
Just watching #Hercules again (Disney version) and I just realized #Phil used #Scar to wipe his face. Awkwardddd. #LionKingHerculesMashUp
All you other Sri Lankans can have your #CricketWorldCup while I have my #WrestleMania. Because THAT is awesome. #ManiaFever @WWE
Oh my gooooddddd #RasAlGhul wants #Oliver to take his place. #GTFO! Oh my godddddd. #BestDayEver @CW_Arrow
Omgggggg @CW_network #TheAtom is up and at em'. The suit is magnificent.
This episode of Arrow @CW_Arrow though! #LairOfTheDemon
The new episode of #Gotham really opener my eyes. This happens in our world, kidnapping people and using them for spare parts. #Shame
Oh my god @WWEDanielBryan this is not a popularity contest. This isn't high school. #RAW  @WWE
Every single match @HEELZiggler is in, he is outstanding! #ZigglervBarrett #RAW @WWE
#BigShow was a lot more scary, when he wasn't someone's pet. #RAW #ortononraw @WWE
What a perfect way to start Monday Night #RAW @RandyOrton is in the house! @WWE
The music of @theundertaker puts my mind at peace. #WeMissyou
I must go, my leader needs me. #Cenation #WWEFastLane @JohnCena
Noooo squat him! Grab him and drop him like a squat!!! @JohnCena #cenavsrusev
If @MichaelCole says #ForTheWin one more time, I'll fly to america and beat him up myself. #FastLane @WWE
The height on that drop kick. Damn. #Rusev #cenavsrusev #FastLane @WWE
Nashville crowd was completely quiet till @JohnCena came in. Man knows how to entice. #cenavsrusev #FastLane @WWE
Down with @WWEBrayWyatt you don't just call out @theundertaker and use his music to do it! Boo you! Up yours and your buzzards.
We got a bull hammer coming up! #ICTitle
I would love to see @TripleH in the ring again! It's been too long! @Sting make it happen! #WWEFastLane @WWE
#FaceToFace @TripleH is dressed like he's ready to fight. #WWEFastLane @WWE
Can we change the 'let's go stardust' cheers to 'we want Orton'? #WWEFastLane @WWE
Omgggggggg I literally lost my shit right now! He's back! The apex predator is back! @RandyOrton is back bitches. @WWE #FastLane
Anyone else loves watching the in ring chemistry between @WWERollins and @HEELZiggler #WWEFastLane
#FastLanePredictions: Bryan, Rusev, Nikki, TheUsos, Ambrose, Team Ziggler, Stardust. #WWEFastLane @WWE
My pretty bubble. #BubbleLove #ShowerFascinations http://t.co/zR9DiXuYXv
I'm just not a vanilla kind of girl. Never have been. http://t.co/TZ0H1GI8lO
Watched #50ShadesOfGrey last night, I have no idea why the hate. Music was great and the screenplay was anything but vanilla, how I like it.
This looks like a really poorly executed porno. #BryanVReigns #RAW @WWE
#BigShow does not need to crawl to the bottom rope, he can lift that goat up easy. #OverSelling #RAW @WWE
#JBL knows what's up. #Reigns and #Bryan combined can't beat @BrockLesnar
Boys please, we're in the middle of a match, not a popularity contest. #RAW #BryanvsBigShow #RomanReigns
I have no love for #Bryan or #Reigns I just don't see what you guys do. #RAW #BryanVsBigShow
Why does everyone keep calling #NattiesHusband #TysonKidd? His name is #NattiesHusband
This is a new kind of family get together. #JimmyandNaomiVNattieandNattiesHusband #RAW
It's not illegal, but contracts signed under duress are void however. #JustSaying #RAW @WWE
Wait, bell means stop? This is a match. #RAW
The bearer of #BadNews has arrived. I wanna see some #BullHammer tonight! #RAW
I'm just gonna pass on this match. I'm not interested in men playing dress up. #RAW
I agree! @TripleH is the @WWE
Now this is a pleasant surprise! Whoooooo! #FlairOnRaw #RAW
Just learned that English people call TV show seasons as 'series'. #NowYouKnow
Oh come on! That match was amazing before you got #J&amp;JSecurity involved. Top that. #RAW @WWE
I really do think @WWERollins is the future, but that DDT by @HEELZiggler was just outstanding. #ZigglervsRollins
Your 'point' was made very clear @WWERollins #RAW @WWE
The future is definitely 'Standing' in front of us. @WWE @WWERollins
He'd like to put his money in your bank. @WWERollins @WWE
Can we get a 'standing' ovation for the future of the @WWE #RAW
Awww yeah @BellaTwins in the house. #FearlessNikki and no @RealPaigeWWE the title belongs to #Bella. #RAW @WWE
Can we please stop handing a mic to #RomanReigns he just seems so confused. #RAW
It was hard to not see that one coming. If you didn't, you need to get your common sense checked. #RAW #RhodesBros @WWE
That was a big win for the #NewDay but a bad loss for the #RhodesBros #Awkwaaard #RAW
Great teamwork by star and goldust. #RAW @WWE
Family reunions are always weird. This is just too weird. #RAW #RhodesRhodesRhodes
Remember when @KaneWWE  was actually scary? Pepperidge farm remembers. #meme #RAW
Wooooo! #DirtyDeeds y'all! #AmbroseOnTop We have some bad news for you #WadeBarrett. #RAW @WWE
Nice kick by #Harper probably kicked some of #Ambrose's memory out. #RAW
What a DDT by #Ambrose #AmbroseOnTop #RAW
Nice flying cross body by #Ambrose! #RAW
#AmbrosevHarper one lunatic against another. #LetsGoAmbrose #RAW @WWE
I'm not American, but I'll chant as well. #USAUSAUSA #RAW @WWE
I hate that he has to fight to win #TheUnitedStatesChampionship considering he carries the company. @JohnCena  @WWE
Gonna tune in live to #MondayNightRaw for the first time. So you know I'm going to be #LiveTweeting throughout. #RAW @WWE
Wanted to donate blood today, but I was below the cut off limit. I'll be back, fatter and donate. #RedCross
All this pent up libido seems to be helping at the gym. #BodyGoals #GymResults
Word to the wise, never eat grapes or let alone anything when you're watching #ImACelebrityAU
I just bought the @VaselineBrand #BodySpray and it has to be the best thing invented. #BeyondAmazing #Chocolegs http://t.co/BkGNA5BiGF
Sometimes your #WingedDragonOfRa should stay out of reach, because it's just too damn hard to handle. #MistakesWereMade #YugiohReferences
Why is #Charlotte still in @WWENXT she should be on the main roster. She has more skill than most divas in on the main roster.
Found my #ManCrushSaturday #FinnBalor http://t.co/OReYwlMEX0
I'd just like to take a moment to appreciate Thursday for having the best TV show line up. @CTV  @CW_network thank you guys for good TV.
Can someone tell me why #Louis is god damn emotional. #SuitsRoadtrip @Suits_USA
Thanks to you guys, I had to ask my phone not to kill me. Thanks for that. @cw_spn
Super ironic when you boys are impersonating officers of the law. @cw_spn #ThereWereTooManyHashtags
Drinking coffee at 10pm was probably not one of my best ideas. #Genius #Derp
Hahaha this sign just made my week! Who is the genius behind this? #RAW @WWE @WWERomanReigns http://t.co/K1XvSPr2G7
Those days after the gym when you feel so attracted to yourself. #BodyLove #WorkIt
Pay finally comes in, and tomorrow off to pay the bills. #responsibilities #GrowingUpIsHard
#Anonymous you guys are basically modern day super heroes.
That annoying moment when you're so close to getting what you want, but its just out of your reach. Unless you grab it by the collar.
If I could get paid on time, that'd be great.
#BeautifulSydney #DarlingHarbor #IsThereAnythingMoreBeautiful? http://t.co/FvUGEi6osE
It's time to bring down the punching bag.
After watching the new @GreysABC episode, I am so glad I'm doing international business and accounting. #DamnSon
Yaaaaay the air con at the gym is back up. I've been in a furnace for the last 4 hours! #Civilization #Relief
OMG it all looks so different! So much more blue, which definitely agrees with my wallpaper. #BlueEyesWhiteDragon http://t.co/KLkshMs0b6
OMG OMG OMG I finally made enough space to install #Lollipop #bestdayever
Yeah if #USYD could release our timetables so we can plan work shifts, that'd be great. #Behind #Frustrated
Pretty sure one of the guys at the gym just let one rip right in front of me. Must find air. #CantBreathe #SoVile
#SydneyWeather unpredictable as always.
Finally got a comment getting upvotes on @9GAG and now the notifications won't stop. #firstworldproblems
I wanna update to #Lollipop but there's no more space on my phone. Monkey feathers.
Watching the #Superbowl49 from #DownUnder.
There was space for two. #ReWriteAFilmIn5Words #Titanic http://t.co/5jRZBhLlTz
May sound a little morbid, but man am I glad #Kai won. @ChristophrWood @CW_VampDiaries
Finally they're back! Men in #Suits #SuitsReturns Am I about to get #LittUp?
I love working night shifts. @iTrain_Fitness  #WorkHardPlayHarder
Are you using anyone in the current locker room or just gonna use past superstars like #DDP. Just saying. @WWE
If Bryan wins I riot. #RoyalRumbleIn5Words I realize I'm alone in the Daniel Bryan dislike. #RoyalRumble @WWE

That championship match was phenomenal. #WWERoyalRumble @WWE
