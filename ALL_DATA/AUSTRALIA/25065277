I'll bet the driver of the Ferrari's words prior to the crash were "Watch this!"
Oops... Had the Ferrari a week, not insured, crashed it showing off and seriously hurt someone - what a dick. http://t.co/38uc4BDz4f
So my @surface pro is doing a Windows 10 preview update so I've now switched to my laptop that also want's to do a Windows 10 update. Damn.

Just finished off the Easter weekend with a few glasses of @darenbergwine 2011 footbolt. Very nice way to close out the weekend indeed!
My very almost Mr 5 just hopped up on my lap, farted then hopped off. I've raised a classy kid.

"@F1Photographer: Hearing rumours of high #Ferrari fuel flow rate... #MalaysiaGP #F1" @oz_f1_motogp
all of Australia be like #CWC15Final #CWC2015 http://t.co/2iidVbIy4N
Thanks @MClarke23 Great dig!
This victory is a great tribute to Phillip Hughes we could have asked for and an antidote to a painful summer #CWC15Final #63NOTOUTFOREVER
Appropriate that Steve Smith is in at the end.  Had a cracking summer. #CWC15Final
#askcrofty so we can assume that Melbourne was just a glitch then? This race was a cracker.
Right with #f1 over time to switch back to #CWC15Final
Love the banter @QPSmedia @VictoriaPolice . Need to get @SAPoliceNews involved. #CWC15Final http://t.co/teCIBtxaMc
I'm going to get pissed tonight - Sebastian Vettel. Classic! #f1 #MalaysiaGP
Never thought I'd say this but I'm pleased to see vettel win a race. #f1 #MalaysiaGP
More action in the first 10 laps of this race than the whole Melbourne grand prix. #f1 #MalaysiaGP
#CWC15 or #MalaysiaGP why not have both? http://t.co/s5XbTaCAdU
Pressure getting to the @BLACKCAPS? #GoAussie #CWC15Final @CricketAus
It's after 1 am and I can't sleep. Neighbors somewhere have doof food going. Have all night. :-(
