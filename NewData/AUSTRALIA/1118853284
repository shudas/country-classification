Hope #Bali never need help from australia. 
Hows 13 people firing guns at 2 bound men over trafficking drugs out of Bali allowed! #Bali9
Can not believe how much of a little sook drasko is on #MKR hahahaha.
It's amazing how many contestants have messed up so far on #MKR2015 yet when its time to judge others they seem to forget their own mistakes
The two girls on #mkr really need to learn when to stop talking.     Their egos are unbearable
