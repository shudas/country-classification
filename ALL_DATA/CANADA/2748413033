Adventure with @k4michu
Gonna go look for a fight pad in 10 minutes
I handed in a pile of work 
I feel accomplished
Every time I check VO, it's so uninteresting and the ppl on it are so... either awkward and young or old, delusional and bitter...
That cloud of dust to my feisu sucked omfg.
I wish I saw the weather warning for damaging winds
I JUST DUMPED A BUNCH OF CREAM IN MY COFFEE
My poor eyeballs
I WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO GET SOME GODDAMN COFFEE AND I CAN STILL TASTE DIRT IN MY MOUTH FROM THAT BASTARD GUST OF WIND
I'm hungry and there's no restaurants nearby...
I probably shouldn't... but ugh
Should I just leave and go on an adventure to find my fight pad...
Wtf do I even do now, it's lunch...
I even remembered to bring my 3ds today u little punk ass
DOESNT EVEN SHOW UP WTF
I'LL BUY YOU LUNCH HE SAYS
COME TO SCHOOL HE SAYS
holy shit i only wanted to close my eyes for 10 minutes
dude no, you approached us from behind, asked "so what are your plans tonight"
cornered us in the backlane with another car blocking our way
the guy was lying out his fucking asshole to kami's mom about saying "hi I'm a policeman"
How the fuck does he not expect people to fucking run, YOU'RE IN A RANDOM FUCKING CAR
AT NIGHT. WITH A GUN ON YOUR DASHBOARD.
he watches us as we enter our house
just slowly watching and it's really uncomfortable.
Literally no respect, no apologies, was really rude and even after being questioned(apparently it was some spot check or w/e)
Then it turns out to be an undercover police officer
WITH A FUCKING GUN ON HIS DASHBOARD. what the actual fuck.
It was actually scary bc cause we ignored it and walked faster and IT SPED UP, I asked "what is he doing" bc I'm fucking terrified
I get fucking horrified because it's night and a mans voice is fucking coming from some car.
Literally right outside the backyard to the house, a car pulls up and asks us "So what are your plans tonight"
man... I was on my way back from a sev run with Kami...
and we took the back lane.
I love starcraft so much, my fav characters are Kerrigan, Tychus, Zeratul and *looks at smudged writing on hand*... Jim Carrey.
#StarCraft
Raiden:OH NO!! Quan Chi!!
Quan Chi:yo i got have friends lmao
Raiden:Oh! Sindel! Kabal! And...*looks down at smudged writing on hand* Stoker
omg I heard a cracking sound where I roasted peeps
it's so hard to stay into D3 with MKX out...
&gt;Goro
&gt;Iconic
ha. haha. HAHAHAHAHA
the video isn't sensationalism but it really shows how little he knows about the franchise lol
how the tables have tabled lmao
Shinnok was the final boss in MK4 AND he was playable
"WHO IS THIS GUY, HE'S PROBABLY NEW"
WHAT 
WHAT LMAO
SHINNOK HAS BEEN IN THE FRANCHISE FOR +15 FUCKING YEARS, TOTAL BISCUIT.
AHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAA

I was gonna get GUMI English but I think... I want this so bad ; _ ;
&gt;be a game store
&gt;not sell fightpads
I find it hard to play characters that aren't Shinnok... I love the MKX cast but I just... Adore everything about Shinnok.
perfect zoning, perfect counters and he's not clunky! ;o;/
I wonder why he didn't get used at the tournament, they probably just had other preferences.
But w o w
I am loving everything.
WOW, Shinnok's zoning is amaze.
That being said
I /hate/ Liu Kang
he is a whiny emo shit
That being said
this is me bc Cassie Cage and Shinnok are cool http://t.co/0KOh3xNkxd
I didn't like the ending but for different reasons lmao.
She's funny, she's cute, adorable and her lines make me laugh
Cassie Cage literally did nothing wrong.
WHY ARE YOU BRINGING UNRELATED BS INTO IT?
LET CASSIE CAGE LIVE?? SHE'S SUCH A LOVABLE CHARACTER
SHE IS  L O V E
oh no, one woman with really in depth character was a huge part of the story BETTER GET MAD AND CRY ABOUT IT
Ed Boon never said anything ever about social issues, it just happened that way??
are ppl honestly trying to say feminists harassed Ed Boon bc of the ending?
what the hell
I wanna cosplay as Tanya... She still has darker skin.
I want her to be out as DLC already...
h8 tremor...
ppl who love Tremor... pls love yourself...
and that's why he's so great
Jarek is hilarious.
idk I'm not really a black dragon fan either 
But I also have strange tastes too cause I /love/ jarek
I wonder /why/ he was such a fan fav, he's so zzz
Tremor is ugly imo...
holy shit
Mayuri from Steins;Gate and Cassie Cage have the same voice actresses... ;o;
tfw shinnok http://t.co/AlWSVeo2MF

One more annoyance of the day:  Imitation is not flattery, please get some originality and STOP DOING WHAT I DO

MMIW AWARENESS &gt; FUCKING SPAM PORN
It keeps the unnecessary shit out of sight SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SPREAD POSTS ABOUT MMIW.
IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT CONCEPT.
which is CHECK YOUR FUCKING SECURITY SETTINGS OR CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.
I wish people would stop bumping spam posts, report them and fucking move on with their life. 
or do what I actually suggested.
I give ppl too much credit...
ugh.
ugh. ugh. ugggh.
security settings aren't a hard fucking concept.

(even if it's not in my name, I am still Shinnok's ONLY kanojo)
I just removed it cause ppl were getting annoying about it...
I just muted the guy from my mentions
But yeah, I know spoilers can be uncool as fuck when you want to experience it for yourself! ;o;/
some random person spoiled a Shinnok thing for me saying "lol I told u cause u like Shinnok"
but PSA cause multiple mutuals aren't getting the game tonight, I won't be spoiling anything!!
I will post my Shinnok tears though...
Nearly everyone who's heard my voice tells me it's deep or that I sound like a 12yr old boy...
Going to be streaming MKX around 10-11 PM CST;o;/
I won't be the one talking though

I hate @EBGamesCanada for not giving a shit on the phone.
OK you're not having a midnight release, at least GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR PRODUCTS
