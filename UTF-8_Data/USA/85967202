Kansas should sign a bill that helps the governor effectively budget tax money.

Just a thought: if Hernandez was drafted by a team in the West, would all his knucklehead shit follow him? Pats took gamble on hometown kid
So creeped out on how collected @AaronHernandez is!!!
Not being in San Antonio this morning made me sick. #stomachupset #USAvMEX
Entering GC now smells like day old whisky breath. #ethanolplant
Good for Perry Ellis staying at KU for his final year.
Those Yankee bats be swinging well.
Never have I wished for a David Ortiz HR...until now. #fantasybaseball
So @st_abel45 &amp; I are driving under the same storm cell that produced a tornado near Kingman earlier. #prayforus
STOP FAKING @_VicenteFdez DEATH!!!! My heart nearly dropped! I have a firm belief he's immortal.
Storm chasing at least once this season.
Grandma hooking it up with homemade Chico's Tacos for dinner. :)
I thought #NationalBeerDay was everyday?
Anytime I drink Bud Light, I have a bad habit of wanting to pull the pong ball out of the glass.
The more college players declare for the draft, the better chances Van Vleet &amp; Baker stay at WSU for their final year...
Duke beat a 7 seed handsomely on Saturday. Wisconsin went to the wire with two #1 seeds in a 2 day span.
Oh oh! That moon though...
BUT WAIT...Romo is from Wisconsin...#badluckRomo
None of that Romo bad luck! #Duke
Duke should be grateful they're playing Wisconsin.
Duke has no answer.
I would hang out with old high school friends when I'm dead broke.
Okafor vs Kaminsky...love this matchup!
Rooting for #Wisconsin because I know somebody who graduated from there...? I really don't care who wins...#WisvsDuke
Why is "trap" music so addicting?
I mis my mom.
I love Too Short. Happy Easter yall.
I wanted to see a team go undefeated to win a championship, but Wisconsin deserved to win that game. #UKvsWIS #hatsoff
A 3 &amp; alley oop? #game over #UKvsWIS
Kept my streak of watching all Fast &amp; Furious movies on opening weekend in theaters. I'm pathetic.
In a street fight, Rousey can beat up Mayweather
Long John Silver hit the spot. #quality #midwest #seafood
Impressed by Kris Bryant's eyes.
Snow and tornado watches. #Kansas #weather
One day, I hope to be as gangsta as @MarthaStewart.
Shaka is going to Texas. Smart of him to do so.
Who is hosting the #MayPac? I rather watch it at home with friends &amp; I'll pitch in for the PPV price.
#COLLEGESLAM #TCOTTON
I wouldn't have been upset if Marshall went to Texas. Austin &gt; Tuscaloosa
Tuition will rise. I will pay off my student loans and probably still donate to WSU to #keepmarshall.
You don't touch @CH14_ in such manner!
Is this an international friendly soccer game or a Mexican pachanga? #MexicovsParaguay
Entra @CH14_!!! #MexicovsParaguay
THEN it doesn't help that half of my snapchat friends are there posting to their story! @OmarAngeles07 @crazylegz_11 @Vee_Ram21 @Gio_R21

All year I wondered why Michigan state wasn't ranked &amp; how they were in a down year, now they're in the #FinalFour...
I will openly weep if Van Vleet, Baker, &amp; coach Marshall all leave Wichita State.
I have homework, I have to pack, I've done nothing. #goodday
Checks ESPN app, looks at #NDvsUK score, jaw drops, runs for remote, eyes wide open.
Picked 7 of the #EliteEight teams correct! Damn you Villa...no va al elite eight...
Texas Western mention during the #MSUvsOU #lattin
Is watching #Ultra2015 snap story what it feels like when my snap friends watched my #MardiGras &amp; #sxsw story? #iwishiwasthere
I want to be on @tiesto bus on the way to #Ultra2015 :(
Don't care if it's just above freezing, I'm not wearing a jacket because it's spring now.
At least I'm not salty compared to last year's Shocker loss. I'll watch the remaining games this year.
Seems as if WSU left all their heart, energy, &amp; good shots in the KU game.
The final nail in the coffin...#WSUvsND
Wessel has 0 points...he's the X factor if he catches an itch.
Uuuuhhhhhmmmmm well those shots are looking quite terrible Shockers....
Notre Dame is way too big.
Chris Webber looks like he hasn't slept since he called that time out or HD TV does no justice for his age.
Just tossed water bottles to the paisas working on my roof. Reminded me of the @georgelopez joke.
&amp; I don't even play for the #shockers!
I'm not mentally prepared for this game.
What pisses me off more than an extreme conservative? An extreme liberal.
What ever happened to Kevin Kolb? #latenightthoughts
Bob Huggins will be 8-3 vs Calamari after tomorrow.
Up 1-0 #USMNT #USAvDEN
Gregg Marshall is boss.
Mom said there's no fiber in whataburger:(

Rollin' down the street with my grandma, sippin on prune juice...
Pinche, first world problem.
I'm running out of fun things to do...
Post road trip laundry &lt;&lt;&lt;
Who ever is re-posting those million dollar giveaways from the fake @FloydMayweather facebook account needs to stop.
WSU campus should be live today.
Promise this will be my final BB post: #KUvsWSU should be in reg season. No one remembers those games. Hard to forget tournament losses.
Throwing up the shocker to every car with Jayhawk affiliation on the I-35. #GoShockers #ShockerNation
You're welcome #KSU #ShockerNation

There's a lot of game left and Bill Self is still KU's coach...

Three players for KU have scored while three Shockers are in double digits. #WSUvsKU
These OU &amp; OSU fans at the Moore @BWWings are not rooting for #WSU, but are rooting against #KU. #WSUvsKU
.@RDB_sh31ox hit that 3 from Scott City! #WSUvsKU
Let's go #shockers! #WSUvsKU
I'm all for a #WSUvsKU matchup. I hate we have to see it in the tournament.
Mardi Gras then #SXSW? I'm too old for this much fun. #saidnooneever
Ohio is for...you know...#sxsw #hawthroneheights @ 6th Street, Austin, TX https://t.co/Ezjf55VJYU
Watching Hawthorns Heights at #SXSW has my high school self very happy!
Hard fought win! #goshox #beatKU
Lets go #shockers!
Van Vleet is playing like he wants to play KU. Baker needs to pick it up. #letsgoshockers
Canned water exists....holy hell the future is among us. #d√©j√†blue
LOL at #big12 basketball
Greg Hardy &gt; Adrian Peterson
Greg Hardy. Dallas Cowboys. Contract. Pen to paper?
Obama picked KU to beat Wichita State in the round of 32 matchup.....I ain't voting for him next year....
