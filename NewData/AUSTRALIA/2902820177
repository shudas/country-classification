We are lively stones in the building that is being fitly framed together; an holy temple in the Lord.
Get on your wedding garments accept the invitation and get ready to take the flight
Haste, Awake, Arise, Rouse yourselves.
Flee to Christ. Get oil in your vessels.
Get under the blood and get the mark of the living God in the forehead.
But God is love. God does hear and God helps you.
As Pentecostal people we should always be "prayed up"
Know ye not your body is the temple of the living God?"
God will use us if we are swallowed up in Him
Keep under the blood, keep white, keep holy, keep pure and God will give us wisdom.
Lets be first to say hello
All i need is you Lord
All i want is you Lord
All of you Lord
Take hold and press on.
