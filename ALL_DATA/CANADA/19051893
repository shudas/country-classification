Just reconnected with my old buddy on Skype.  Nice to catch up with him since he moved away to Calgary.
3.5 more working days to vacation!
Alexis' win margin was so high.  We ruled the polls.
Arsenal fans run Twitter.  End of.
Bayern's medical team quit. Didn't know they bought Diaby from us.
Can Arsene Wenger be knighted? Just asking because he deserves a 'Sir' title
can someone post the SSN poll, wanna see how far ahead alexis is
I wonder what it would be like if all the Arsenal fans on Twitter met up infront of the Emirates. I'd just be amazed to see peoples faces.
S/O to @galacticuche, proper gooner with good tweets. Follow!
fav for my opinion on your account
Arsenal twitter could make you an overnight celebrity if they wanted #ssnhqsanchez

#17 jersey for summer soccer league. Gotta live up to the number #as17
Chelsea gonna see out the season by parking the bus and attacking on the counter.  Mourinho won't take any chances.
Gonna be wearing #17 for my summer 11v11 footy team.  #11 was taken :(
Hopefully one day to Arsenal.  #dreaming http://t.co/uBYkpty3O4
All my life I've been above average in the things I've tried/done .  The only exception is dating. Appallingly bad at it.  üòê
Yes.  Can play around 10 Arctic Monkeys song basslines now.  :)
I want Wenger to celebrate the fruits of his patience and dedication in the coming years. His plan is very close to fruition.
Just got scouted lads http://t.co/3149HiJk9O

Just saw a few video compilations of Marco Reus. I have to say he's the most complete midfielder out there atm. Absolute joy to watch.
Hopefully Klopp doesn't bring Reus along with him to Man City. Want him to join the Germans at Arsenal.
New shoes imo http://t.co/bvPj5zuqiO
Arsenal twitter makes me talk like I'm in England with all the slang like 'lad',  'nonce',  'ffs' etc.  Positive influence imo.
Lads who remembers the band 'Busted'?  Man I wished I lived in the UK I wanted to see em live.
Are Monaco playing today? Can't wait for those frauds to get dismantled
"@ffsArsenaI: quote this with an unpopular opinion of yours" Diaby is a bigger fraud than a ponzi scheme
