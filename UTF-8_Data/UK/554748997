My response to this question. #milibanter #BBCDebate http://t.co/6o1t5TcKrU
Did Farage write the question? #BBCDebate
Yes Bennett! Slamming it. #BBCDebate
Audience member:
"Immigration has put public services at great risk." News to me. #BBCDebate
When are the tuition fee questions coming? And maintenance grants, funding. #BBCDebate #tuitionfees
Leanne: I'd disagree with my friend (Farage) on the far-right there. #banter #LeanneWood #BBCDebate
Glad Bennett is talking about our arms trade #BBCDebate
Glad to hear Sturgeon condemning the attacks on Ed last week. #GE2015 #BBCDebate
How does Nigel know what the EU is planning to do - he's never there? #mep #europeanunion #BBCDebate
How come @nick_clegg isn't at the debate? #BBCDebate
I would like "and let me explain why" as a t-shirt slogan. #milibabe #BBCDebate
We're an Island + Island nation. #dontforgetNorthernIreland #debate2015 #BBCDebate
Liking the more optimistic approach to trident, getting rid and tackling other actions #BBCDebate #GE2015
Guys. Mayday. Farage didn't blame immigrants for trident. #BBCDebate #ukip
#WhoWoreItBetter Liking Leanne's jacket, Ed looks quite smart and Farage needs a stylist. Good effort from all others. #BBCDebate #fashion
Farage: "I haven't mentioned immigration enough. Have to mention them more. Better throw some racism in too." #WhatFarageSays #BBCDebate
I love how Ed is so honest "we didn't build enough homes." It's nice to hear when politicians admit they got it wrong. #BBCDebate #Ed4PM
I think what Nicola Sturgeon did there, was take Nigel Farage and gave him a big burn. #BBCDebate
Nicola Sturgeon: "(Farage) in your world every problem is caused by immigrants"
What a babe. #BBCDebate #SNP
Farage: "the real audience are sitting at home." Slagging off the audience, well done UKIP. #BBCDebate #UKIP #Farage
Yes Dimbleby! You tell them. #BBCDebates
3 year tenancies in the private sector, banning of letting agents charging fees and capped rents, from Labour. Great work. #BBCDebate #GE15
The whole debate is about the General Election though, not the Welsh Assembly. 2 different bodies, 2 different elections #GE2015 #BBCDebate
This debate is far less lively than all so far. #BBCDebate
Farage: "all new UK housing should be for UK born citizens only" - he actually just say that? Jesus. #ukip #BBCDebate #ThisIsWhyIDrink
I feel like Cameron's lost a lot more respect not being there at this debate than he would being there #CameronMustGo #BBCDebate
Loving Leanne Woods suggestion. #BBCDebate
If people don't know what the parties stand for, then read their manifestos #BBCDebate
Come on Angry Ed. #BBCDebate
Oops forgot Nigel was there. #BBCDebate
Clegg and Cameron must be in marriage guidance counselling tonight, after last debate's divorce #BBCDebate
David Cameron did say we could vote someone else in if he didn't fulfil his promises from 2010. Thanks Dave, will do. #BBCDebate
Farage's "fantasy figures". Such great alliteration #BBCDebate
Hoping Dimbleby will bring out the sass #BBCDebate
At least they've got amazing Dimbleby hosting #BBCDebate
Where are the other parties from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? #BBCDebate
Apparently ukip think that all can be solved with the immigration wand. #BBCDebate #ukip
Quiet claps - how many people are in this audience? #GE15 #leadersdebate #BBCDebate
Glad to see tuition fees and housing being key topics. Definite kudos to the new NUS campaign too #BBCDebate
Ed Time. Not noticed Dave not being there. #BBCDebate
Best AppStore discovery for #generalelection #GE2015 #opinionpolls http://t.co/BBS4pd9FIe
Can't believe #Milibabe isn't more of a thing. #Miliband
Rough sleepers will be given right to buy their cardboard boxes #torymanifesto #righttobuy #newsthump http://t.co/8TLpnC9hDt
The Conservatives are as much "the party for the working people" as I am a man.
And I'm not a man.
#ToriesMustGo #ge2015 #torymanifesto

Someone is singing a beautiful rendition of Ed Sheeran outside the Leamington Jug and Jester! #leamington #warwick #edsheeran
We're at the pub, and through a well constructed debate, we've decided @Ed_Miliband is the man of the moment, and is incredible #GE2015

"Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people." - Socrates #generalelection #ge2015 #bbcqt #politics
Seems relevant #bbcqt #personalattacks #michaelfallon #davidcameron #dailytelegraph #dailymail http://t.co/tA2EnbXcTV
Honestly can't believe Mail &amp; Telegraph's headlines tomorrow. Would rather read about how our lives will be affected by policies #bbcqt
Ed Balls comments in January on draft policy that get discussed instead of the finished policy presented yesterday. #nondoms #bbcqt
Ed* being Miliband #bbcqt
Ed's right about it now. Next question. #bbcqt
Glad to see #nondoms policy getting applause #bbcqt
EPIC point from an audience member saying that you can read policies if you look at political parties' literature. YES #bbcqt
Ironic that a chap wants change and suggests bringing in UKIP #bbcqt
So the idea is that we have to have weapons ready in case of attack? #bbcqt
"It also shows how out of touch the government is. It thinks it's in a Cold War time-warp." @CarolineLucas being great #bbcqt
Happy to see Vince Cable condemning the Fallon article. Making good comments on deterrence #bbcqt
Mindless mud slinging does distract from the issues in this country, and they are huge. NHS, Cost of living to start #bbcqt
"We have to agree this is wasting everybody's time." #bbcqt #MichaelFallon
"Those remarks revealer a lot more about the characteristics of the Conservative Party than of Ed Miliband's character." Spot on #bbcqt
Oi listen to Dimbleby! So rude! #bbcqt
Can't believe she actually defended Fallon, idiot. #bbcqt
Elizabeth Truss is awful. Typical scaremongerer #bbcqt
Just seems to be the way the media spin in #bbcqt
Think that parties have been laying out policies? #bbcqt
Dimbleby is such a babe. #bbcqt
My computer has frozen on this. #computerbanter #banter #positivity #itissues #technology http://t.co/fi1RKh69FZ
David "Scaremongering" Cameron. Did they learn nothing from the negativity of the Scottish Referendum? #CameronMustGo #GE2015
