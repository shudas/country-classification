It's so tough to invite single gals to my parties because they're either somebody's ex, too much drama or somebody invited doesn't like em😩😔
If you got em out there, I'm going to look. We might be friends, but I'm a guy first an foremost https://t.co/5JsrgaueVQ

When none of your friends respond to your text. 😑
Let's put it this way: if we dated your heart's not the only thing I'd be touching #bootygrab4thewin #justsayin #yeaimcreepy #getoverit
I'm not saying don't let anybody in, just be you,&amp; WHEN she comes along your lack of needyness will benefit u because u won't have settled.
So why tell everybody? If someone's interested they'll find out on their own. Guys need to be happy with themselves before anything else.
I see so many guys nowadays put #single on their profiles.. Why? I don't NEED any gal to reassure my life's value or meaning..
When it's so cold your nips cut through your t-shirt 😳 💎

So ready to get off the ranch tonight 😳 I've been cooped up too long, I'm a peacock, you gotta let me fly!
No, no ✋ I'm not rich and I'm not sharing to gain friends. People come out of the woodworks for cool shit, or to hate. I say go for it 👌
Everybody's all "where's my invite?!" The fuck? We never talk or hang but NOW you want something when I have it... http://t.co/hqkcEG3C0B
Just stop. I'm trying to do other things with my life and you are just sour because I broke up with you.
When your ex decides to turn full clown on O-Town an dies her hair bright purple 😂🙈😳
Allie on boots: they're like "finger banging each others assholes"
Maybe
I'm just over here driving by brail nbd. Figuratively speaking of course.
It would decide to sprinkle when I start to change the hydraulic/trans oil in a tractor outside. An now I can't stop or move 😑
Why can't my parts be here already.. Cmon ups, I paid for speedy delivery not for a two day delay in Austin, Texas. #impatiencewillkillme
Annnnnyyyyyy day now. That'd be great
Waitin on a new windshield, a brow tint and a truck club sticker, and later next month a vinyl roof wrap 👌 #trucklove
There is possibly nothing better in life than freshly cleaned, warm clothes straight out of the dryer.
My time is my most valuable asset these days, so I refuse to waste it on people that can't even find time to text back #mondayrant
I just wanna eat cake, ice cream and pizza, have a cold beer and watch Netflix with an attractive gal. Too much to ask? 😂
Sometimes you just have to give it a chance, you might be surprised with how it ends
Sometimes it's tough to purposely not try so hard.. I guess when I really want something, It's hard to slow down
Nigga this you?? @ZachGaines http://t.co/W8B15knoOr
Things are going pretty well! 👌 http://t.co/bZ30xlJmzR
Hopefully getting the zipline up today 😍🙈 http://t.co/1Nf07xS36W

Sometimes I just get jealous &amp; have a hard time trusting. Then I think about how much fun I've had &amp;realize if it's meant to be It'll work
Kid buys a truck from sunrise an puts a few hundred into it an it's a "sick truck" yet mine can't get 2 looks because it's not lifted. Wtf
When she's upset and you have no idea how to help &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Why do women think they need to make extreme changes in their lives to notice a difference?
I've got my shit figured out, but I'm going to drink an party like I don't. http://t.co/blfkxYRmzj
But there's always a catch, isn't there?
Coincidence? I think not! 😳😝😎
The other night I saw a shooting star and didn't make a wish, because I was happy with my life 5mins later I took a beautiful gal on a date.
Women go like a bunch of my photos all the time, then when I try and talk to them they aren't even interested in talking to me. The fuck?
Pretty sure I broke some Asians neck yesterday driving thru Wheatland.. All I heard was  *krrrrrrrrck* an then his V-Tec kicked in.
One package was ordered 2days ago an still hasn't shipped An the other has been sitting somewhere for 2 days. #truckgamestressful 😑
When we do fun shit, we go big. Here we come 2015, we're building a zip line 😎 

(yes we will still do the slip an slide and movie nights)
If you drink a gallon of antifreeze, you'll never have to wear a coat again. Try it.
"Cummins 12v monster" 😂 unless you dump hella money in it, it's still gunna be outdated, under hp and slow. C'mon people
You like my pictures, you tell me to text you because "you miss me" yet you don't answer my text. I will never understand women.
All these gals like my pictures, but where are you in real life? Why like every picture if you don't wanna talk? Real life questions.
I know what I want from my love life. To not have to settle and not have to chase 24/7.
Face down ass up that's the was you fuck shit up👌 http://t.co/U3Q0vpGJyu
Give a girl a compliment: she ignores you
Be a gentleman and take her on a date: she friendzones you

Ignore her: she wants your nutz
Wtf?

Get your girl pizza, not pregnant. 👌
Ew.. What chick thinks it's cute to chew? I don't care how attractive you are, that's a deal breaker..
If I have to initiate the conversation every time we talk, and ask all the questions you're not worth my time.
I strive to be different.. And you're killing that for me lol
I guess mockery is the sincerest form of flattery but I still don't like it. Guess that means I have to 1-up again. 😑
If I have to text first everyday and come up with stuff to talk about its too much work on my end and I shouldn't care because you don't.
You know it's cold outside when your pee steams.
Really tired of all the judgment coming from your area. Please refrain, as I am trying to enjoy my life ✋
Why play drinking games, lose and get twisted when I could just get drunk on the couch/tailgate and be #winning #drinkology

Any friend that makes you feel less about yourself or what you have to make themselves feel better about their lives isn't really a friend.
Looking at polishes, compounds, glazed and waxes for detailing... I can't wait for this winter to start cleaning! #dirtydailydetailing
Weow. Thanks for the fuckin invite. You knew I was off work today.... I'm just tired of being left out.
Losing a dog is tough. They're apart of your life with their wholehearted affection for years, to lose that is to lose a family member.❤️
Have a beer and lunch then go to work or go back to work right now.. Decisions, decisions..
