First week back at uni and I'm already stressed. And this is just the first out of seven. HAHAH.

When journos condense several questions into one sentence... O_O
This is like the first early lecture I stayed awake for an hour. The reason being it's about sports reporting. xD &lt;3

Here then marks the end of my mid term break. Sigh. Back to torture tomorrow for another seven more weeks. :'(

Mom just sent a pic of her getting an ear piercing. So she now has three. Wow, she's way more hip than me. 😂
Everybody watching the press conference seriously needs to eat some chill pills.
Everyone's entitled to express themselves. Besides, that person isn't good at containing himself either...
And of course there are those haters. Just shuddup. People have emotions and it's a free world to whine/moan/complain...
It's only race three and there's already so much tension between those two. WWIII is about to happen. Team orders are gonna be broken.
Never firing? Well one thing's for sure, your arse was on fire due to your seat getting heated up.  https://t.co/AHYvhoYQLc
