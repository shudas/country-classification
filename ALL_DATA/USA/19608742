One of my favorite parts of Christmas is worshipping with family @ccvonline! Amazing service as always!
Was 1,700 miles from home and wish I could have been part of "Glow." What an awesome sight CCJ! http://t.co/mtvVZGGATP
Amazing how selfishness, when allowed to go unchecked, can begin to poison so many other areas of your life.
Mountains and sun. My kind of Christmas. http://t.co/WaMFFtwPpP
Looking forward to flying out to PHX with @BreBreMarieBlog in the morning to see friends and family for Christmas!
Excited for our Community Group Christmas party tonight. They truly have become family. #LifeIsBetterInCommunity #CCJ
No better way to start my birthday than hitting the weights with @DDBradley11!

Just got @JordanFouts Christmas card. Well done sir, well done!
Going over sermon on Community Groups 4 Sunday. 1 phrase sticks out, "We don't want you to just attend, we want you to attach!" #PictureThis
Sorry Angelina Jolie - Louis Zamperini's story is not just about the human spirit, it's about forgiveness and the grace of God. #Unbroken
I've officially hit my quota for December rain. I'd take snow over this awful weather at this point.
OSU has to be the first team to lose two Heisman candidate QB's to season ending injury in 1 season. Super bummed! #GoBucks

Shout out to Kurt Neighbors and Daniel Ross (@jdanielross) for the long hours they have put in/will put in to get in the new Worship Center!
Perfect fall day today. I just wish I could sit outside and do nothing but enjoy it.
Never been a Driscoll fanboy or hater. Hats off to GC for doing the right thing despite the media circus. https://t.co/YesAA5c6FI
First workout session with @DDBradley11 this morning. Prepared the get my butt kicked!
I think the biggest battle for Christians in our culture is showing grace when those screaming for tolerance show none in return.
Ran into one my college buddies @DavidDiener44 at OrangeTour. Cool to see how many of my friends are doing big things for God's Kingdom.
Getting excited to preach for week two of our "Monsters Under the Bed" series @ccjasperin tomorrow! #GodIsGreater
Incredible morning @ccjasperin! Just sat back and thanked God that I get to be part of such an amazing church.
Good luck figuring out college football this year. Every week is like March Madness.
Nothing like hearing "Afternoon Delight" playing in an Amish Restaurant surrounded by a group of 65+ year olds.
Spent the afternoon hiking at Hemlock Cliffs with @Thurmastat! Spectacular fall day to be outdoors. http://t.co/AuOBzSWwXv
"If you have private convictions that never make the public arena, then they aren't convictions." - Rick Atchley
Excited to listen to Rick Atchley and Bob Russell at Preacher to Preacher @ccjasperin today! #CCJ
Bought into the marketing and joined @DollarShaveClub! Blown away by the product and the hundreds I'll be saving. #GoneWithGillette
Such a great night @CCJWellTeens! Loved the worship party and watching hundreds of teens praising God. #CCJ
Don't miss out on Preacher to Preacher Sept. 23rd at @ccjasperin with Rick Atchley and Bob Russell. Register at http://t.co/IAyRi86gRr!
Baptized someone yesterday who came forward. I was preaching on giving. Another reminder that's it's the Holy Spirit that does the work.

Spent the afternoon with three other adults @Skyzone Evansville. Yes, I'm 27 and jumping on a trampoline for two hours was still amazing.
One of the worst coached and executed game I've watch the #Buckeyes play in awhile. Going to be a long year.
We've had lots of convos lately about how we can't get ahead of the growth in our church. That's the way it should be. #GodsWorkNotOurs
Well the #Buckeyes turned it around. Going to be an interesting year though! #GoBucks
Well the Buckeyes look like the young, inexperienced team they are. This Navy team is good and I'm hoping the upset doesn't happen!
It's Buckeye game week. I'm going to have a hard time focusing. #GoBucks #CollegeFootball
Thinking back to amazing morning @ccjasperin! Tons of new faces, baptisms and stories of people impacting their neighbors! #ArtofNeighboring

An incredible week of VBS with hundreds of kids learning about Jesus' love...closing now with a huge party and fireworks show! #ILoveCCJ
First neighborhood party was a success. Loved hosting and getting to know our amazing neighbors! http://t.co/MhRJsTF8CO
Awesome night to drive with the windows down with nowhere in particular to go.
Shout out to @hannah_eve  and her crew who are working this whole weekend to make sure @ccjasperin kids have an awesome experience at VBS.
It's not a gift of mine, but I'm working on being a person who asks good questions and listens...it's one of the best ways to show you care!
The more I work in the church I discover this - cynicism is a spiritual sickness that masks itself as wisdom and instead shows unhealth.
Choked up as I hear 1,200+ kids sing out at the top of their lungs "Christ is enough for me!" #bigstuf2014
Super pumped to head off to #BigStuf2014 tomorrow with @CCJWellTeens! Beach, bible and life change!
Darrel (@darrel_land) threw it down this morning @ccjasperin! I'm loving this "Beautiful/Messy Church" series on 1 Corinthians.
"Church discipline is not just about protecting the church, but loving and restoring the sinner to God." -Darrel Land @darrel_land
Another amazing week of camp in the books for The Well! Cool to watch God work in the lives of our students in such a radical way this week!
4 days until #JHCamp and 17 days until #Bigstuf for @CCJWellTeens! Let the #BestSummerEver begin!
Looking forward to a great weekend. Needtobreathe concert, speaking with my wife at the Illuminate conference, and preaching on Sunday!
Had fun playing golf this morning with @nwfarmer06. He beat me on this first hole and is now expecting a trophy.
We have a record number of JH boys going to camp and I still need some HS boys to help us out. If you are free June 15-20, let me know!
Baptism Sunday and our conclusion to the #follow series @ccjasperin was awesome! Glad I got to watch God do his thing!
#Follow has been one of my favorite series ever @ccjasperin. Great to hear people making a real connection to what it means to follow Jesus!
The latest on Generations Blog. Check it out! http://t.co/PD8R9DrPXR
Awesome night at our Senior Celebration for @CCJWellTeens! Got to remember great moments and challenge students to keep the faith! #TheWell
The new @JOHNNYSWIM album Diamonds has been on repeat all week. Good luck finding a better album this year.
Such an awesome weekend @ccjasperin kicking off our #follow series. Can't wait for the next three weeks.
August 30th can't get here soon enough! http://t.co/EETtc4oXJ8
Another record breaking weekend @ccjasperin this Easter. So thankful to be at a church preaching the Gospel and reaching the lost!
I think this every Easter..."Why don't  churches put this much effort in presenting the Gospel and striving for excellence every week?"
2 1/2 hours on the driving range...no clouds in the sky...listening to worship music. Doesn't get much better than that.
Hard to find a better show on TV than #TheProfit. So many leadership and EQ lessons to be gleaned.
Big shout out to Lucas Smith who gives up his Tuesday nights each week to help me setup for @CCJWellTeens!
Looking forward to the next two weeks at CCJ! Easter at four times Sunday (8, 9:30, 11 &amp; 12:30), then our new #Follow series on April 27th.
Few things in life are more disappointing than finding out your father texts using emojis. #TurnInYourManCard
True story - The more I preach, the more I preach grace. The more I see what happens when I preach grace, the more I preach grace.
Welp great season Cats. Pretty poor game with terrible free throw shooting, but thanks for the ride! #GoBigBlue
Been a pretty wild ride over the last two weeks. No matter what happens Monday, it's been a memorable run! #GoBigBlue
I love going through The Spring area on Thursdays and seeing Hannah and Stephanie decorating and getting things ready for Sunday. They rock!
While lots seem to hate the ending, I thought it was kinda cool. Thanks for all the memories #HIMYM!
