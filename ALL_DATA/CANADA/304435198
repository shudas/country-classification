Morning greetings from the Hank https://t.co/I8ewdJ5hxA
We will begin to see this romanticization from activists of being on the "terrorist list" with #billc51. It will be an activist's ego profit
We are not indigenizing &amp; decolonizing simply by being present in colonial spaces- We must expand our own systems to indigenize &amp; decolonize
#TIEC2015 "what systems are in place that are determining the quality of life for not only our children but our grand children" @colby22sis
"We, as Indigenous peoples, live outside any human system" - @colby22sis #TIEC2015
"We need to be willing to break the rules of the system" - @colby22sis #TIEC2015
"Every decision we make is based on avoiding emotion- and the more we avoid- the more we comply to the system"- @colby22sis #TIEC2015
#TIEC2015 IndigiTalks is the non violent rage and passion of the oppressed being expressed all in the name of freedom‚úä
Self accountability- an ongoing struggle. With it we wouldn't have feminists, racism, sexism, environmental violence. Its all a blame game
we are battling the govt against pipelines, poverty, drinking water, violence, and violence against each other- rather than colonialism.
When everything dissolves- what is left? Just yourself- no one else. Accept and love.
#COOEdConf2015 a place to discuss the realities and hear the truths- and how to overcome colonial boundaries
They searched my hair in airport security for the "random screening," that was bizarre. I felt like she was checking me for liceüòí
In modern society- Indigenous women are either glorified and glamorized, or raped and murdered, there is no in between
Depoliticizing oneself is first and foremost in the process of decolonization
I was Dora. https://t.co/fWfVzgWmOC
We need to be both fierce and loving to continue our legacies.
Why do we believe that talk and policy are solutions to a genocidal beast?
A #MMIW roundtable will not get to the core root of what is occurring across our nations. End colonial solutions to colonial problems.
Conversations of #WhitePrivilege often dismiss Indigenous Peoples entirely- another cause of "all Indians are dead"

Be a human manifestation of the land
We do not need more research bodies to fill in what we need for the communities.
"Land based practices" is an academic's terminology to how my great aunty lives today.üòù
People are blinded when it comes to the differences between "Aboriginal education," and Indigenous learning.

Think critically &amp; think outside the box are terms used to say that our minds are automatically restricted. In truth our minds are boundless
One is not racist, sexist, patriarchal, ignorant, or arrogant. One is simply colonized in thought.
We cannot fix a system we never created. We can only create a new system to destroy a system meant to kill us
Reservations are a living form of Indigenous peoples accepting being indebt to the colonizer when in reality the colonizers are indebt to us
Politics and passion should never be one in the same. Survival and passion are unilateral in context.
Why are images of children who are killed in war torn countries are passively ignored when celebrity wars are enthusiastically glorified
If hashtags changed the world we would be so far ahead
We act as though Harpers bills will further state who we are Indigenous peoples. The vicious cycle continues #breakfree
A fight for justice is a fight done with love
If what you do comes from a place of love- then thats how you know you are living life purposefully
The only people that truly need to honour us as Indigenous peoples is ourselves. Hold ourselves up.

One can rise free of blaming and shaming another. Be true to you and recognize your self power
Blame is a good way to let go of your own accountability. Pointless.
Love. http://t.co/YVWsByEm5A
"Never be ashamed of what you survived" there is deep love in that shame- love for self or another.
"Embrace the shame of what you survived"

Individual passions cannot create a collective sense of consciousness
A bad situation should not be the only determinate for one to see their own inner strength
We have falsely adapted to a way of life for survival so deeply that we have forgotten who we were prior to that adaptation
Hank and I feel the same about cold mornings http://t.co/vA6vXX7Wnx
We are the creators, and destroyers, of our own universes
When we deny our emotions- we are denying our own humanness

What if someone's bio of "she lives on the land" socially outdid "he studied at Harvard." #FlipPrivilege
Colonization is just as inherited as resistance
Morning yawns http://t.co/oriuLeKmAr
People in winnipeg be complaining about clean drinking water when most Indigenous communities never experienced clean drinking water
Some people will say its difficult to be Anishinaabe in todays &amp; age when in reality its difficult to deal with assholes in todays day &amp; age
Its come to the point and time where we have to depoliticize ourselves as Indigenous peoples.
Take your revolutionary words and ideas to the streets instead of storing them safely in the confines of social media #SocialMeltdown2015
We sure know our priorities when the biggest tweets are about social media sites going down. Distractions.
Disentangle the web of power struggles and oppressive systems within yourself to truly feel liberation.
We are more than just devote servants to the cause- we are devote servants to the universe
Gov't identification methods such as using the word "aboriginal" to identify distinct Indigenous NATIONS and PEOPLES is dehumanizing.
We can only be leaders for ourselves.
Everyday- be as fierce as an Indigenous woman during the revolution.
Our declarations are in our blood lines
We speak of liberation- but are we living it?
AANDC finds new debt tactics so that the only way out for our communities seems to be environmental violence agreements. We need new ways
Humans have gotten to a point where they see themselves as Gods over the land- when in reality, the land is God over us
When my mom was here visiting- my human sunset watching partner. It sure gets lonesome being away for‚Ä¶ http://t.co/mr4soCvX1H
Where do we go from here? Back to ourselves.
Resistance is not "political." Resistance is human.
We'd rather talk about the issues rather than solutions. Every. Political. Meeting. Ever.
The more that we rely on the feds, the quicker we will end up dead.

#FiveWordsHarperFears should really be #FiveWordsColonialSystemsFear
Id rather die in this struggle of oppression than thrive as a moderator of our own continued assimilation.
Decolonize your very existence
The hero activist- who feels they have all the answers to "save the people," will only destroy the collectivity emerging at the grassroots
The resurgence will not be seen in political offices- it will be seen on the lands of the peoples. With love.
Third world suffering has become a mode of achieving a photographer's fame.

What if all that we are- are living figments of colonial imagination? Deconstruct that image and declare your humanism.
What if Indigenous peoples all broke the rule of being patient in the face of injustice. The possibilities.

The shift of focusing on decolonization rather than politics is the avenue we must take in order to create change
Im done with patience and tolerance- who decided that impatience and being tolerable is a bad thing anyways
If theres no progress in your life- maybe the truth is you need progress in yourself

Never be ashamed of this one thing in your life - being emotionally human
