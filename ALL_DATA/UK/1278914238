This is too awkward
It finished early and now I can sleep!
Still dying and I now have to sit through a 4 hour training course... fml
Just saw someone tweet #slutdropsunday ....
Actually dying but last night was amazing
Well after all these years @dianbruc finally showed me a band that I actually like! @horomusic
Of course it starts raining after me and Diane decide to go out
I spent Â£50 today on dvds, a CD and headphones. I regret nothing
Hope Erica comes home at a reasonable time, wanna go out soo bad
Someone stop him from laughing at me pls and thank you
I think I just ruined a major part of GOT for myself.... FUUUUUUCK
Future Hearts is definitely one of @AllTimeLow 's best albums everrr
I lied. A hot guy came into the lounge so looks like I'm staying here for a while longer
Ok now back to my room with no wifi *cries*
To go home on my two days off or not?
Its frustrating as fuck
Seriously tho. 2 weeks and no youtube, live streams or snapchatting people shit they don't care about...
One of the few things I miss about home is reliable wifi
Whyyyyy?
Confused by the emoticons next to names on snapchat
