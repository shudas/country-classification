Kate Upton is probably a liar. She probably doesn't even play Game Of War
Im definitely #TeamQuentin because Harry is just a cranky camera whore
I found @CMooreMusic519 on YouNow last night.
2.3 million views. @HaleyReinhart crazy
I just saw the new Star Wars trailer and I think I shit my pants

RT if your #TeamKyle fav if you're just a loser
Well I was considering going to tour but not anymore
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
I'm not ready to lose @IamJoeyCook #idol
#SaveJoey
AHHH JOEY THIS IS SO GOOD
I almost want to save him but Joey
ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
Um...umm...ummmmm
Scott doesn't look happy with Harry lol #idol
Ok...that was perfect #idol
Harry's panties are in a bunch tonight. He is so grouchy #idol
Oooh I love the acoustic arrangement #idol
Proud Mary has never been done well on this show because everybody tries to outdo Tina Turner #idol
Harry's just jealous that Clark sang Frank Sinatra better than he ever could #idol
Welp. Shut the competition down people. @ClarkBeckham's vocal just sent confetti showering over him #idol
He sounds great but this choreography is so strange #idol
Goodness @IamJoeyCook's phrasing is incredible. And she is slaying right now #idol
I literally thought Quentin was going to knock Harry out #idol
Quentin looks like he's auditioning for some sort of bondage porn video #idol
I'm totally prepared to save Joey tonight #idol
Apparently Savion blocked me
This is the perfect song for him #idol
That was all wrong
Umm..this song requires growl...and Jax I love you but you don't growl you squeak #idol
There's really nothing that @ClarkBeckham can't sing. He could sing Dr.Suess books and it would be great #idol
She was a little off key but otherwise she sang well. It's just a little too safe #idol
This is just a safe song choice. #idol
Harry's in a suit. Did Hell freeze over today? #idol
It's #idol time with the best top 7 probably in the history of the show
My sister is blasting Carly Rae Jepson's new song and I really really really really want to slam my head in a car door
I usually find April 15th to be a very taxing day
Has anybody seen this? This guy is insane! http://t.co/1Yyel0L5RH

My neighbor has been playing the drums for the past 20 minutes. I wouldn't mind except he can't find a rhythm even if it landed on his head
Girl, are you a mirror? Because I can see myself in you
Ahem
It seems I'm being challenged to come up with a better pick up line.
Ahh memories http://t.co/U6s2YlJ2l2
I forgot I had an encounter with the stage mom once http://t.co/QiZj0mCqJO

#krogeroovooparty
Why did everybody save Deanna? She sounds like she sings underwater #TheVoice
#voicesavemia this is the only correct choice
#voicesavemia we shouldn't even have to be trying to save her come on now
Nice try Brian but you're going home #VoiceResults #TheVoice
Obviously the correct choice would be saving Mia Z #TheVoice #VoiceResults
Rob Taylor is a great singer but he looks like he colors his face in a with a sharpie #TheVoice #VoiceResults
If not spilling coke on my shirt, I'm spilling soup on my shorts. Apparently I'm a toddler
Team Christina could actually win this year #VoiceResults
Really? They saved Hannah? Were their TVs muted last night? #VoiceResults
So Sawyer got saved huh? America loves Cousin It for some reason #VoiceResults
#krogertwitterparties
It's nice to be on break while I hear @IanLlorian yelling frantically over the speakers for someone to help bag/ring up groceries
Directionless  #Guess1DFifthAlbumTitle
We Have No More Members #Guess1DFifthAlbumTitle
Looks like I won't be tuning into AVF this season what a shame
Twitter user @JeffAdolfson seems like the type of person that would try to make fetch happen
I saw this picture on my timeline and I think I could rock this look #fabulous http://t.co/EDTV0krXaW
One of the greatest country songs ever

If Amy Poehler ran for President as Hilary Clinton, then maybe I'd consider voting for her

Schindler Made The Dean's List  #CollegeMovies @midnight
Yes  https://t.co/qqqDg2nVWB
Well...@KimNicky just killed it though...threw it down Tina Turner style..SLAY #VoiceTop12
Really...House Of The Rising Sun..can we retire this song already..it belongs to @HaleyReinhart #VoiceTop12
YESSSSSS @meghanlinsey SLAY #VoiceTop12
Joshua Davis is going to be successful no matter how far he goes because he's got the Mumford and Sons vibe #VoiceTop12
I want to like Koryn but her voice is too low. Sounds like she has a cold. And she looks like Francine from Arthur #VoiceTop12
I don't think Corey's voice was quite powerful enough for that Jason Aldean song #VoiceTop12
Wow...@ItsRobTaylor just threw down the gauntlet. That was fantastic #VoiceTop12
Well Sawyer just ruined a Beatles song. #VoiceTop12
Tonight's song choices have sucked #VoiceTop12
That Rolling Stones song didn't really do much for Mia Z...#VoiceTop12
Well now...@indiacarney just slayed. #VoiceTop12
Brian sounds good but this song is so boring #VoiceTop12
Well it should be perfect...some of these notes that Hannah is trying to hit are pretty awful #VoiceTop12
Edge Of Seventeen is a perfect song for Hannah #VoiceTop12
Ok just started watching The Voice
Cayden is apparently the king of the bedbugs
So I've been  creeping on my lunch break..if you can't handle people criticizing your son on a competition it's time to get off twitter
Rihanna looks like she killed Grimace and made a coat out of him http://t.co/w0NfffEubg
But seriously if the Dixie Chicks don't go on tour next year I will set fire to the United States and cry for a thousand years
I've been Dixie Chicks af today
I didn't ask and she didn't say by Tim McGraw is such an underrated song.
To follow or not to follow that is the question
My iphone is playing 90s country songs back to back tonight and I'm quite happy about that
What happens in rehearsal stays in rehearsal  https://t.co/kVBdnJzqXv
I probably should have live tweeted the MTV awards show. I have disappointed the fans. Ah well. Can't please the fans all the time
Bad Teacher is on ABC Family. I'm not so sure that's a family movie
Today is just a blah day
Hi my name is Kyle and my talents include spilling coke all down my shirt
Good day to drive with the windows down and blast some Dixie Chicks #sayidokissmequickbabysonitsway
Update: my sister said she'd mow the lawn if i paid her so that takes care of that
I really need to get up to mow the grass. I've been saying this to myself for the past hour
My parents have a better social life than I do.
I got a job making tennis supplies but they told me I made too much racket
And Creep has hit 1 million views. Keep slaying @HaleyReinhart @scottbradlee @PMJofficial http://t.co/L8qSkSqaj0

Silence is most often a better response than "Yes I got your text but it's too dull or dumb for me to reply"
This @VancityReynolds/@AnnaKendrick47 movie is so strange. His cat bullies him and a dead woman's head talks to him from the fridge
Oh it has @AnnaKendrick47 too. And his cat bullies him in a Scottish accent. This is so weird
So I'm watching this movie with Ryan Reynolds about this guy who hears voices but the voices are his pets.
If I hadn't planned on seeing this before, I'm totally seeing this now  https://t.co/n2ixAqE2Xc
The Skeleton Key with Kate Hudson is such an underrated movie
