I assume @JoeHockey if everything is on the table you will include carbon tax and mining tax in your reform discussion? Thought not #auspol
before @JoeHockey talks about increasing GST he should close loopholes already in place on tax. NG, FBT, Trusts, Profit shifting #auspol
looking forward to @Tonyabbottmhr @JoeHockey say this is keeping their "No New Taxes" promise  http://t.co/GmhXEPPqvw @ABCNews #auspol

#metadata didnt really exist when u were a journalist @TonyAbbottMHR (not like today) so it's fair enough u weren't worried about it #auspol
I am sure ppl walking across the street in 1890 were not worried about getting hit hy a car either @TonyAbbottMHR #auspol .
does @cpyne simply not get it? My biggest issue with his plans for uni reform is that he wont consult and expects ppl to abide #auspol
I am still a member of #ausdems (I think, AAT Appeal ongoing) However I think there are many similar parties out there now to join #auspol

Private Education is a "Lifestyle Choice" @TonyAbbottmhr. We should immediately stop funding it #auspol
Yes @TonyAbbottMHR we shouldnt be funding lifestyle choices such as Salary Packaged cars, private health rebates or Negative Gearing #auspol

yes @TonyAbbottMHR Negative Gearing impacts property prices. it also impacts "Budget emergencies" $3b+ a year. Why then no change? #auspol
We need a Federal ICAC @TonyAbbottMHR if for no other reason than to investigate inappropriate "inducements" for officials to resign #auspol
Lets see if the AFP can remain Impartial and not "Partisan" http://t.co/bgPG94pgyR @abcnews #auspol
