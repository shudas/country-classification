He's cute but he stresses me the fuck out
Never too busy to miss you
My dad invited me over just so I could go get him Starbucks #whitegirlstatus
I'd do some pretty crazy things to be able to crawl back into bed right now
Too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
His mind was a library and I wanted to read all the books
I just wanna have one day where I wake up happy and go to sleep happy
Guys that think they're hot shit are just shit 😋
Re-reading old texts either makes or breaks your mood
RIP to me because of this 7am-8pm work day 💀
Sleeping alone is actually awful
Kinda cute when a guy's a little crazy about a girl
I love @tmullin99
Brb beating the shit out of Hayden bc he won't stop snoring :)
He's currently in the next room 😂 http://t.co/6XiAfsWHEL
Kissing in the rain is sooo cliché but sooo fucking cute
Tbh it's so hard trying to wear clothes that aren't black
That boy makes me smile
What it looked like day 1 vs today :) http://t.co/aFgeGszIfV
I should probably get out of bed
Girl logic: *says my subtweet isn't about you when it's obviously about you*
Boots and hearts needs to hurry the f up
Never wanna make ya mad, only wanna make ya proud
H8 that I always worry over nothing
And another hbd to this pretty lady ☺️ @hanngibsonn
Happy birthday to a great girl I've been through hell and back with 👸🏻 @KatieCollie
This shift can just not 😋
I don't even know anymore
How do I say I miss you in a way that'll make your heart ache as much as mine does?
This will be us @Laker_11 :)  https://t.co/1ajfjjmmpX
Drunk or sober it's always you
Yet I can type perfectly fuck ya
You know you're drunk when you can't feel your face
Team drunk!!!!!!
Death via tequila shots at 430pm
When bae sends cute texts 😍 http://t.co/0XSJzb96wo
First legal alcohol purchase in dirty Hull ✔️🍻
Stay in your lane bitchhhhh

Crazy 'bout yaaa 😍
Honestly fuck this
I don't think boys realize how much reassurance a girl really needs
Selfie stick purchased ✔️
Ok I'm tired of feeling this shitty 😔
Number 6... Sorry dad http://t.co/XbiPCWnvzD
Got 2 tattoos cause 1 just wasn't enough #yolo
New tattoo daaaay 🎉
Happy birthday to some hot chick with a really nice name @megan_mcparland hope it's the best babe 🎈😍
For someone who loves sleep so much you'd think that I'd go to sleep earlier
Alec is currently crying because there's a ladybug in his room
Guys who aren't afraid to tell you when they miss you are the best
Happy bday gorgeous 💝 love you &amp; miss you &amp; our venting sessions @cabergeron1
All I want right now is cuddles or a gigantic poutine
Reaaaaally just need to get disgustingly drunk in Montreal already @alecnolan @caitlynbuzzi
Sorry for caring
Easily one of the worst nights I've had in a long time :)
Someone plz tell me where to get a selfie stick asap
Why do guys always make fun of their friends when they meet a girl &amp; treat her like a princess? Like I'm srry ur alone but let them be happy
"Unofficially official"
Booking tattoo appointments is always fun
Reallllly ❤️ my life right now
You really do find out who your real friends are when you stop partying every night of every weekend
When bae snapchats you but doesn't answer your text http://t.co/oOFWNboXWS
I just want a thigh tattoo and a half sleeveeeee
Loving you is fun 😘👭 @kassiebarr
There's people getting puppies for Easter and I got a chocolate bar
In the Donnelly house we order pizza for Easter dinner :)
Never underestimate the power of random cute texts
When bae puts it in too deep http://t.co/0AFzdboMgv
When you see bae flirting with someone else http://t.co/aACAwAye3P
Haha okay I need to chug some vodka
Not sure why my ex has to text me every time he meets someone new but okay sweet :)
Dinner date with my #1 bae @alecnolan 😍
"I wanna go on a vacation"
"Vacation on my dick"- @alecnolan
Brb currently overthinking everything
Happy birthday to a girl I loveeee getting drunk with 👭 miss you so much @_lennamcneely
If you say you've never dipped your French fries in ice cream then you're probably lying
Just dropped the mcflurry I've been craving all day so that's how my night is going
Sleepovers with bae are the best kind of sleepover
This weather went from 100-0 real quick
8 days until Quebec 😍🍻 @alecnolan @caitlynbuzzi @karlyjones_ @ksnider15
Only thing standing between me and a 4 day weekend is this 9.5 hour shift 💪
I'm the type of girl that just cares too much
I just want cute bras, nice tattoos and a chance to see the world
Nothing sexier than when someone can handle my smart ass mouth and attitude instead of leaving like a little bitch
If you don't show off your girl what are you even doing???
Thx for the fun morning @alecnolan :) http://t.co/HY3vcJxLnX
Just wanna be the person you tell everything to at 4am when you can't sleep
Thankful as fuck for @Laker_11 😍
When you can tell you're gonna have a shitty day &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Always grab the booty
Either I respond within one minute or like 6 hours, there's no in between
"You’re the only person I like on Mondays and I fucking hate everyone on Mondays”
Nice try trying to make me jealous buuuut you still ain't shit
Happy birthday to my true love &amp; 1/4 New Year's Eve kiss 😏 hope your day is as perfect as you boo @mitchmcewen_
Nothing is worse than feeling on top of the world only to be dropped right to the fucking bottom
Whyyyy am I so saddddd
Next week my foster brother will officially be my adoptive brother and that makes me so fucking happy 😍
Just saw a couple on a date and they're both just sitting on their phones... How fucking sad
Who tf you really wanna be with besides me
Tbh I actually love it when people call me meag, it's the cutest
Sleeping alone realllllly sucks when you know exactly who you wanna sleep next to
You drive me crazy but I don't mind
