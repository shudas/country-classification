Well no voters. As another establishment figure is  let off with serious sexual crimes against children we witness the Britain you voted for
Labour Tories and liberals would love to extinguish Scotland. Keep Scotland's fire burning by #VoteSNP  #VoteSNPgetScotland  #GE15
Without fail. Every single radio news bulletin on every radio station national or community SNP bad. Establishment media control must end.
Anymore suggestions  for @JimForScotland  s singles collection mine is Depech Mode Tell me lies
Its so important  that all SNP mbers speak to every pensioner they know to warn them of labour scare stories

How long before the SNP  I.S. comparisons from the ridiculous @Telegraph
When you think about it each of the London parties promises mean nothing due to the likelihood of a hung parly and subsequent negotiations
What the remaining @scottishlabour voters are blind to is that all those attacks on the SNP are actually attacks on Scotland as a whole.
