#Venezuela 
Without guns or balls Venezuelan Opposition should hire outside help. 
For fcuk sake, innocent people are being held in prison.
He who will not help himself and who bathes in fear shall inherit a Maduro totalitarian 'asco' as daily entertainment &amp; everlasting dialogue
#Venezuela A country cannot be built on a single prayer. Venezuelans, you were supposed to think first before you had no money and no power.
#Venezuela. Look at yourself in a mirror. By surrendering your balls you are giving your children MADURO EDUCATION &amp; MADURO TYRANNY.
#Venezuela needs a war. The People of Venezuela against GNB. The People of Venezuela against imposters, murderers, traitors and thieves.
#Venezuela ALERTA Maduro can stop vital production of essentials in Venezuela but he will not stop Diosdado's flow of Swiss oil revenues.
#Venezuelan intellectuals have been incapacitated from their thinking muscle all the way down to their lame kick. Totalitarianism is winning
#Venezuela 
Maduro apologizes stating billions of dollars in Swiss Banks belong to him &amp; there is simply no money available for intelligence
#Venezuela 
Venezuelans will soon need a pill to remove intelligence. It's becoming too frustrating to follow the idiots running government.
TOO LATE #Venezuela  If each brave freedom fighter is afraid of using internet what courage is left to achieve positive change in Venezuela.

PRAYING FOR VENEZUELA IS NOT ENOUGH. 
The Devil runs Venezuela. I PRAY FOR VENEZUELA (ALWAYS).

TOO LATE
#Venezuela 
If each brave freedom fighter is now afraid of using internet what courage will he have when on Streets of Solidarity
#Venezuela 
Judging from past performance and fear of hurting oneself in the rescue of a country - today's Venezuela seems here to stay.
#Venezuela 
Venezuela - You inherited the harvest of your own doings. By doing nothing radical to stop it, you are going forward in the same
#Venezuela 
Being subjected to a totalitarian government really bothers me. And what about political prisoners - when are they coming home?
#Venezuela 
I feel bad when there is no noise coming out of Venezuela. Please do not surrender to Maduro's regime. I would like to hear more
Did Maduro block internet in #Venezuela? The silence makes me believe that everyone is in prison. This is actually true. Make some noise.
#DuffyTrial Canada's courts often guilty of prejudice while Canada's media strives to engineer opinion. #liberals @pmharper @ThomasMulcair
#DuffyTrial Liberal slush talk questioning Duffy's spending habits. What about federal culture of: fiscal year end budget spending fiascos?
Thank you @indtwt for your re-tweet and encouragement for my "preparing to publish first book". We will meet again. You can be sure of that.
"Only people with rhythm will read my poetry well" (I believe in people)

#Venezuela 
Do you think gringos are infiltrating Cuba because of American interest in Cuba's oil reserves? Give me your best answer?
#Venezuela Do you have an empty bedroom inside your home. OMG Poor people have no bedroom many have no home. Caution Ahead - Cuban style.
#Venezuela The longer nothing is done by Opposition to tumble Maduro &amp; his ruthless regime the deeper inside forever Venezuelans are getting
#DuffyTrial #Duffy If Duffy is found guilty all heads of government departments are equally guilty for senseless end of fiscal year spending
#DuffyTrial #Duffy  Senator Slush Funds are miniscule when compared to end of fiscal year spending of unspent departmental budgets.
#Venezuela 
Anyone on earth who finds themself as victim of terrorist and fascist style cruelty might just as well be in 3rd World War.
Martin Luther King Jr. would show Venezuela why men have balls. A nation should not kneel to gangsters &amp; imposters. Wake up #Venezuela
#Venezuela 
No great war has ever been won without casualties. No war has more casualties. Venezuelans cannot survive without balls.
#Venezuela
There is only one way the crisis in Venezuela can be resolved. Maduro and his murdering regime only understand Roy Chaderton law.
Premeditated, well orchestrated, perfect destruction of a country in exchange the #Venezuela private traitor club all get Swiss Accounts.
#Venezuela 
Unchartered times. Lawless gangsters as political imposters pulling off the biggest robbery ever, ...as the world does nothing..

Gangsters run government in #Venezuela . They should be removed as #Police remove #criminals . Unfortunately 100% of military are traitors.

Read the small print engraved on your Pots &amp; Pans. It clearly says: "Not Effective For Protest Against Totalitarian Governments"
ISIS on earth where people live. They should be castrated dead or alive. ISIS terrorists are not welcome.

I could tweet for a hundred years &amp; in reality nothing will change unless Venezuelan Opposition changes its strategy for combat.
Marketing my first publication. Let me know how big your network is and what positive things you can do to help me sell a million copies.
Suspended Senator Mike Duffy &amp; Trial is another dirty pre-election jab by Liberal backed media conglomerates (a new low)
We spend a lifetime developing inner being peace only to have some ass-hole, cock-sucking politicians do injustice to PEACE ON EARTH.
Stop #ISIS #ISISクソコラグランプリ from destroying archeological legacies. Catch an ISIS terrorist &amp; castrate him dead or alive. Do the world a favor
#Venezuela 
It will take more than pots &amp; pans (cacerolazo) to win a war against totalitarianism. Knives &amp; forks are more logical weapons.
Grandmas would use cacerolazos in pre-historic times but conquerers would use clubs or dinosaur bones. Cacerolazos are more a social event.
I just came home from doing an Open House. I work in Real Estate Sales. An Open House is a business event to expose a listed property 4 sale

#Venezuela 
It is extremely hard to keep one's morality clean when world leaders keep dirtying democracy.
Great suffering &amp; destruction of #Venezuela is a matter of global concern and warrants disciplinary response. Silence offers only #Hypocrisy
#Venezuela 
"In your face Maduro". Happy to be brain-alive and heart-aware. Twitter journalist informing untold truths about Nicolas Maduro.
#Venezuela 
The intelligent world knows about Venezuela. Hypocrisy of global politics prefers to side with silence. @MariaCorinaYA
#Venezuela Disbelief in Capitalism engraved into the hearts of greed-sucking, bank-robbing, mindless, heartless gangster communists.
#Venezuela 
Latin America is rapidly leaving hopeful hearts as it is pulled deeper into #tyranny . Government gangsters must be eradicated.
Quebec is becoming notably displeased with influx of hijab covered faces non inclusive with French Quebec culture, potentially its conqueror
#Venezuela 
There can be no compromise with anyone from Maduro's regime. That is like letting cancer stay when you are trying to get better.
#Venezuela 
Maria Corina Machado - My prided hero remains forever in my heart. @MariaCorinaYA May collective solidarity find saving grace.
In #Canada Justin Bieber, Avril Lavigne, Michael Buble, Alanis Morrisette, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Bryan Adams. #Venezuela Nicolas Maduro
#Venezuela 
New School Venezuela cannot be modeled after Old School Venezuela. Let history be a lesson never to be forgotten.
#Venezuela 
There cannot be civil union with the sword that killed so many. Military traitors must pay in accordance with military law.
Does anyone have an island where I can go to for a rest. Maduro is destroying my good morals. Today I strongly believe in the death penalty.
