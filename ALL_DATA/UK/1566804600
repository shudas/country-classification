If you don't trust your partner to the stages where you need to know their Facebook password then you shouldn't be in a relationship🙅

Don't get me wrong some men do cheat and lie but you can't justify that every single male on this earth is a cheat/liar, you just can't
"If you're a girl your man is inevitably gonna cheat on you at some point" 
- I don't understand how someone can even try justify this!?!?
My new double bed is so nice to sleep on but just doesn't feel right after staying with Martyn😔 #lonelybeff
Looking forward to a long overdue catch up with @NatashaaCowell tomorrow😊
Should really go sleep bc im soooo tired but film😕

Cwtchy night in with your boyfriend and lots of munch is enough to make any girl feel better😌🙈… https://t.co/BuhKaSnN6I
Unless that girl has her boobs out a lot or doesn't wear many clothes, then it's acceptable to moan about it
(2) of the day, he's with you. So what if he follows another girl, he wants you and not some girl he followed so don't just let it go
It's really bugging me seeing girls go nuts bc they're boyfriend followed/friended/liked a girls photo, yes it's annoying but at the end(1)
Im currently lying in bed watching breaking bad and knitting, what has my life come to😫
