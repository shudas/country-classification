Surely Klopp will go to Arsenal. As much as I'd love to have him at LFC I do still think BR is the right man for us.

Townsend scores a belter for England!!!!!! #AprilFools
The new Mad Max movie looks super tight butthole.
Very proud and inspired to see @elrich11 take to the field for his @Socceroos debut today.

Apparently in web dev there is a term 'god objects' that are everywhere and touch everything. Touching everything defs a religion thing?

Chances of me calling in sick tomorrow because of tonights performance are quite high.

Anyone in #Adelaide know where @gomvfc are staying. I need to get a photo with @BesartBerisha7 or I'll die.

Jones, Townsend and Smalling. England are Bella shit.
Life is one big user story. #agilebeliefs #projectmanagement
Ummmmmm how has South Korea got a flag emoji but Albania hasn't. Is this what the United Nations is for, complains of this nature?
I think I need to take Friday off work to try and get a photo opportunity with the greatest footballer ever @BesartBerisha7
I usually refrain from bad mouthing clubs in case I end up playing for them one day. But Arsenal, you offer nothing to football. #MONARS
This whole #PeteEvans thing combines all of my most hated things. Diets, toddlers, print books and mummy bloggers with opinions.
Answers to the questions nobody is asking (see previous tweet). This seems pretty Bruce: https://t.co/5CjjfROn5k
Best way to capture 404 data in @magento? Seems to be a lot of 'sort of' solutions but nothing stands out.

Oh my god, The Parade is pretty much a buzzfeed of poor life choices. You have one shitty kid, why the hell are you pregnant!?!?!?
Walking down the parade without a kid definitely puts me in a minority group.
My patronus charm would be a football. https://t.co/kXpIWnlgI1
Pretty damn keen for some @AdelaideUnited tonight. It feels it's been ages since last game day
Brenton Speed is like that annoying person at a dinner party who thinks that just having an opinion is enough, regardless of how shit it is.

Is this JHenderson's best performance for Liverpool? He has run this game. Fantastic captains performance.
Yes the S6 looks good but it will forever be held back by touchwiz. Runs a perfectly good device.
*checks to see if he has Janko in his dream team* #wswvsyd
Is it the #F3Derby because that key can be programmed to put your computer to sleep?

Seriously, how good is Slack.
So it's completely acceptable to use emojis, gifs and hashtags at my new job. Kid in a candy shop pals, A FREAKING MASSIVE CANDY SHOP.

God pinterest just makes genuinely shit ideas seem so good.
I heaps want to replace my bed with a hammock.
Adelaide Fringe really is the backpack and bumbag convention of Australia isn't it?
People who think running the economy is no different in theory to a household budget, need to sort their lives out.
Cracking strike by Morrison. Pretty forgettable defending by hammers. This could be a game of two halves. #dumbfootballsayings

I can't get over the inconsistent knowledge shared across big companies like @ANZ_AU and @auspost. Nobody knows company policy/procedures.
Is it immoral for me to use a unicode love heart as a favicon?

The jets actually offer nothing to the @ALeague. Licence should be revoked and they should be scratched out of the history books.
Mum just called me a 'hedonistic urbanite'. I don't know how to respond to that.
Oh my god. http://t.co/Wyy8E7Hhra
That ball by BEVERAGE. Wow.
Refereeing has been terrible. That is all I have to say. No argument for video refs, just employ better officials.
This ref, my god.
