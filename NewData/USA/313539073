Someone plz just come to my work and give me a hug and let me cry on their shoulder plz ill pay u
Apologizing in advanced about my weak sappy tweets today/ tonight
I'm never good enough
I haven't cried this hard in a while wow
Relapsing like a bitch
My chest physically hurts
At this point I really just feel like I'm wasting my breath here
