I add "just" to a lot of my sentences for extra 'oomph.'
Like isn't it just cool how the sky changes to all sorts of colours when the sun is rising and setting? #neature
Sometimes you honestly just have to enjoy the really simple things in life
I've learned so much this year.. about myself and others; I've learned not to have faith and trust in people who disguise well in a mask
This 100% sounds like a conversation we'd have lol @laceyhrynyk http://t.co/FX3XR1NWc3

I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world
I love the hype when the sun starts shining lots and the weather starts to be in the +'s. People are so happy and full of energy
Love is just a hoax, so forget everything that you have heard.

Seriously questioning whether I won 50,000$ or a car because I didn't roll up that rim and I usually have great luck. #frig
I got Tim hourtons today and didn't even roll up the rim. If I just lost a car I'll be pissed #RookieMistake
Well 2015, you've been pretty interesting and completely throwing me off so far that's for damn sure
