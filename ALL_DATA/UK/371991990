I think this sums up gregs night. @gregcandrews http://t.co/VMhsH1kzaT
Would a Slutty Elsa costume be acceptable for a fancy dress party?
The 'You fat bastard' chants at Big Show last night was the highlight.

Haven't deserved anything from the game today, but who cares anyway. We're champions #hmfc
Pretty shocking first half from hearts

whenever I find something mildly funny, I do that pathetic wee nose exhale. Hating myself for it.
Buzzing for the last better call saul of season 1
It's always great to see St Mirren get destroyed. Get them back where they belong.
Why the fuck is Eloquent busking in town.
Swear I just woke the whole neighbourhood up with that sneeze. Echoed for miles.

It's such a nice day☀️
End of the day... Who gives a fuck
Thank god Mohsni is coming on
People on their balconies eating breakfast. Folk walking about half naked. I know it's sunny but it's no bloody spain.
Calum's trousers feel like a Siamese cat.
I need this so much http://t.co/jYgFsOlQBB
The shop Tiger in town is just one big car boot sale.
#VoteGreen because every party is full of wankers, so you may as well vote for the smallest pack of wankers.
Cleo's developing an attitude #cheeky http://t.co/pqUcV47tyg
this weeks better call saul was one of the best of the season
Terminus was The Walking Dead's peak, but absolutely everything is absolutely genius. Season 5 was by far the best season!
This 2nd year group are shitting themselves going to McDonald's instead of school. Busy taken ties off, getting rid of badges and shite.
This state of a boy with an acne-infested face and long greasy hair got on the bus and yelled 'you're as wide as yur maws fanny!' #JustDie

Why did Bangin' Boogie reach 300 views... https://t.co/N5InYoqkuO
I just heard my mum shout 'fucker!' whilst she was watching The Walking Dead finale from last night.
Season 5 is the best one by far #TheWalkingDead
I've been waiting since season 3 for these two to meet again #TheWalkingDead
after The Walking Dead... #TheWalkingDeadSeasonFinale http://t.co/wU3nxP5pFk
WWE perfected Wrestlemania this year.
Only watched half of wrestlemania but still made me fall asleep at about 3, so worth it.
Cenaaaa
Dean ambrose got destroyed there
The crowd looks unbelievable #WrestleMania

There's this man at the back of the bus playing a hairdressing game on his phone. All I can hear is the buzzing of a hair clipper😭 #pro
Aliiiiiiiiim #hmfc
The thought of leaving school excites me, but also terrifies me.
Shoutout to the girl who ran to stop a bus she wasn't getting for the people running behind her
Why are so many youtubers bringing out books? #its2012
'What if were just a science project that some alien kid got a C on.' - @dmxze it's wrong how much this has made me think...

#NoZaynNoPain
That Cameron v Miliband advert is way too dramatic. They're politicians not superheroes. #SuperCam #MiliMan
I need to change my twitter name cos thisguycalledjo is just embarassing
I just witnessed an old guy in a wheelchair wheel himself out a side street backwards into the main road...
Somebody tell me why bangin boogie has 150 views?😂😭😂😭
