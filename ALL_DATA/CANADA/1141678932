Scribes should known Daniel would always pass
Burrows never gonna get a call
Jesus?  Is EDLER programmed to drop the puck as soon as he crosses the blue line?
Another non call on Burrows
Oh boy! Mark Messier is going to be on Hometown Hockey.

Well, that escalated quickly
0-0 Canucks and Kings after one period
#moralvictory
Philly not realizing that they're supposed to roll over on this game
Linden with a pat on the back for Bure
Nice try Nucks
Zack and Lack starting to shine
Zack again!
If there was ever a hat trick hiding in you, tonight is the night!
Canucks really need some young legs and veteran brains to pull this one out
Do we have anybody playing defense to nite?
Zack!
Good on you mate!

I’m calling that WPG scores first tonight against DET in @BudCanada’s #CallTheFirst contest. Who’s with me? http://t.co/3Sl3S9jXFQ

Congratulations, Daniel Sedin on 1000 games.

Now Quick is flopping and stepping out at Canucks #ruinedshutout
Daniel should just hit Doughty with an elbow to the head
Canucks really have to stop giving up breakaways
Elliott Freidman the only one  that makes any sense
Strombo has to go, what is this, hockey for dummies?
