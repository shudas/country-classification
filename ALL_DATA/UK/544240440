Happy Little Pill through headphones is just the best 🎧

Love having long hair when it looks nice but hate the part where I try and make it look nice #task
Wish I was better at getting up in the morning
Struggling, as usual, to balance practising and studying
Every time I get a question right in physics I literally feel like Einstein

Putting something off never makes it better 😥
Your timing is impeccable
Congrats RPO, you won
Literally just listened to about 10 different versions of the 3rd movement from Rach 2 so I could pick the most emotional one.
Everything I play today sounds like absolute ass. Love that.
Omg Aileen's started too
The amount of text books I've got in my case to take to Nyos is ridiculous! Doubt any will be looked at tbh
"@jacqstark: I think I'm gonna miss Jordan next week" 😄😘💕
Jacq's far too in to this debate
Might like to do Advanced Higher biology if it wasn't for the fact that all my faith in the department has been totally blown
My time hop shows me absolutely hating life this time last year
I feel so on track and organised, it's great. Hope it lasts
If I didn't like you as much, I'd shout at you 😫
My phone vibrates differently for each notification and twitter is the loudest and longest. U bitch @jacqstark
Can Jacq fuck off?
When your check list looks like this at then end of the weekend 🙌🙌 http://t.co/mTZP0yLk5b
That week before you go away where you can't wear any of your favourite clothes

Trying to find a good, modern, unaccompanied trombone solo that doesn't use multi-phonics is so difficult!!!
Omg I'm like the most far behind on PLL ever and it's away to be ruined. Cry

Just home from the show in Kirrie. This is not ok 😴
Pretty little liars isn't the kind of thing you can watch while studying. Takes so much concentration

Have a feeling my trombone's gonna be neglected from now until after exams 😢
Mr McCall helped me realise today that I'm basically going to fail everything. Thanks
Sounds like everyone's hating life. School sucks!
Cannot wait for 5th year to be over, constant head ache
Seriously contemplating not redoing my make up for the Scottish and keeping last nights....is that weird?
SO happy to have had the final rehearsal on Maccabeus 🎉 #burnit #unpopularopinion
Why did it have to be non uniform when we have the festival?! 😠
The afternoon off tomorrow sounds amaze
A load of people related to me by blood have come here and we're celebrating the day my brother was born, a day early.

I agreed to do a band call tomorrow. I have literally no idea what the musical is. Nice surprise for me!
Benefits Puff Off feels so nice and cool on ma eyyyess 💕💕💕
Sleep is just an awesome piece. Good one Whitacre 👌
Queen of procrastination: thought about practising instead moved all my shoes from the downstairs cupboard up to my room... 😫
Feel better after practising. Shame I don't have time for that anymore 😥
I bet that Dress picture was Madonna's idea to get people to shut up about her fall!
If I wasn't so lazy I'd still love to play in the Marines
Marines band last year was amaze, wish they did it again
Days like this make me want to cut all my hair off 🍃🍃🍃
Getting so excited for the Paris trip :D
Dont see how my bro see's his gf nearly every night, I'm either studying, practising or just don't want to talk to anyone 😂

Long weekend 💜
I get ill like once a year, why does it have to be now?

Robots should be invented for days like these.

Fall asleep eating a snack before bed, wake up with breakfast in bed 👌
Jacq is the best study buddy
Thank got it's the fields making that smell. Thought it was jacq 😳
Far too much bae on my Snapchat story
If you go through 5th year and don't think about leaving at least 10 times. You have a problem.
Where have my family gone?
The only thing stopping me getting up is the thought of having a shower and dealing with my hair afterwards. #longhairprobs
Too tired for 2 shows today
My hair isn't ok this morning
Wish I'd went to the dress rehearsal, still can't play the whole show...
That wasn't worth it
Such an idiot 😫
Guitarist at the band call yesterday was so pretty. Gutted I'm not doing more nights of Spamalot 😂
Too tired for another band call...
9 am band call tomorrow. Uuuuuhhhh
Hence why music college is first choice....
I spelt college wrong :(
Whiplash made me scared of going to music collage....
Need a plunger. Don't think I can go and play spamalot without one....
The smell in biology this morning still haunts me. Carnoustie high needs fixed
More work for next week means more money but a lot less revision
Band was such a work out tonight. I swear almost all if Maccabeus is forte+ 😨
