Banff, I am back ...!
Had a blast on Lossie beach this afternoon. Quite literally. Absolutely sand blasted! http://t.co/15h8DTM6l8
Blowing an absolute gale in Duffus. Plans for a bike ride shelved in favour of a run! It's not raining though http://t.co/5VbRgUinXu
Think I owe @FergusonLegal for this little beaut. Surprised it has lasted this long actually. http://t.co/T6EuxvIGxn

Just eaten half a tonne of pasta. Can only mean one thing. Race day tomorrow. 33 miles out the Deeside Way to Banchory and back.

Sick of work. Literally. #vomit
Reached a new low in terms of tedious meetings...
Multi-training Monday thwarted slightly by a closed swimming pool. Just a run and MetaFit then. Time to shower and eat brownies!
It's hockey time again, and Ben is sporting his new @Aberdeen_Lynx top from Gregor. http://t.co/xOiMxAuvwP
