Is there anything else about the house instead of tin foil I can use to make chicken dippers… clueless?
I tell you what, @DJMelReeves on snapchat is frightening… #boobs
I actually stay awake longer than people who have been uptown
Wild Hogs on channel 1… brilliant movie!  🎥
Goal, assist, and another win ⚽◼◻◼◻
Im just up, like that is dreadful
Cant wait for tomorrow's game, predicting at least 2 assists! #lafc
Only needed atletico to score…
Right whos coming to see fast &amp; furious today!
Cant believe I'm waking up to that news! Known cammy since about 6 years old and now this has happened, truly devastating! RIP 💗
I can't take the "deez nuts" vines only cause the boy is a full on retard
"@DeezNutsVinez: https://t.co/Ag8Nzpib4f" im greeting! 😂
"@CentreTransfer: That moment when you're playing full-back and your winger says he'll cover you. http://t.co/0IRlQG0IPU" @ConnorPont
Much better from the boys tonight, glad to hit a bit form personally after saturday! #LAFC21s
Taxi driver just stalled twice at the same attempt, im in pieces!
"@ProD_Soccer: That touch from #Baggio... https://t.co/sT21jcKiiQ" 😷😷😷
Sums up the game… only one team in this game
Hearts have spent the last 90 minutes in holiday mode… not interested in the slightest
Hibs deserve to win just from watching that defending, proves they actually want this game
Embarrassing performance from hearts
Hearts have been pathetic so far though… league might be won but doesn't mean sit back against our rivals!
Wait a minute… theres actually hibs fans at the game? Wouldn't have knew
Cant stop listening to Wiz Khalifa - See You Again the past few days, beautiful song!
I need to see fast &amp; furious asap!
Fuck toon, coldplay live from 2012 is on skyarts! Great watch!!
This dug man 😂😂😂
Well in @loviee97 ma laddie!
Losing in a semi final is not the way to start your saturday, devastated man 😔
I love it that people had a shit time at cav tonight, that shit makes me happy
Another party tonight staying sober, looks like I'll come home with more money than what I go with #taxi
Imagine Biggie was still alive and producing tunes, life would be good!
Going to sleep already, forgot how much love I have for my bed!
Boys… we're home @rydo_hfc @inglis_7
This bus journey is getting easier with the likes of take that on 🎶
Looks like the good weather is following me, london was roasting now on my way home and everyones gettin a sneak of what's to come! ☀☀☀
"@danielcalder2: football + speakers + kopperberg @ the beach would something else right now" 👏
Only about 8 hours to go on this bus 💤 at least london was unreal!!
Have to be out in 20 minutes and I can't even force myself to stand up
6 pizzas into the room from dominoes! Kick on
Hate to admit it, but wembley is unreal!
Have to leave to go to wembley in less than an hour… but none of us can move!
And of course, I've got right hand down it happening in the pub next door!
First day in london almost over… and what a long day its been, strolling about london since half 7 this morning 😷
I hate buses as it is… but one for 9 hours is just going to be torture 😕🔫
I am strongly feeling a couple of double cheeseburgers right now
That touch from nicholson 🔥
It took me an hour after getting up to realise that I have a free house
London tonight though!
Hearts just want rangers to finish 2nd eh
Happy birthday to my main man @SeanMacPherson1 and cheers for last night!
I am absolutely macca'd after tonight!
Buzzing to get ON IT for @SeanMacPherson1 21st!!
Thats why hes scottish! 🔥🔥🔥
Haha love having hibs as our rivals #bottlers 🙈
