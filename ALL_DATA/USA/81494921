Why are people being so mean to me today 😢
I don't think I can pull off this hipster or in Isaiah's words "boho" look lol http://t.co/UqbOOuHUyP
"Count your blessings white girl" -Bring It On
It's crazy that next week is the last week of the school year and I'll be done with my first year of college 😳
I feel very hipster today and I probably look it.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE HOMEGURL @g0_mezz I HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY GORGEOUS! LOVE YOU!
I'll sleep through yoga class tomorrow if I even make it there
I just wanna be off work and hang out with the bff @SaraLandes
My outfit for this weekend is 😍 I can't wait!
Still have no idea how you can still see my abs. I eat like a pig
Just need someone to rub my back until I fall asleep 😰😷
Need slushie/ice cream/NyQuil anything for this sore throat
That ab workout just killed me 💀
I never thought in a million years I'd be going to school to get my PhD, but I've never been so determined about something
Today was a good day to drive around with the windows down blasting country music
A little retail therapy never hurt anyone 😊
Wouldn't have asked for anyone else but these two babes to share the experience of becoming a Zeta with 👑💕 http://t.co/6aKENxrI2y
My butt has grown since last summer so now my shorts barely cover my butt .
Just two more weeks left of classes. I can(t) do it
Reason #1 I want to move out if I don't go to Tennessee next fall
Almost to the point to drive over to Sara's to sleep because I don't enjoy being able to hear the bass of ghetto orbit in my house.
I say I'm going to go run bleachers tomorrow morning but will I really do it? Nope.
Can we just fast forward to the weekend!? 😁😝
I spelled seperated wrong in my story but you get the point. Don't judge me
You don't know the struggle until potatoes are replace with cauliflower in your house 😑

My music taste goes from total white girl, to country, to hood
But thanks to @DarbyXOXO I had some yummy tacos 😋😘
I never thought I'd make it to my car alive in that massive down pour!
There's absolutely nothing better than shopping and my shopping song coming on in the store ☺️
Stephanie always sends me her time hop things from our freshman year in highschool. I swear we were the weirdest kids ever!
Everyone wish @Maarybethh_ a happy birthday! 💕💕
Another A 🙆
Ready for summer. Laying out in my pool all day 😊
Im eating carrot cake so does that make it healthy?
Just want to know my anatomy test grade 😩
My mom thought the hunger games involved vampires...
Last semester it took me an hour to schedule my classes and this semester it took me 6 minutes.
Oh how I've missed @AhSnapItsJonny snapchats 😂😭
"You a problem" ... Okay? Goodbye
Just accepting the fact I won't be on the deans list this semester. Psych is too hard
All I'm asking for is an A on this exam. Please?
Want. Pizza. Right. Now.
Needs to take test but goes shopping instead 💆
I love turning on ocean wave sounds and falling asleep ☺️
No one cares Duke won OBVIOUSLY so someone please help with my psychology issue!

Can the rain stop my windshield wiper is broken 😑
Body is failing from the past 4 days
When you thought you set your alarm an hour before you needed to leave but really set it for the time you need to leave. No one look at me🙈
It's that awkward time of the year where it's warm but not warm enough to wear shorts or dresses.
Those people that come into work and say "party of 9, 7 adults and 3 kids." 😑 so it's 10 all together? 😒
So glad I'm out of my funk. The past two days were miserable!
I miss @SaraLandes and @hannahmaelitton I feel like I haven't seen hung out with them in forever!
Why do I want to become a doctor again? 😩
I just really want to go shopping
Happy Easter from Smokey Bones http://t.co/huG5Bw6hFz
