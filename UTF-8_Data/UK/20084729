What an awful question, playing right into the hands of UKIP &amp; @Nigel_Farage #BBCDebate
If you're not going to use nuclear weapons then why spend money on them, so they look pretty in a museum? #BBCDebate
Should be said more often.  https://t.co/IhUCmTcUAy
Might move to Scotland for a couple of weeks and vote SNP.
Really really wish I could vote for the SNP: 'we want to get rid of the tories but we don't need tory light'
Nigel Farage is irritating me before he's even spoken #BBCDebate
Let's see how many @Ed_Miliband turns to camera and addresses 'people at home' #BBCDebate
On the plus side I no longer have to spend my days at uni battling with yeast 👍
REALLY want to watch harry potter. It's not on Netflix, sky go or amazon instant video. My dvds are at home..nightmare #firstworldproblems
University lecturer on channel 4 news saying he hopes nick clegg burns in hell...slightly harsh but I can empathise with his sentiment 😂
Went out for a civilised meal. 1x pitcher of cocktail, 1 bottle of cider &amp; 1 alcopop  (😳) later and it's time for 2 pitchers for £12...oops
Hatehatehatehatehate disorganised people ruining my plans with their disorganisation. 😠
People eating with their mouths open infuriate me. Close your mouth whilst eating so I can't see the contents of your mouth/hear you eating😠
😠
Yesterday's tweet now means nothing, it's throwing it down and blowing hurricane style winds...
Don't want to leave Liverpool, the amazing weather over the past few days has made me especially realise how much I really like it here :(
:(
Old Geordie Shore on MTV Lollll
I LOVE Gordon ramsay's kitchen nightmares, some of them are spectacularly bad.
Forgot to buy noodles for my stir fry so I'm eating a bowl full of vegetables and this worries me
Seeing some of the get-ups on some of the women off to ladies day...hilarious.
I get strangely excited when i get a poll card, is this weird? First general election vote!! https://t.co/t9J4oC89tZ
Sainsbury's chicken and bacon sub roll was absolutely rank. Only managed 4 bites. @Ben_Butterworth I blame you. Obviously.
Remember this @DannyLea28  http://t.co/xEUfyAksNx
Heigh Ho heigh Ho it's off to work we goooooo
Only one thing to do when you're left on your own (again) and there's nothing on tv...Disney films!
Every time I want to sleep with my window open I forget there's a pet owl in somebody's garden up the road. Stupid owl. Shut up.
Serious? http://t.co/l7gy88eFAn
Farage has not got a poker face.
Oh aup 'healthcare tourism' from farage. 
LOL
David Cameron pulling out the disabled child card, fair enough pal, but why have you allowed back door privatisation then?
Cut NHS services for Nigel Farage - he smokes and has a personality disorder, there's a saving right there #leadersdebate
Woohoo nhs debate. #leadersdebate
Nick clegg u r doomed should have stayed at home Tory in disguise #leadersdebate
DCam looks a bit sweaty, loooool #leadersdebate
I like Nicola sturgeons jacket #leadersdebate
Nigel Farage is just a chav with a posh accent #leadersdabate
Camera never catches ed miliband at the best of angles
Lol liberal democrats
Antiques roadshow 😡😡😡
George Osborne makes me feel nauseous. David Cameron gives me unpleasant shivers. You can feel the slime emanating off them through the TV.
Catching up on Cameron and miliband live, Jeremy paxman hasn't done too well in terms of being impartial...
Fair play to the girl wearing shorts with bare legs. Not that its actually warm. Just sunny and baltic #shivery #itsnotsummerputyourlegsaway
😠😠😠
Olly Murs - Up has just come on my iPod which means that today was a good day...
Need to stop looking at cute pictures of labradors on instagram and go to sleep
Awww educating Yorkshire teachers on the department of education adverts! Shame they have to use earning prospects to advertise though
Love the virgin trains advert with liverpool lime street on it especially how they kept the trademark pigeons 😂😂
Cadburys egg and spoon. Definitely NOT recommended 😷😷 https://t.co/oq4fd6NyzY
Back to Liverpool. Trains already rammed. Manchester - train now resembles a truck full of battery hens. #joysofrushhour
Off to Leeds !
And @Ed_Miliband has hair akin to the patterns of a badger 2/2
All I took away from the petty arguments in the commons about HSBC was that @David_Cameron needs glasses that fit the bridge of his nose 1/2
Celebrating masters assignment results with leftover pizza and a little trip to @TheBodyShopUK
This uni is shocking. Penalise us for late submissions but staff cant keep to deadlines. How does that work?
Parked straight across the pedestrian crossing. How I loathe lorries. http://t.co/IIki2NNE4o
Day of eating myself to an early grave, plan on being good 2moro..now have 3/4 of a leftover pizza that cant go to waste #dilemma #fml

So sleepy. So achy. Cannot sleep on sofa. But must find the motivation to move from somewhere
Went to sblended last night around 7pm, it was closed. checked opening times, should have been open til 10pm? @Liverpool_ONE
Sore throat. This had better be all it is. Cant be doing with tonsillitis again. Ever. Bed time for meeee
Was really lookong forward to my galaxy ripple. Until now @GalaxyChocolate http://t.co/UjQZbkogAU
Hate being wide awake. Realisation I'm a third of a way through my masters was terrifying.
Loving life now I can't sleep. Should probably watch crime dramas when it's light, or when I'm not alone.
Broadchurch was good as usual, enjoying the twists and turns, not enjoying how scared I am after a combination of that and silent witness
Silent witness absolutely terrified me for the second week running
When Alton towers adverts come on tv you know its time to go to bed, theyre preying on the fact you're tired and won't notice the prices
Love bumping into uni mates casually :))
Ed Miliband is sporting a rather badger-esque grey patch recently. Must be the stresses of Leader of the opposition
Time to catch up on broadchurch woohoo
All you people watching (and raving about) #MyFatStory clearly don't appreciate that actual obesity is an EATING DISORDER like ANOREXIA
Triton has lost his marbles hes destroying the human memorabilia
Contact between the human world and merworld is strictly forbidden!

"@UberFacts: Your brain needs the daily equivalent of the sugar found in three cans of soda to function." I can continue drinking 3x cokes 👍
