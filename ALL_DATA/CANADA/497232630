This guy on first take is the biggest (reverse) racist I've seen in a long long time
#MontrealCanadiens fans are quickly becoming some of my least favorite fans. I know its just some bad apples, but fuck are they arrogant.
#Bell just offered to pay my upgrade fee to get a new phone. Is the #S6 out right now? Does anyone have it? Is it good? #SamsungGalaxyS6
Luca sbisa -2. He's going to earn that overpay next year I tells ya #sarcasm
Sam Bennett has been good... Hate to say it. Also think he gets 2nd assist on that goal
Nice screen volchenkov
Woooo....ish... 
Yay #Vancouver isn't winning, I guess.
Hamhuis crying again... Nucks can't stop shedding tears
All stick. That was all stick!!!
Last year we knew the winner of LA/CHI was going to win the cup, Is 1 game enough to feel that way about winning the west? #hawks #preds
I can't believe how good this game is  https://t.co/C8HvJaO96T
Dubnyk, smid, potter, perron and petry. Am I missing anyone?
If Smid is able to play this playoffs that will be 5 oilers last year to play in this current playoffs. Over 25% of a game day roster
Late to the party I'm sure, but think of the headlines if Chicago makes a run with a guy named Darling starting between the pipes
Kelly hrudey impressed by a flames player, go figure. I wish rogers made him wear a headband everyday
Smart, but greasy by #Montreal. You've got plugs on to kill time, #Ottawa has skill out. Use a plug to injure some skill. Slow clap
Ummm... Who had Nashville up 3-0 after one? Not me that's for sure
Andrew Hammond has been trash tonight. Just horrible. If he doesn't find his game this could end bad and quick
It begins! The best two months of my year start right now. #NHLPlayoffs
Im biased, I think Yak is a very good player. His +/- is crap, but he was not drafted to play 200 ft. Oil fans all over him today. Hate it
"Connor McDavid scores! 3-1 Canada!!" Late night beer and 2015 #WorldJuniorHockey
Its hard to push too. Then it stopped just before the beers i have on it all fell off, 3 bottle caps just hit the floor. Creepy 3/3
Kitchen, noone was there. A friend and I are sitting at my desk and all of a sudden the desk drawer suddenly started sliding in. 2/3
3 weeks ago I saw reflections in my TV of legs walking back and forth in my kitchen while I was in the living room. when I looked in my 1/3
Another assist for Draisaitl. 3-0 series lead for draisaitl
OH CHASE NO!!! #Royals
My friend just tried to tell me that in sign language "I love you" is the same as "rock on". I don't care if untrue, I'm going witjnit now
Watching #Kelowna and #Victoria play. Just saw @Drat_29 have a big dip in the locker room during intermission. Haha, that a boy!!
Greg Chase scores for victoria. Love watching Draisaitl and chase go head to head
I am absolutely loving the #Avengers on #Kimmel . great set. Nice sneakers Robert Downey!
#Flames fan friend chirping me. "Bennett is a point per game #NHL player, where's Draisaitl at eh?"  Hahah
Pittsburgh is in tough with no Maatta or letang for their entire run. Take 2 of the best 3 D from any team and they probably don't win. Sad
I don't mind either team, but I think #Ottawa beats #Montreal http://t.co/GIb786RrQZ
I could not do this job, he's parallel to me and I'm on the 9th floor... These guys have balls http://t.co/V8kd8CbTV1
WOOOO YAKUPOV!!
Bozak?!?!? You keep Bozak?
Ooo 2 year deal for @Nail10_1993 

Get'r done buddy!
Actually really liked Justin Schultz year end interview. Did mention Defense and need to be stronger and better overall. Hope he succeeds
I think they should force Bubba Watson to eat non stop until he looks like a Bubba
I have no green thumb. And my cats keep trying to eat them. Its been two months and they live.. Somehow.
A family member moved n gave me my deceased grandmas plants. I don't know what they mean to the family but I'm scared of having them die...
I truly believe Lowe is going to step down. Katz will never publically fire him, but they both know his tenure is over. #Oilers
"@newyounggoddess: http://t.co/tV6Or62rfp"

The fuck...
I just feel stupid now. Betting on my Oilers to win Knowing Ben Scrivens is starting. Just STUPID
How do you lose to a team that truly and obviously not give one shit.
Jim hughson gets a boner every time the sedins get a shift. Pretty sure he blew his load on their last shift #worstoncbc
#NHL wants
 West ANA/WIN -WIN
STL/MIN -MIN
NASH/CHI -CHI
VAN/CAL -CAL
NYR/PIT -PIT
OTT/MON -OTT
TBL/DET -TBL
NYI/WASH -NYI
 #wishlist
Oh yeah... Scrivens is back in net
Woooo!! one more pouliot! Reach 20 tonight buddy
"It possibly won't be next year" MacT on Brossoitt in Oil silks full time. "Possibly"... To me means possibly next year Brossoitt is here...
Sedins got their diving ready for the playoffs
EBERLEEEEEEE
YAAAAAAAK ATTTACCK
Had nothing riding on this #Oilers game so bet my nucks friend a 15er on it. Tonight they have a chance to be a different reason I drink.
That game was so bad for O'Conner that I hope the #Oilers stay far faaar away... 

#probablynextyearsstarter
Never EVER thought BU would lose that game... WOW
OH MY FUCK WHAT A SAVE!!! #providence
If Boston, LA, San Jose + miss the playoffs, how far away are my Oilers realistically? Can a solid D or two, another NHL caliber goalie do?
If your Winnik, how the fuck do you not pass to Crosby in an attempt to win him an art Ross??? #penguins #NHL
Trying to send fanboy energy to Crosby in hopes he can put up a couple points here
PROVIDENCE!!!!!!!
SUTTER!!! 

I'm a bad Oilers fan
I thought the movie Ted exaggerated the #Boston accent until I just heard Jack Eichels dad talk.
There 1 providence line going and then BU gets free reign until they return..
Love Don Cherry, but to insinuate that Toronto is bad now because they ditched the tough guys is just wrong. Dons wrong. Still a beaut
#penguins have been good for 10 years and have two of the best players in the world. I get why they receive hate, but man. Entire top 4D out
Summer is to hot to grow hair. Cut it... Hate it.
I'm one of the #Oilers fans who has been begging for a true #1 goalie. Yet tandems like Calgary and Winnipeg have been suffice to make PO.
