OMG!  Listened to @MorningMashUp while driving through Northern Ontario this am.  #awesomesatelliteradio
Trip to Dr in Barrie today.  Too bad there are not adequate services in Northern Ontario.  Thank God I am able to drive to get services!
Watching Jersey Boys on movie channel.   #LoveThisMovie
I don't understand it at all.  Puppy loves everyone; except our neighbour!  And he is the nicest man in town!
I am so thankful for the sun. It is drying up all the rain and snow nicely. And any winter blues are blowing away with the wind.  #lovelyday

I love @VeepHBO  "Live long and F@#$ Off" ... in hand gestures!!!  Too funny!
Satellite 91 is not my friend!!!  There.  I said it.
Ugghhhh!   The satellite went down!   One of my favourite movies @beginagainmovie is being interrupted!!
Met a friend yesterday. Made my heart happy. Glad to know such kind people.
I love the movie @beginagainmovie  Watching on movie channel. Love @MarkRuffalo
"Will you still love me tomorrow?", by Amy Winehouse. Wow.
I'm home, in jammies and sharing sofa with Daughter and puppy. And not minding that my Hubby has the remote.  Nice end to great day.
One dance competition down, two more to go!  Next on April 23!
Where'd they go?  Everything was moving along and then it wasn't.  Crap.
Watching my daughter makes my own heart dance.  So lovely. http://t.co/7l2yqajw7t
My daughter takes the stage soon. Gosh I love watching her dance.
I love @joshgad   Absolutely hilarious!
I have twitchy toes.  Only at bedtime. You know what I mean, right?!
I want to travel. To Ireland. And the Carribean. Maybe I'll just roll over and go to sleep.
When It Comes To Tolerance And Higher Education, Canada Is On Top http://t.co/wvuWk79J2J via @HuffPostCaLiv   I say Canada is #1.  Period.
"@TeamCoco: More #CONAN jokes @ http://t.co/blm8FzvHYL http://t.co/2sWjmWm46r"  I vote for Flo!
I am very lucky and very blessed.  #goodlife
Just when I need to get to sleep, the mind is racing. Could win Indy at this pace.
Dance Competition Season begins!  On the road tomorrow. #dancinginthenorth
http://t.co/K8sn5UhbmX   This would be totally great, if only the new bin contract awarded to Canadian company.  Stop selling out to US.
Ed Broadbent says Canada became more unequal under Stephen Harper http://t.co/uZ91CkEu8L  Too bad Mr.Broadbent is not PM.

Puppy let me wipe her fur after playing in the rain. I'd say she is grown up,  except, she is tormenting the cat. Always a puppy.
It is raining today.  Actual rain.  Dare I say it?!  
No. Snow. Today.  
Yeah!
http://t.co/kYxLgx5STf  #McMaster #PayItForward #ProudofthisGeneration
Meteorlogical reports - those according to my aching knees - indicate a 90% chance of rain.  Who am I to argue?
Watching @lawandordersvul  Love this show! #greatcast
Just once, I would like all parts of the dinner to finish cooking at the same time.  #waitingforthechicken
Mr. Miserable. Looking for the puppy he  pretends to hate. We know the truth. http://t.co/vdyY0yJEtJ
Skin officially becomes old at 51. No medi  docs 2 support this claim. Just empty lotion bottles at winter's end as proof.

Always a favourite. http://t.co/Zgx7emqwKO
My Chevrolet has recall problem. To make matters worse, dealer says my VIN# not included in recall #thatsbullshit #nothappy @ChevroletCanada
There should be daytime electricity allowances for persons with disabilities and seniors.
I think that Canada should adopt autobahn - like attitudes toward speed.  If no speed limits, all would drive to abilities.  I'd be happy.
I was flapping my arms and my daughter knew what I meant. Poor dear!
http://t.co/37Z3eKYI4Q  Corporations need to take note. Employees are happier, more focused, productive and dedicated in a great work space.
Good comeback. "You smell like fabric softener".
They are singing "Betty and the Jets" and "Jenny and the Bets".  I'm not kidding!
I am pretty sure they are speaking the same language. The level of stupidity in the room is astounding!
If the doctor bills OHIP for that appointment I will be so pissed!  #wasteoftime #doctorwasanasshole
Why is my time so less important than this doctor's time?  #sittingandwaiting
Speed limits in Sudbury are ridiculous!  Beautiful four lanes and posted 60km. Ugh! #betterurbanplanning #Sudbury #sudburyproblems
Experiencing a loss, makes one so much more introspective.
Still can not sleep.  So very tired.  #mybackhurts #fibromyalgia #painsucks
There are so many things I will say to the  hit-and-run driver if I ever get to meet him. #stillawakeat3am #fibromyalgia #painsucks
I'm thinking the blind date couple on @AmazingRace_CBS  won't go too far personally after 'she' called 'him' #CaptainObvious #NoRespect
A snow day??? We have had the winter from hell and today is the first snow day? Wtf!  I am so not amused!
"@UnusualFactPage: Women are more attracted to someone with the ability to make them laugh. Laughter strengthens relationships." My life.
I wish I knew how to build furniture.  That is my secret wish.  Oops!
http://t.co/rnlNJmcYi4  OK. We all make mistakes. Perhaps our Senators should take a lesson on fixing problems!
http://t.co/hQxwrMIA78  Canada is built on immigration. Why are Canadians voting Conservative?!  This is wrong.
I have a flu and I feel like crap. Sigh.
I need to find a cleaning lady. I can't  imagine. I mean, this is a really small town!
Ha! I was just bugging my daughter. I'll likely pretend to be domestic for our  childless night. Who was I kidding?!
Hmm. Daughter is out til early evening.  What will we do?!  Hmm. Leafs game? Moulin Rouge?  Oooh the possibilities!
