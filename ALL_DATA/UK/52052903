I swear my gerbil just winked at me
So happy I'm off tomorrow ☺️
Trying to eat healthy in work is so difficult. I just wanna eat burgers and cakes
Man overboard and Moose Blood live, theres gonna be so many feelz 😍
I'm excited for gigs next week. I need live music
Idk if closing the kitchen alone is illegal but I know that a 13 hour shift with a 20 minute break definitely is.
Manager will be waking up to an angry text. I'M SOOOO DONE
I'm trying to make myself eat vegetables so I'm cutting them up really tiny and mixing them in with my other food. I'm such a baby.
Think I'm decided on a potential dissertation topic, need to do some research 📚📖
My manager was laughing when I was ranting about hating my job today. I'm sure he'll find it hilar the day I hand in my notice.
Ughh idk what to doooo
As much as I want a new job, leaving spoons just before my pay goes up by another £1 would be silly and I get time off whenever I like
As if I have to work in a kitchen with no windows on a beautiful day like this 😒
Seems I'll be moving into the library as of next week...so much work to do in the next month 😩
With tears in my eyes I begged you to stay, you said hey man I love you but no fucking way
I hate sleeping alone😩
When Keith dies 😭😭 #OTH
I do love new bedding 😍
Its so lovely how banquet records send you a personal message with your purchases
Mark kills me http://t.co/VM74VN6ITD
That horrific realisation that second year is over next month and that I seriously need to think about a dissertation idea😟
I hope I have a decent CV someday. When I eventually have a real job and am not a student/kitchen bitch.
I have a mountain of washing to do that I can no longer avoid. Being an adult is shitttttt
A 12 hour shift was not what I needed to finish off this week 😴😴
My dad shared this on facebook today #joker http://t.co/v4B8s6GANM
Dont wanna go back to work today 😭
Listening to Your Demise, that stab right in the feelz that I never got to see them live 💔💔
2 festival steward roles confirmed for this summer #festivalseason
Fun fact: you can take your cocaine to the police station in Amsterdam and they will test it for you and give you it back if its safe #crazy
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
Happy birthday to my babies @caffy18 @Claire_Gault. Get blinded at limers 4 me plz #wishIwasthere
Just realised Ryan Gosling is in Goosebumps. Throwing it right back to the 90's
Back to rainy wycombe 😒😒 now to sleep for a million hours 😴😴 so glad to see my bed after 6 nights camping/sleeping on buses
I have a sunburnt nose, not @x_LittleMiss_x rye day levels of burnt tho😂
And a fucking 12 hour shift first thing when I get back 😩😩 someone put me out of my misery.
Having to leave this pretty campsite in Amsterdam to go back to my damp house in Wycombe to spend a week alone. So tragic I want to cry.
Amsterdam is wonderful, I'm in love 😍😍
I'm SO glad I'm getting away from Wycombe for a few days! Exactly what is needed right now
😒
I think my boss forgets he needs his staff to work fuck loads of hours more than his staff need a job so he'd need to stop being a rude cunt
I have a million and one things to do today before leaving for Amsterdam #stress
My damp bedroom is a nightmare 😩😭
I woke up and there was condensation on my phone...my house is broke #damp #studenthousing
I guess you bit off a little more than you could chew. So you choked. It's hard to swallow a mistake you can't undo.
My feet physically ache😭
Just one more shift! I'm so happy I could cry
I have never seen work so busy. It's gonna be a long day.
I'm so homesick for northern irish food 😭 someone send me bpm, potato bread, soda bread, prawn cocktail tayto and a purple sukie.
Seahaven // Head in the sand makes me feel things
I'm so fucking exhausted after todays 12 and a half hour shift and I have another one tomorrow. And it's bank holiday. So many no vibez 😭
Is it sunday yet?!😩 #Amsterdam
#homesick
Should have went home for Easter 😒
Someone came to the door and asked if my parents were in. No they're not, this is a student house but obviously I look 12
I need suggestions
Where does everyone buy their vinyl?
My online payslips are unavailable basically every week. Spoons have a terrible system #sortitout
Rock im park all paid for yaaaay #festivalseason
Loans are in 😍££££ rich until rent comes out 😂
I would chin so many customers if I worked on the bar #annoyingcustomers
Can mark wake the fuck up plz I have shit to do, places to be.
I can't wait to get my iPhone back tomorrow
Flying to Germany for a festival, flying home and going straight to Norwich for another one in June. That's gonna be sick but exhausting!
New @wearebrawlers sounding sickkk
I think I'd rather have uni all week rather than work 46 hours
Amsterdam this time next week, praying the weather picks up
I don't want this week to end. I'm not emotionally ready to close the kitchen 5 times in a row next week. #thinkofthemoney #isitevenworthit
I should be asleep, I will never have a normal sleeping pattern
Refound my love for the ghost inside
I had no idea the clocks went forward tonight whatttttt
and disss #squad http://t.co/ZRRqGOlKB4
last nights pictures from the SU are actually decent for a change haha I'm enjoying this :)) http://t.co/9u83zhCYjW
I HATE starting work at 5, especially on weekends. Everyones shifts have just finished and mines just starting
Happily staying in bed watching netflix until work at 5, living the dream
Tasha told me to wait up for her last night, I was asleep by the time she got home but she got into my bed and made me spoon her hahaha
Me and stu want a mini k3 reunion @Maddymichele_ @amarakate
Wonderful night and I dont have work until 5 tomorrow! Happy days
Is this what being a grown up is
I'm so upset that by the time I go home it will have been 6 months since I was last home and I'll only be home for 5 wee days :(
On a brighter note I'm going to a 90s night with all the gaals to get very drunk so swings and roundabouts
I literally dropped £60 down the toilet, all jokes aside.
Having to use my old phone until my replacement arrives and wondering how I ever used this fucking thing, cry. #firstworldproblems
only gone and dropped my iphone down the toilet again
This whole one direction thing is absolutely ridiculous, cut for zayn and people asking for time off work. You all need to stop plez
Yayy
Such a grim day ⚡️☔️
My hair is fixed and purple for probably the last few weeks 💔 thanks doe @ohsoindie_
Listening to the lion king soundtrack isn't inspiring me to finish my essay it's inspiring me to walk home and watch the movie 😂
If my tutor tells me to send over work so he can give me some feedback, I expect feedback. I'm not paying £7.5k a year for fuck all
Easter is gonna be my trail run for being in Wycombe alone. Can't say I'm looking forward to it
I need to get up and go to the library. Surprisingly bed seems like the better option
Thank god I got tomorrow's shift covered so I can tackle this horrific essay for the final time 🙏🙏
Was so excited about the Bee Gees cover band this evening 😭 fucking subcultures. Fucking essay. Fucking laptop.
Because my laptop breaking is EXACTLY what I need this week, fuckkk everything
I'm a piece of 💩
I'm like '25 words in 2 hours' level of unmotivated today
Dedicating myself to subcultures today before Bee Gees tribute band this evening ✌️
can't wait to graduate and be finished with education forever  unfortunately I still have another year and dissertation to get through first
Just saw a fucking sons of anarchy spoiler😩😩😩 I was doing so well! I need to finish the last season asap
I’ll say it’s all about stickin’ it out and trying to feel forever young
talk about how your parents separated and how you don’t wanna make the same mistakes as them
Apart from spending £50 on trains today was a success
All time low have banter, I have so much time for that. And they sang all songs I knew at their acoustic show today, fab!
As much as I love having purple hair, it's just unbelievable amounts of effort to keep up
All time low and Real friends and vinyl shopping day in London #sundayfunday
2 weeks until Amsterdam 🙌
I would love to go out and celebrate a successful day this evening but I've been lying in the same position for two hours in pain lol
However my back to completely destroyed from braiding so many peoples hair constantly from 10am right up until 5pm
Today went amazing, we definitely managed to pull it off. Well done everyone @BucksLive2015
It's cooooold
I cannot believe I missed my Neck Deep boys at wembley this evening 😩😩 there are no words 💔
My uni event will finally be over tomorrow, I'm so glad. Never wanna try get sponsorship again
I hope the weather stays like this for @BucksLive2015 tomorrow! ☀️
I spent £34 on pizza ffs😂
Worst hangover I've had since I can remember
I have such good nights at unj with all the people I love and I'm like I never wanna leave England lol
I thought I had loads of time to write my essay turns out I have about 2 days of spare time. Not enough hours or days in the week
I love filling in people's dissertations surveys haha
And on that note, seeing any band in Belfast is usually fucking horrific. Always chavs or 13 year old scene kids being annoying
Belsonic lineup is quite disappointing, not that I will be home this summer to attend anyway
I just witnessed a drug deal happen in bright day light right next to a main road, not subtle at all #wycombewatch
I say not today satan all the time but seriously today I mean it 😴😴😴
Can't believe I missed my best friends baby shower😞 I hate being so far away from home sometimes 😞
And I have to be at Uni for 9am. Sound
Like right now I'm not even lying when I say I started work at 12 today, didn't get a break and literally just finished.
Working all day, closing the kitchen alone so won't finish until like 1am, have a presentation to prepare for tomorrow. Rip
I'm seeing Real friends on Sunday and had no idea until today and now I'm so content with life
Bed, ily m8
#ban12finishshifts
And I'm nothing more than a line in your book
Don't wanna work all day 😩😴😴
I want a puppy. Or a kitten. Preferably both.
I'll keep you in mind from time to time, like the rain in the summer
I wanna go home and lie in bed and listen to mooseblood plz #mondays
Everyone's gonna be very Irish tomorrow. I'm Northern Irish and I won't even be being Irish tomorrow
Wycombe traffic is ridiculousssssa
Not enough days in the week
So jel that my panda onesie looks cuter on mark than it does on me
Mother issues or lack of
Minor progress. I can stop having a breakdown now #uni
The biggest clump of hair just came off my head when I took my braid out 😩 no more doing braids on myself 😞
