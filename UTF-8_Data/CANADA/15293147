If I'd have been going to Celebration, I'd probably be at Disneyland with a folf today. @BlaezFolf
Well, I've responded to more than one so I'm surprised it took them this long. Being an Internet tough guy doesn't mean you're tough, broski
I responded to one of @femfreq posts and now I have crazy dudes telling me men are superior. Ker-block.
Instead of going to celebration or Calgary, I'm going to the city for dimsum this weekend. Sounds like a win to me.
Seriously. All that does is make you look like a douchecanoe. Or, at worst, the CEO of the Douchecanoe corporation.
Today's nugget of wisdom! Harassment is not cool. Stop harassing people because you think you're entitled to something out of their control.
I'd like to apologize to anyone who had tried to send me email thru my website, apparently my email form isn't working. Gah!
For those of you not after badges, I have several return Sketch Cards. Perna cards are $90US. I have CMII, Spellcasters, CFT. CDN at par.

If you need a badge for @fureh or another con, I'm doing them for $25. Will be laminated. Includes shipping. http://t.co/ZPUUhI6y3s
I won't be selling art at @fureh if I go because I don't know if I have that weekend off work. So! Look for the blue bear if I can make it.
HONEY, WHERE ARE MY PANTS? http://t.co/uZYTlddw2N
Wisdom nugget: Sometimes guests cancel conventions. Is it disappointing? Yes. Don't be a jerk to the con, though. It's not their fault.
DUDE. We may get thunderstorms today *dances*
Today's nugget of wisdom: Keep working at that painting, because eventually you'll get past the 'OMFG I HATE IT' phase and get to awesome.
Classic Fairy Tales cards! I did these for the Pernas. Hooray!
How I'm spending my Friday afternoon. @hayleyerza http://t.co/JKiy67hOgZ

I'd like to go on the record as saying that after being in a cast for almost 10 weeks, that first bath is amaaaaaaaazing.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! http://t.co/mbse4alW4v
Today thus cast should be gone, and that wiimote will be off the floor. Also, Lego! http://t.co/u3wQ1BmMix
Today's nugget of wisdom: if you think a convention's anti harassment policy is preventing you from getting a date, you're doing it wrong.
So I realized I hadn't drawn Dead Bird Head Guy in about a decade. So here he is in all of his sassy glory. http://t.co/eomnYXxTcv
Happy Easter! http://t.co/MEeJjljtUy
2016 marks 20 years since I left Australia. Did you know I'm a dual Aussie/Canuck citizen?
I'm going to try my best to do #CalgaryExpo in 2016 as my sole con, the rest of my vacation time will be going to an Australian holiday.
I've had a bunch of people ask, but no I won't be at either #StarWarsCelebration or #CalgaryExpo this year. The stars just didn't line up.
Bacteria doodles. http://t.co/HoYhOnlz4S
Ha! I asked for a turtle to be drawn on my pizza box, driver said they didn't but I found this. Awwwwww! http://t.co/7lSULRGlSX
Just another Friday night. Rawr. http://t.co/J7lp5nJ0so
Also, most likely Edmonton Expo. I can't promise Saskatoon, cuz I have a suspicion I'll work that weekend to get Edmonton vaycay approved.
Cons, this year, pending weekends off work. Regina Fan Expo - Drawing for donations @501stBadlands table. @fureh - to get rid of tons o art
A kitty I painted in exchange for some lego. (Well, and I need to send dineros for the exchange as well, was a... http://t.co/2Ht0oLLCyv
Yes, I broke three bones on Jan 31. Can't say I don't do anything half assed, eh? I'm number one! I did paint a kitty though! Post incoming.
This cast comes off in two weeeeeeeks. Then I can get back to work on everything. PSA: Don't break your foot. ESPECIALLY not 3 metatarsals!
Convention badges! I'm not taking commissions yet, but when I do they'll be $25 each. They don't have to be... http://t.co/srYMYf9ZXQ
Hey guys and gals! 

Do you want a Rebels return sketch card? I have three waiting for your own favourite... http://t.co/fbn62cKDFM
Just a reminder, I have three Star Wars Rebels returns available. I will draw what you want! DM me for price :D #sketchcard #starwars #topps
I have three Star Wars Rebels return sketch cards available, I'll draw what you want! Also, some from an earlier set.
Wowsers. When I nap, I nap like a champ. I slept so hard I thought it was tomorrow already.
Watching Star Trek: TOS. As a kid I thought it was hokey, as an adult I absolutely love it.
I’m entering to win @TheHungerGames #Mockingjay Part 1 on Blu-ray from @TheMarySue! #MayTheOddsBeEtc http://t.co/zbXAHhX5s5
Note to self, watching funny YouTube videos after surgery hurts. But it's totally worth it.
Sharky Shark and I are best pals. http://t.co/SdKxWWdeCs
Go watch "To be Takei" right meow. It's fantastic! 
@GeorgeTakei I had the pleasure of meeting George and Brad in Calgary. Awesome peeps.
I don't think I posted this, but I totally painted a spoon rest. My love of swirly abstract abounds http://t.co/71AkMypkHm
Good morning, Twitter, I made blueberry muffins. Omnomnom. #omnomnom http://t.co/ECyJOyc1Nl
Now if my cats would stop trying to drink my filthy paint water, I'd be fine.
I can't show you what I'm working on, but I can tell you that Copics plus watercolour equals awesome. http://t.co/l6xZGf2atm
RIP Mister Nimoy. Peace and long life.
Oops, I used poopy language in a tweet. Sorry to those with virgin eyeballs.
Here, have my ponysona! http://t.co/2IedVWm1jg
I liked Grand Budapest Hotel, but I think GOTG should have won the best makeup/hairstyling Oscar just for Drax alone :O
Sorry about my double post. I spelled Ponyvengers wrong. &gt;.&gt;
Ponyvengers Assemble! Yeah! From last year, never posted it. Oops! on @DeviantArt http://t.co/CpCbEaraQK
My cats love it when my friends visit. Attention for everyone!
I’m entering to win @TheMarySue’s Hyperbole and a Half Stationery set giveaway so I can #WriteAllTheThings! http://t.co/BgnjbmGf6n
Hey, @EdmontonExpo know what would be awesome? Guests from The 100. :D
The thing I'll miss the most about going back to work after 6 weeks off: naps. So many naps.
(In non gaming news, I'm drawing a little. yay)
I'd like to just condescendingly pat these kids on the head and tell them it'll be OK. :D
Oh, poor boo boo. Did I ruin your combo?
I play Hearthstone, and there's a class of players I call Hearthstone Babies. They concede on the 2nd/3rd turn if they can't ROFLSTOMP you.
OMG @wilw posted my valentine from a couple of years back &lt;3 
He has the original.

I also did one of Worf. http://t.co/0Py3v0WlXD
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Herpasaurus derp. #herpderp Warm up sketch to get the sillies out. http://t.co/0szTytLDPs
I drew these on my flight a couple of weeks ago. One flight attendant gave me SO MANY SNAX. Delta wins. So many nuts. http://t.co/YMN1thoEH7
Star Wars Rebels Sketch Cards, done for Topps in late Jan. I love Zeb :D http://t.co/NG7f37bm4h
At MAGFest I met cute animal peeps. I'm laidup for a few weeks so I may draw some of you sometime and not as generic. http://t.co/EhgthyAv4L
The left shark is the only part of the superbowl that I watched.
Left shark is my new spirit animal. I'll scan this later. #iamleftshark #weareallleftshark http://t.co/buSUlcvpcf
I posted 3 photos on Facebook in the album "Star Wars Rebels" http://t.co/BFfr4qaW4e
My cats tried to unlock my laptop, presumably to order catnip using my credit card. http://t.co/bYmnekorpJ
They know the human is a captive audience. http://t.co/qMaJxgKH3F
I hear there's a sportsball game today. I need snacks!
OK, this is nice. http://t.co/razliaNhNk
Someone please come with a sharpie and do this to my cast. http://t.co/52TDGp3P5f
Friends are helping me set up a bedroom office tomorrow.
Attention twitterverse - I have broken my foot. Badly. I can't get to my office to get art to work on, so there may be some tablet art!
This was my whole bag! No hoodies, but do much awesome. No more @jinx 4 a bit unless they have a sale for Canadians http://t.co/NZy9aa0zEK
Construction dude (let's call him Steve) is helping me build my micro Minecraft set I got in my @JINX mysterious bag http://t.co/Nc6TKx42vL
Back in Canada! Going to churn out some sketch cards and how to my day job this weekend. Aw yeah!
My flight was cancelled, but I got rerouted. Have some ponies I drew at #MAGFest13 in the tea room. http://t.co/drXjFd5puO
Managed to lose a headphone padding somehow. To the Internet! I'm so tired. http://t.co/iiyyLdkZ3z
I had an amazing time at my first #MAGFest - made new friends, hugged old ones, rebooted my nerd and art programs. 2015 will be awesome!
Angry Brony is actually very nice, Dota removes the magic of friendship apparently.
I think this is clearer. #MAGFest13 http://t.co/aYwgC4Ml93
Aw yeah, @Protomen #MAGFest13 http://t.co/KRWeOvFgpW
We're having a little room party before Protomen! Fun with pals. #magfest13
