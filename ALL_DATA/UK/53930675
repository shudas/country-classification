*reading 19 days*  u can feel the yaoi coming like a freight train in the distance
ok so i just found out theres a transguy in DA:I and now i'm in tears i don't know why i'm crying
before I even played Dragon Age I was in love with Fenris, now before I play Inquisition I'm in love with Dorian haha haa
I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS IT I THINK IM GONNA SIDE WITHE THE MAGES
QUICK SHOULD I SIDE WOTH TEMPLARS OR MAGES IM SO CONFLICTED I ALSO HAVE A not taking sides option
so are people shipping Barry and Oliver or is that just me
I killed Danarius then we made out again #progress
how do accounts do that it's actually amazing http://t.co/AM2tfraGZi
my Anders is being so rude to everyone, especially Fenris like woah jealous much
watch ur mouth boy or I'll kick your teeth in
I had sympathy for Gamlen until he said (when talking about my relationship with Fenris)"I don't need to ask who the girl is"
Fenris and Varric banter is amazing, since act 3 it's been non-stop hilarious and light hearted. I love them together, I'm never changing
"... but I won't do THAT" *guitar solo*
"If you're mean about mages and wont help Anders you can get a lot more friendship points with Fenris" *I Would Do Any Thing For Love plays*
like I can't kill him and the thought of him betraying me is heartbreaking, I'll probably just throw my disk into the sun
I'm terrified at the thought of not getting enough friendship points with Fenris and so he's gonna betray me at the end
My dream was legit just me playing DA and fighting baddies lmfao
I didn't feel like an outcast
Someone said something to be tonight's that made me so happy I cried
I love Saturdays because that's when's I'm most at my 'genderfluidness'💪🏼this was between about 4… https://t.co/cKKNXzBt6G

I will starting tomorrow ok
twitter changed its message number thing so I can't tweet in as much
Why don't I use this anymore
That was an unexpected rant
like this time your daughter is staying in this phase mom ok leave me alone it's not a phase it's lyfe
idk you'd understand when you see my sisters at my age, they knew it was coming but idk if them knew im sticking with it
or laid back?
I'm very grateful and very very lucky so shout out to my fam, I hope everyone's family can eventually be as accepting as mine
I've never came out as anything I've just gradually found myself and my family are like k whatever and adapting to it
and honestly no one has said anything, my mum sometimes says I look too severe with my head shaved and my dads hates my drawn on eyebrows😂
I'm not really out to my fam but everyone's so laid back like my sister have had girlfriends and I dress like a boy
I just burst some blood vessels under my eye and put sudocreme on it why I thought it would help I have no idea
What a wonderful princess
Aurora is so elegant and beautiful omfg
Always a fucking argument with these people
No wonder I recognized it when I was 13
Just found out from my mum that I must've watch The Labyrinth when I was 5 or 6

I'm better at avoiding words in real life than on the Internet which isn't quite good yet
I think I'm getting better at using less ablest language, and when I slip up I always try and correct myself.
...was very cute because I can see this getting very homosexual" like gURL do u think I'd use 'gay' as an offensive word
"the way he tried not to giggle at a compliment from a man and then in an attempt to compose himself but blatantly blushing...
I said "that's pretty gay earlier"  someone was like "you shouldn't say 'gay' you should say 'stupid' or smth" I was ok lemme rephrase that
I don't condone smoking lads just fyi

"ae tho" is an actual sentence that makes sense
I'm not going out anymore, I always end up upset
If I could turn back time and decide against going out last night I would do it in a heartbeat
I'm gonna throw up
I'm fucking shaking with anger
fuck it i'll put it in anyways
i'm laughing cause it's so fuckin stupid and irrelevant
when you're making a playlist for a pairing but you're in love with this one song even though it's totally not relevant at all to the ship
I wanna hear Gideon Emery sneeze
hmmmmblocking out the haters
they're are good things about fandoms and I'm grateful for it
I mean I've watched my cousin play the first DA and I've only just ordered DA2 so like yeah thanks fandoms
it's cool
I'm currently cosplays Fenris and reading fenhawke, have I played the game? nope
like I ship Mulder and Scully but I don't watch X files like yeah ok
I think that's pretty cool
I know lots of people who ship Sterek and Destiel, and cosplay and write fanfics and they dont even watch it
tumblr makes you ship something you have never even played/watched/read
