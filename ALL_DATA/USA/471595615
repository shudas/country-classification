The only thing I have motivation to do is eat
16 more days of school💆
"Your butt cheeks are like loaves of bread"- @logan_aaron96 to @aubswats 😅🍞🍞
Ready for Monday morning😎
It'd be a lot easier to order swim suits if it was guaranteed that I'd look like the model in the picture.
So proud of my boy and the rest of his team at the meet tonight☺️
I love looking at pictures of everyone's pretty prom dresses☺️💃
Ask me about my summer bod http://t.co/VFxoOxaGLP
HOW IS IT ONLY MONDAY😭🔫
So beyond excited for summer😍
Can't get away from a good time
So excited to see The Longest Ride😍
A part of me doesn't want any tattoos, but another part of me wants to be covered in them.
I love getting pedicures😍😌💅
Getting in bed and realizing I forgot to put in my retainer is the worst😩
He's so bad, but he does it so well🎶
And just lay low
I love listening to storms😌☔️⚡️
Days spent with @KKKKAAATTEE are days well spent☺️
"Is ancestry in Arkansas called incestry?"- @BodenW
Being able to drive to school with the windows down🙌😍
H8 my phone
I would give anything to be at the K today
As if my sleeping schedule wasn't messed up before, this weekend sure hasn't helped anything
Anything you say can and will be held against you, so only say my name🎶
The Theory of Everything breaks my heart into sad little tiny pieces
Taco Bell is my best friend
Thank God for tumblr
"I accidentally just typed in porn"
"You fell in love with my flowers but not with my roots, so when autumn arrived you didn't know what to do"
Social networks get pretty boring in the a.m.
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expected
"Extra inch..just like that iPhone 6" @HeyFuller 😂
You were that whiskey runnin' through my veins🎶
The 1975 on the record player, I think I've died and gone to hipster heaven💙
Haleigh's church is so awesome❤️
Been cutting my own bangs since the 6th grade💇
Overuse I love you🎶💕
I regret cutting my hair off daily😞
Thank god for headphones. 🎧
H8 today
Can I just lay in bed &amp; listen to the storm instead of going to school?☔️⚡️

My best friend is famous guys. http://t.co/TwBuk2yDW7
Sometimes I think I'm excited to go to college, other times I think dropping out doesn't sound that bad
Getting way too comfortable with not wearing makeup in public😅
God is so good.
River Monsters is my fav
Quality time with @HeyFuller never gets old❤️
My car is such a mess😅😂
My stubbornness always ends up biting me in the ass
How about you stop tweeting everyone.
Squad up never roll alone🎶
So thankful to have such an amazing boyfriend☺️💕 #mushytweet
Best night I've had in a while
Not today satan
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquorrr🎶
I will own a motorcycle one day
I always wait way too long to get trims🙈💇
Being sick sucks😒👍
When I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Jealous of everyone with naturally dark eyelashes
Can I be done with math forever
As if being at home sick doesn't suck enough, then you get to do all of the bullshit homework you missed🎈
I guess some things just don't mix like you hope
I just want to go to a concert
I LOVE STORMS
I will never understand how some people don't like to read.📚
I could listen to The 1975 forever
It actually really pisses me off when people text and drive
Huge S/O to @KKKKAAATTEE for being the only person that talks to me and is able to put up with me❤️
Live how you want to
Bed time
All coming back to school today has done for me is make me remember how much I hate everyone
I don't even remember how to school
My skin is in desperate need of a tan..😅
Love you baby, like a wrecking ball🎶
I would rather stab both of my eyes out with a fork than go back to school tomorrow
Can we get another spring break plz
Tired and cranky and ready to be home😣
I love the rain☔️
Regret is by far one of the worst feelings.
Happiness don't drag its feet
And time moves faster than you think
The process of trying to grow your eyebrows out is never pretty
Very tempted to just watch all of the seasons of OITNB again
So sad Wilson's spring break isn't the same as mine
Once you start watching Dance Moms you can't stop
Ready for this kind of weather everyday🌞
It already feels so nice outside😍
