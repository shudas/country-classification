SA is the most popular country in Africa and instead of helping it's fellow Africans,  they are killing them? Nice #AfricansAgainstAfricans

Watching @TheOddCoupleCBS at work.  No volume but still cracking up reading the subtitle #BestNewComedyShow http://t.co/cUkOSXY7NM
I can't believe I am going to  say this but I am in love with Drake's new Album....
Really proud of my boys #SportingKC #OnlySportsIActuallyGet 

Night
#FutureGoal: Buy a three bedroom home, with 2 and half bath. A huge finished basement and a two door garage.  Oh and a beautiful backyard üòè
#PerceptionTNT  was one of the best show. It made you think.  Their acting was great
I have 2 shows on that chanel #RizzoliandIsles and #MajorCrimes and thats the only reason I am still watching that chanel. #Irritated
I'm done watching anymore shows on #TNT. I can't believe they cancelled #Perception too. I think they need to get their shit together
Whatever happened between The Wanted,  at least none of them played shady and did what  Zayn did. #TWFanmily
Just be happy
I need to know why Rags hates Suhani so much? Can someone tell me? #suhanisiekladki #Starplus
I am going to go and watch me some @CW_TheFlash
Seriously. The Voice this guy has... #Brilliant Nathan Sykes - More Than You'll Ever Know: https://t.co/S4pTq0uNz0 via @YouTube
That's why I going to continue to listening to my radio station from now. Can't handle with stupidity anymore. #VentingOver
Now I really want Nathan Sykes to go big so I can see all these fake people kissing ass.
Btw how do you work on a radio station and DON'T KNOW WHO THE WANTED ARE? Have never heard of this little song called GLAD YOU CAME? (+)
And he has a great voice and has a new album out. So if you are going to say something at least know what you are talking about
I have met Nathan and he was really sweet. Compared to a couple of his band mates who I liked more than him, he was actually sweeter (+)
Ariana his "friend". Oh please. I don't she even remembers your name.
if you don't know what you are talking about. Also it sounded more like the dude was mad that Nathan got to date Ariana. Which he called (+)
and then the main host talks about how he will sleep well since Nathan isn't making music. Are effin kidding me? LIke don't talk shit (+)
the radio hosts talkin shit on Nathan Sykes from the Wanted. Like they had no good reason besides the fact that he "yelled" at 1 of them (+)
#TimeToVent: So my radio station has a commercial so I decide to switch stations so I don't fall asleep while driving. So What do I hear (+)
Dear @CW_TheFlash does this mean Cisco doesn't have to die?
Ok I think I am done. This was fun twitter. Let's do it again üòÜ
I really want to either write a book on my family or do a documentary of my travel to Europe this year.
Twitter is cool for famous ppl &amp; regular people use it to keep up with their favorite celebs. Cuz we know no one really cares what we think
I have been listening to #WomenOfJazz and #WomeOfPopAndRock on #Spotify I just didn't realize I knew so many old songs.
Oh BTW, Paula Poundstone was brilliant on @waitwait along with Amy Dickinson and Roy Blount, Jr. When will you guys come to Kansas City?
I think I am getting the hang of this.
Another good question. When will #Bones be back? If I am not wrong it's been FOREVER since it's been on.  #ExaggeratingABit
Speaking of Dean, when will we see Sam and Dean being in an actual lasting relationships?  #BoysAreGettingOld #NeedSomeoneToCarryOnTheLegacy
Im actually more excited for #Supernatural to be back on. I really feel bad for Dean. All he wanted to do is safe the world.  Or America LOL
And how excited I am for @CW_TheFlash to finally be back on. It's been too long.  #WhatIsTheDealWithTheYellowFlash #IsHeReverseFlash?
Or I can just talk about how completely sad it was watching Huck tell his story of being that hole. #Scandal @guillermodiazyo was #Brilliant
Do I stalk one person at a time or just scroll down my feed?  #TwitterConfusion
I don't even remember how this thing is used loool #TwitterConfusion
Does it mean I have a life now or I don't have a life because I haven't been on twitter for a long time?  #Workaholic
The world is full of negativity, that's why I like to appreciate all the little happy moments.  #PeaceAndLove
Goodnight

So I just found out Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder are a couple.  Hmm, I guess this means I'm old. #BehindOnLatestGossip
Just read @ddlovato was rushed to the hospital.  I hope she is doing better.  She seems really kind and wish a quick recovery
In my feelings. I honest to got need a break from everything and everyone. #Stressed #NeedAVacation
#IveSeenEveryEpisodeOf #NCIS, #Supernatural, #Castle, #CriminalMinds, #TheMentalist #Bones #TheFlash #Scandal #WantedWednesday And many more
Ok now it's time for bed. Night world. In the words of the great Ellen Degeneres "be kind to one another"
Oh PS. I am in love with John Legend and Common ' s song #Glory
I am THE definition of minority. I am black. I am a Muslim. I am a woman. I am an immigrant. Oh I am short? Lol #Oscars
One day there will be a #KCCon so the cast of @cw_spn can come. #SupernaturalToKansasCity please?
[+] &amp; everything else but as soon as a woman complains ppl have to tell her she is whining. As a working woman I support #PatriciaArquette üíØ
If you actually think #PatriciaArquette has no right to feel oppressed then you're out of your mind. How come we fight for religion, race[+]

Best part of the #Oscars was all the empowering speeches. From equal wages for women to treating Blacks with "true" equality to treating [+]
Matthew Perry's new show #TheOddCouple looks promising. It's really funny
Who ever started that stupid hashtag about Neymar is beyond evil. He has family and friends and fans. Why mess with people like that? #Sick
How hard is it for people to just say Thank You? I mean I know this is the person's job but a thank you will not kill you. #RespectAllPeople
Many ppl are calling Olivia Pope ungrateful but I think she is 100% right. She sacrificed for Fitz and he just threw it all away #Scandal
Sad. My show is over. #TheMentalist
Tonight's episode of @Castle_ABC was one of the best. Like the acting by @Stana_Katic @NathanFillion and the rest of the cast was BRILLIANTüòç

I want to go back to UK Sweden and Italy. See family. Sightseeing.  Museums.  And of course food. ‚úàüöû
#HappyNote : I am definitely going to Europe next year #InshaAllah
I don't even care for marriage but the restrictions aren't helping the whole situation.
Hearing parents talk about interracial marriages is pretty much the most annoying thing in this world #YouChoseYoursLetYourKidsChooseTheirs
On a side note my 27th birthday is coming up in two days and I got carded at the movie theater trying to watch #TopFiveMovie #MyLife üòÇüòÇ
Seriously though even if you don't celebrate Christmas, gotta love 25th of December for the fact that EVERYONE in the family sees each other
"@LizzyTW_: @Izza4Life hahaha well let's hope your dream comes true in a future xD" It would be a great excuse to visit üòÅ
This week's #NCIS was literally one of the best. @PauleyP @M_Weatherly @SeanHMurray You guys made me laugh and cry in one episode. #GreatJob
üòí http://t.co/mToTTBG7Cg
I need a vacation asap
So #Billboard did an article on The Wanted and One Direction only to diss The Wanted. If only they knew how #TWFanmily feel about our boys
"@Running_Girl85: @Izza4Life Take me to #England with you. You can pack me in your suitcase. I may be tall but I'm bendy."Sure. Why not? Lol
Next year, God willing, I'm going to Europe.  I need a vacation.  I need to start saving up to make it happen.  #England #Sweden #italy
