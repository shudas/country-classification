If you are a man playing a tough sport and you are acting like a bitch and being soft. I will probably call you poofter or faget! Fuck it!
I grew up in a world where. I called people retarded. Gay, dumb, stupid, hopeless and none of my friends got offended.
I don't pray to a magical being. I work hard and practice sport. My abilities? I get from my parents. My success? I get,because I earned it!
