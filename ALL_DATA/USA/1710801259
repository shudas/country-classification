You were afraid
I got freckles so fuck your tattoos
Hahaaaaaa funny how time just keeps speeding up faster faster everyday
Hiccups hiccups hiccups
And now I say welcome back gloomy skies! Long time no see 😁
Today's weather is a blessing 👼
At least today is going by fast right?
Welcome to the jungle punk
Tomorrow's the day...back to the old grind 😕
Gettin closer and closer to summer everyday baby 😆😎
Do we go back to school Monday or Tuesday?
Feeling like absolute garbage
Everyone is chillin under this amazing breeze
Sleep is an enemy
The wind blowin through my hair feels greater than any gal or gent brushin across the buzz 😎🔮
I'm ready to go swimming
Vomit
Stomach...pain...😣
The power of the aux cord
So many people turned into assholes this past year...what happened??
It's not even May yet and the farmers tan game is getting real

Fishing would be pretty sweet right now
This mattress will never be left alone tonight 😌😴

You cannot just simply throw gatorade in your cart or else you get some strange flavor like cucumber 😒
Every sunday night I can never sleep 😐

It's a sin to drive your own car without music playing

Woke up, thought it was friday, picked up my phone, disapointment :(
You are so stupid it's painful
Damn you spend more hours of your life sleeping than being awake
It's only been a year since I got my license but it feels like 5
If there is another vine I see playing rocketship I will play in traffic
I swear it feels like a Thursday
This new OGT schedule is bogus
Music would at least make this day suck a little less but sleep is that evil
Ya don't have to be a troll
What kind of american doesn't stand for the pledge!
Gonna be a loooooooooooooooooong day
I'm literally gonna want to snap somebody's neck when I wake up in the morning
How pathetic are people who verbally rape us with talking?
Anyone who has Slak whose a real G would understand the suffering I am going through right now
You're the biggest jackoff @bkarpinec

A lot of assholes on the road today
Slept a lot and still tired, what is life?
I am not proud of myself for spending $20 on a pair of sucks
Fuck this train dude
They crowned the sun
The things I see on my timeline just get more stupid everyday
Like a drum baby don't stop beatin
I'm not one to complaign about my job but it's annoying as hell when the boss dicks around
Wow it's hard to keep my eyes open

Getting tired of feeling like I have 200Ibs of fatass sitting on my chest when I breathe
Happy birthday man @S_Misch
Not being able to use emojis is like not being able to shower
Studying, you can kiss my ass. Netflix, here I come!
