Rough week for #quinte region.
Finished season 1 of Marco Polo. Now to check out season 1 of house of cards.
So who hosts the Parade if Bulls happen to pull an upset in the #OHL playoffs? Hamilton going to get that too?
If this is true, the city is making a mistake. Rumour is ProShop is closing at @QSWC why is in not being converted into a new shop?

It is time for new leadership in Canada. #cdnpoli http://t.co/oWNOdUzRoA the Harper government is destroying our country
If a city councillor is going to make allegations as made today he should present the facts. My 2 cents anyways.
