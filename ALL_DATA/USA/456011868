Finding who your supposed to be and who others want you to be is the biggest struggle in life.
So many life decisions to make rn and I'm more interested in hiding in a hole. 🙈

You live in my soul
Your heart is my goal

Accepting the fact you will be absent in my life is something I can never do.
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars✨
As long as I get that, sweet little something late night kiss. 🎶
If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never to far apart 🎶
