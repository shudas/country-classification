Today i finished the fairy tale piece and learnt to NEVER post comments on Facebook (I'm still new to this ).
Sunday is sit at your desk and write about fairy tales all day until Snow White and Cinderella are basically Pinocchio.

Despite the score and less than 40% possession. Tigers are hanging in there. #NRLWarriorsTigers
