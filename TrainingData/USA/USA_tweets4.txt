I must say it scares me to no end but at the same time I'm more than okay with it
You could do the worst possible thing to me yet I would still continue to love you. I will never stop loving you.

She then disappeared before my eyes. I woke up, uneasy. Almost hollow.
I had a dream last night involving love with someone if never seen before. Love the likes I had never felt before.

In case you're hunting for a free agent to scout for your team, by the way: Arcobello, on a league minimum deal, has fifteen goals.
The Coyotes have a couple players that, at the very least, earned a PTO next year. That was a much better game
John Moore with two pointsDave Moss with two goalsMark Arcobello with two goals and an assist. Now has fifteen goals this year
ARCO-BELIEVE IT!!! *rally howl*Coyotes take home two points, while @sporkabella takes home three points of his own
Shout out to Dave Moss, John Moore, and Mark Arcobello for all having multi point games, though #ARIvsDET
Coyotes get a point, but more importantly, the Coyotes score four goals in a game. Can't remember the last time I said that.
Coyotes are playing a very Buffalo-esque game here. Can't hold a lead in this game #ARIvsDET
Kings, stop doing the thing please
Coyotes up again! Gorgeous goal from Dahlbeck. That trade deadline is looking prettier by the game #ARIvsDET
Arizona getting outshot by triple is certainly something, btw. May have something to do with this tie score.
Mike Smith doing Mike Smith things, though. Clever turnaround and its 2-2, still a tie game. #ARIvsDET
MARCOBELLO!!! six goals with the coyotes, fourteen on the season. #EliteJourneyman

I feel like I got competition
Tbh I hope it rains
Friday, where you at?
Fuck today
Don't get my hopes up
Forget Florida, I've had enough of it to last me a lifetime.
I could spend my whole life biking, hiking, and adventuring through canyons, mountains, forests, caves, ect.
Life is good.
Candid!!! https://t.co/tl0QzSZfVD
Really excited to go to Colorado later this week :)
Tanning while also strategically covering the spots were I'm sunburnt.
The pink jeep tour was incredible http://t.co/guwjZeCiwX
I miss my friends
Pretty sure I'd be willing to give up a limb to go back to the botanical garden I visited earlier.
There's a bookstore right across the street from our hotel so I walked over there and they were shut down :(
I could have stayed in those greenhouses and picked out cacti and succulents for hours but my mom made me leave ;'((((

soooo glad I'm not stuck in indiana on spring break :)
Personally I thought the insurgent movie was better than the divergent movie by a wiiiiiide margin
Nothing in the world that's better than classic rock
I'm the queen at overpacking, I've already packed like half my closet ughhhh
Whenever I'm right next to someone and I'm thinking stuff about them I get scared because I'm like "WHAT IF THEY CAN READ MINDS"
Study...Sleep....Study....Sleep....Study....
Debating whether it would be more beneficial to continue studying now or to get some sleep and wake up to study in the morning...
In a perfect world, I would be able to get in bed and watch ohshc for the rest of the night and skip school tomorrow.
I love how my friends and I always go to movie premiers :)
classical music is actually super great
My whole family is crying .
I don't like being called princess. My parents used to call me that so it's weird
Moral of the story, don't buy cars without your parents kids.
They boys looked so embarrassed
And was yelling at everyone telling us she doesn't want it. And that the kids got a bad deal. And she was heated. And yelling so loud
Some young guys came into my work and bought a car today, and when they got home I'm guessing there mom was mad bc she came up there
The idea is fun .
This dj sucks
I thought it was going to break my windshield, but it bounced right over us. And I think that's the coolest thing that's happened to me .
And one of those huge ass exercise balls flew out, and it was bouncing towards us. And we both just stared at it .
One time me and Pheebs were driving on the freeway, and the truck in front of us had furniture in the back
I don't wanna go
Every high up person from the entire corporation will be at my dealership today, and if that's not nerve wrecking idk what is.
Why do some girls get to be so flawless
Do you ever get depressed just by looking at someone's pictures.
I wish I was 21 so I could be an Uber driver

Don't speak unless spoken to. Guess some people's parents didn't teach them that!!!
Time to take my frustration out on cleaning the inside of my car
Time to take a break from cleaning. To clean up and go to a work meeting. Then back at it. #cleanfreak #cleaning #busybee

Where's my stoner boyfriend?
I do my homework and get stoned
I'm embarrassed for you
Almost everyone's snapchat story annoys me for some reason. It's just hard to watch 100+ seconds of you walking around your house or talking
We might be drifting
stay stoney
Tonight you're gonna have so much fun while tastin my love; tell me do you have a taste for vanilla wafers?
When your friend is too stoned to torch you up
Dabs that make you have to lay down immediately
My humps my humps my humps my lovely lady lumps
Don't be my friend if you disagree with me :)
In my opinion, if you fuck someone I've already slept with, you're not my friend. You're a dirty whore that likes sloppy seconds.
If I consider you my friend, you should know without me having to tell you: don't fuck the current or past men in my life. Period.
Sometimes you're too much.
when you have to turn the tv volume up because your munching is too loud
I can't hear anything over the stupidity that's coming out of your mouth
Is it pathetic that I still wait for your text...
I don't even know what happened after one little change everything changed
You look like a pizza roll but I lowkey love pizza rolls
Idk why guys still think it's cute to wear a bow tie and suspenders with jeans and vans. And then call it "formal"

You gave up on me a year ago but I never gave up on you.
If you got the chance to meet me again to go back to the beginning tell me you would, and that this time we would do it right.
My relationship with my mom is honestly so messed up and I just really wish she would take some responsibility.
Silly me actually thinking my mom and I would hang out tomorrow. I should really  know better by now.
What should I order from Dutch?
Makaylas gay
What I don't understand is how come every time me and my dad have plans they're more important to me than to him. Like he can just cancel.
