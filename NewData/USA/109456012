I'm amped....#NBAPlayoffs
So that's that...#NBAPlayoffs
The @ATLHawks and @Cavs are chilling until Saturday or Sunday....#NBAPlayoffs
#Bulls would finish 3rd if they win final game vs @ATLHawks Wed Night..which would keep Raptors 4th #NBAPlayoffs
If @Raptors win last 2gms (vs @Celtics &amp; @Hornets) they'll clinch 3rd Seed...#NBAPlayoffs
#Wizards win tonight vs Pacers and tomorrow night vs @Cavs..w/ @Raptors loss vs @Hornets Wed Night..Wiz get 3rd seen..#NBAPlayoffs
Now, the @Bucks are stuck at 6th...could open on road vs either 3seed Bulls or Raptors..#NBAPlayoffs
The @ATLHawks Clinched 1st Seed...@Cavs 2nd #NBAPlayoffs
The Nets are in w/ Win vs Magic Wed Night and Pacers loss both vs Wizards &amp; Grizz...@Pacers own tie-breaker over Nets #NBAPlayoffs
The @Pacers are in w/ win tonight and tomorrow night vs Grizz..#NBAPlayoffs
The #HeatNation won't get in..even tho they are still alive theoretically...
Owt East...everything is basically set...#NBAPlayoffs
That would suck becuz then becuz we won't see Grizz vs #Clippers in 1st Rd...#NBAPlayoffs
The #Clippers stay at 3 if they win tonight..and could move up to 2nd if Spurs, Rockets lose their last game...#NBAPlayoffs
Still pissed about that loss last night @Trailblazers...
The @TrailBlazers are stuck at 4th..but will open on road becuz 5th seed will have a better record..5th seed will be Grizz, Rockets or Spurs
If that happens, @Spurs will have won 8 of possible 11 Southwest Division titles since realignment...#NBAPlayoffs
The @Spurs has upper hand on Southwest...win vs #Pelicans Wed Clinches 5th straight title and 2nd seed owt West #NBAPlayoffs
#Grizzlies basically loss the division last night, so they'll be at 6th..becuz Rockets won tie-breaker and Clippers will beat @Suns Tonight
OKC win..w/ #Pelicans loss..#Thunder vs @Warriors Sunday Night...#NBAPlayoffs
If @PelicansNBA Win..they're in..#NBAPlayoffs
Lets get into it...#NBAPlayoffs
2Days left in the @NBA regular season....
