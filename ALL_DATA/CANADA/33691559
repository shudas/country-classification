I remember the #Oilers never bothered with the "sea of ..."  and just were the loudest, liveliest building in the NHL. Never in Rex again.
I've seen it. And didn't freak out.
I'm more stoked for the new #StarWars trailer than the playoffs. #OilerFanProblems
And...we have already seen the last playoff game at Rexall. June 17, 2006. At least we won. #Oilers
So the new building will have been proposed, fought over, shovels into the ground to fully built. All while the #Oilers are an embarrassment
I predict @NHLBlackhawks will win the @NHL #StanleyCup. Join the #NHLBracketChallenge http://t.co/rFsI0DvJgc
It's nearly become entrenched as tradition that no matter how hard the #Oilers suck, they will kick the shit out of the #Canucks at game 82.
I bet OKC will be glad to get half their team back. #Oilers
I dunno...wouldn't it be in Buffalo's best interest to have Pitt in the playoffs rather than give the #Oilers another percentage? #Imagine
Stone.
There is so much flames crap around here it makes me wanna puke.
How many points does Yak get if Eakins doesn't rob him of the first three months of the year? 40-45? #Oilers
That was some nice stick pro by Purcell to cause the turn over. #Oilers
This Brosiot kid is looking really good. Too bad we'll wreck him. #Oilers
Arcobello and Reider are on #Coyotes first line with Doan??? Did I read that right?? #ExplainsAlot
Dylan Strome just became a #Leaf.
I almost went to the #Oilers game. #Whew
Musil in tonight. This should be fun..#Oilers #BattleOfAlberta
Howard..the duck...#BadMovieGoodFriday
That goal let in by Mrazik in Detroit was reeeeeky. #Wings #Bruins
Looking for 2 tickets to the #Oilers game on Saturday. Coming in from Calgary. Mid level would be ideal.
Miller just scored a couldn't plan it better first ever #NHL goal. #Oilers
Omgomgomg!!!
Oh yeah. This is going to get nasty. #Oilers #Stars
That was some fun shit. #Oilers
When Reg Dunlop leaves the owners house in #SlapShot that has to be one of the most vicious burns in movie history. "Your son looks like.."
If there's a god (there isn't), the #Sabres and #Coyotes will go to OT with Buffalo winning. #Oilers
I am vigorously keeping track of the #Sabres #Coyotes game. #OilerFanProblems
The #Avs play a very framiliar form of defense...
In what universe does Dubnyk ever come back willingly to the #Oilers ?
The Coyotes are 3 points behind the #Oilers and have beaten the oil 5 times. Really.
I miss TSN. That is all. #Oilers
Abdelkader just scored with a broken stick. #NHL #Wings
Still need a goalie though. Since Dwayne @$&amp;"(! Robison left we've needed a goalie. #Oilers
Is it possible this line is for real? #Oilers
Teaching a friend about #Twitter. #ComputerRetarded
What I learned this lunch break - @wheelingprobs is garbage. And my coffee cup won't come clean. #ProductiveDay
Today is the kind of day where I spend an hour cleaning my coffee cup. #FridayProblems
Jon Stewart just killed it. Killed it. #Classic
Call me cynical, but when I wonder what became of so and so from high school, I instantly figure they became meth heads. #WhitecourtProblems
I think we better start getting to know Noah Hannifin a lot better. #Oilers
Ha!! Kadri gets 4 games and all the idiots in leaf land were convinced he wouldn't get any. "But but but..." #Shutup
The refs chose not to get a handle on things and kick Kadri out, and now this. Way to go #NHL.
We want Ten!! #TooSoon ? #Oilers
The ultimate warrior music needs to be retired forever. #Oilers
The #leafs are going to be shown the REAL #tanknation tonight. The #Oilers gonna be oilerin' hard. #TheyDontEvenKnow
This wind can piss off anytime. #SandBlast
Patrick Sharp just scored a goal scorers goal. #Blackhawks
They definitely kill off Han Solo in the next Star Wars. Random thought I had while watching 42.
The refs apparently not on board with the Tank. #Oilers
Couldn't even wait until I sat down, huh #Oilers?
Something that was just realized - the #Oilers made the playoffs just once in my 30s. The Run.
Whatever happens now, this was a gutsy comeback. #Oilers
There's still a chance... #Oilers #LoosyGoosy
It's gotten to the point for me, after soooo-uhsooo much losing, if we don't get #McDavid, I'll not have much left for the #Oilers.
One thing I'll say about #Taber - they don't know shit without corn.
Wow everything I need to have happen in the #Leafs #Sabres game has happened. Let's go Buffalo now!!! #OilerNation
Soooo that happened... #Oilers
When I watch hockey hi lights now, I'm secretly trying to decide if I could cheer another team. Window shopping. #Oilers #MaybeNotOilers
Once Klefbom picks a real number I'll get his jersey. #84isntAnumber
Look at it this way #Oilers fans. We will either get the best centre, the second best centre, or the best D-man In the draft. #ItsAllGood
Klefbom leads all players from either team in ice time. And has looked great. #Oilers
Ironically, the #Oilers could end up looking not so dumb for not giving up on #Yak.
So when McDavid doesn't go to the Leafs, watch the Toronto media quit caring.
Definition of being an #Oilers fan these days...watching and reading all Edm media fall over themselves to slam each other. #OilerFanProblem
Watch Jimmy Kimmel Call Out Anti-Vaxxers in Scathing Monologue http://t.co/3dCOaEx2zE via @rollingstone
I'm taking hockey off this weekend and watching #HouseofCardsSeason3 starting...now.
The dress was #goldandwhite . That is all.
Gotta admit...that dress pic threw me off. #StrangeDays
Nope. Not calling Pouliot Poo. Except to say I won't call him that. #Oilers
Is there something wrong with me if I like to spend up to 10 minutes reading a celebrity responding to a troll tweet? #CantLookAway
Alright Hamilton! Not.  http://t.co/OpKY3H6uyK
It's not really a shock the #Oilers look lifeless. Seasons long over, but still almost 2 months to go. These are the proverbial dog days.
That goal happened so quick I got the goal alert on my phone before the game start alert. #Oilers
Huh? Wha? How there? #BecauseOilers
I will NEVER get sick of seeing that Malik shootout goal. #Dirty
Gentlemen...you can't fight here! This is the war room!
I #VoteRichards in the TSN #Tradecentre poll. How about you? http://t.co/GihopY6cMt
So a website I never check is changing the names of stats I don't care about. But my Twitter feed won't stop talking about it.
What I just discovered...The greatest goal song of all time is...Capricorn Sister by Mother love Bone. The 24 second mark, to be precise.
These totally homer announcers for the #Caps have made me switch to going for the #Pens .
Yakkkkk!!!! #Oilers
Wow
LANDER!!!! #notYak
I love my timeline after a Yak goal. We all seem to cheer a little louder when he scores. #Oilers #YakAttack
No goaltender in history would help there. #BecauseOilers
The #Oilers ...without a starting goaltender since Roloson. Nothing helps a tank job better than incompetent goaltending.
Is Fleury really singing on my TV? #ValentinesDayMassacre
A Sun News channel must be as horrible as it sounds.
Klefbom is a pure beast. So there's that... #Oilers
Col. Klink might be my new fave #Oiler
That's a trip, but Ebs is getting waaaay too predictable with that toe drag. #Oilers
Didn't we get the #Habs backup last game too? #Oilers
We're at the point of the year where wins are pretty good, and losses are pretty good. #Oilers
Lowe is gonna show his face? #Oilers
So Yak gets nailed hard, gets stitched up, and comes back to score? There may be a hockey player in there yet. #Oilers
I'd actually be worried if Healy called him a first line centre. #HealyLogic #WrongIsRight
Uhhhhggg...Healy. #Oilers
The most fire power we'll see all night maybe... #Zing #Goilers
We're winning this. Straight up. #Oilers
The game will be an abortion, but Twitter will be hysterical tonight. #Oilers #Leafs #SomebodyHasToWin
