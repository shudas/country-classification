IT'S FRIDAY.... WAHOOOOOOOO 😊🍺🍷🍷🍹🍸*jumps around room*
Today I grew some metaphorical balls and told my job I was quitting. #abouttime
As of next week me &amp; @Wilson92B will be a fruit packers 🍏🍎🍏🍒🍓🍋🍐🍍 $$$ #travel #adventure #Oz
In hindsight I probably should have spent the last 10 weeks working a job that actually paid me a base wage. 🙈 doh.  #skint #travel
This Easter weekend has just been top notch 👌
'The Roast of Justin Bieber' - hilarious 😂
Of course the one day I come into work drunk is the day I have to work with my boss. 🙈 *hiccup*
7 am meetings 😴😴😴😴
Last night I either insulted you or made out with you. 🙈 #mess
The hangover I'm currently experiencing is definite confirmation I took full advantage of the free bar last night. 🙊😷😴
I'm gutted I'm not going to watch the Grand Prix, however Sydney was soooo much fun.
Staying in a hotel tonight.. Not a hostel, A HOTEL! 🙌🙌 Yeyy. 💃💃💃
NO BEN HOWARD, NOOOOO 😫
At the Australian Open innocently eating a hotdog and a TV crew asked to film us eating them...… https://t.co/nAwE74EhAF

This afternoon will be dedicated to eating pizza &amp; watching Suits 👌 @Wilson92B

In other news.. Sat watching the tennis on a big screen outside this evening was just lovely 👌😊
This evening I was wrapped up in jeans, hoodie, leather jacket and scarf!! It was 17 degrees... I think I'm getting too used to hot weather.
About to take another RSA course - kill me now. 👎
I have a job!! 😊😊😊
The penguin parade on Phillip Island was amazing. - god those penguins were ADORABLE!
Off to see some Penguins - Yeyy. 🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧
I have and interview this afternoon - arghh I hate interviews 🙈
The only bad thing about moving cities is the long agonising process of finding a job &amp; doing interviews again.
Kids, there is a thing as too much Tequila. HANGING HELL!!
Just visited Ramsey street - it was as awesome as I've always imagined it would be! Haha http://t.co/J75DGS4iZq
Last night we experienced the worst hostel everrrr - I've never been so pleased to leave a place,
We had pancakes for breakfast, the sun is shinning and we're off to watch some Tennis - today is a good day. 🌞🎾😊 #AusOpen2015
We just treated ourselves to Beans on Toast. I'm talking woolies 69 cent beans.... What a treat. #lifeasapoorbackpacker @Wilson92B

Okay, so we've found the flaw in our lovely new hostel... We are right above a pub.. The music is so loud that our floor is vibrating. 🙈
Just moved into our new hostel.. Our new room is like luxury. 😍😍😍 @Wilson92B
This American woman now keeps asking me to say "Thank you" - the woman cray cray.
Listening to an American woman on the bus who is OBSESSED with her dogs - they have prams &amp; night lights. I AM IN HYSTERICS 😂😂
BYE SYDNEY 👋 http://t.co/qAhSEtwRnr
But for now it's back to the city... #Roadtrip http://t.co/WoT0lmGFhG
There are so many cute little villages in the Blue Mountains. - you could spend days exploring this place.
Such a fun day exploring the Blue Mountains. - I have super tired legs now though!
I'm drunk - I blame these two... They only came over for an hour!  🙈 http://t.co/mRXsHWPMXz
I'm so bored of hearing about people cheating on each other - how about if you want to fuck about you just be single! Pretty simple right?!
Doing my last shift for 'American Express' - as of 2pm I will officially be unemployed again. #travel #Australia
Starting to pack &amp; sort out the apartment = ball ache. 🙈
'Charlie Brooker's 2014 wipe' - hilarious.
I never trust a hair dresser with shit hair.
Flights and hostel booked for Melbourne - so excited to start the next part of our adventure 🌏🌏🌏
I think I'm getting an ear infection and my god IT FRIGGIN' HURTS 😭😩😞
Today's hangover was cured by an afternoon in the park having a BBQ and chilling in the sunshine. 👌🌞 Happy New year! http://t.co/bLru4OSIBo
I have had such a fun evening 👌🍷❤️ http://t.co/vNYPoY2cY4
'The Fault In our Stars' gets me every time... Oh my 😭😭😭
Currently without travel insurance... Oops. 🙈
I AM SO TIRED -  😴😴😴😴
Okay, maybe I'm being a bit dramatic...
Just missed my asos delivery... That's it CHRISTMAS IS RUINED.
I was going to tidy the apartment but I feel watching the 'Homeland' season finale is much more important.
Got loads of shit to get done but so far since I got home from work all I've done is lay on the floor. Doh.
Time to whip out abit of the 'Gavin &amp; Stacey Christmas special' 🎅🎄🙌
Lay on the beach listening to a live band singing Christmas songs... It's a weird combination...
Works done for the day, the weather is beautiful... For me this means one thing... BEACH TIME 🌞👌🌊
Forgot how much I enjoy listening to Howie Day. 👌
Watched @AxelWinterMusic do a set at Westfield earlier such a nice voice and I couldn't fault the song choices.  #topnotch
Restoring the little bit faith that I have in the human race. #SydneySiege http://t.co/XLYWKK8WkW
So weird that this hostage situation is going on just under 2 miles away from me. - god, I'm praying for those poor people. #sydneysiege
HOW AM I 23?!!!?????
The building I work in has now been locked and has guards outside of it - this is all crazy.
So much craziness in Sydney right now.
Holy shitttttt, it's my birthday tomorrow 🙈
Surprised my sister at the airport this afternoon - she didn't have a clue. 😊 http://t.co/d8s0Kf9SEm

Holy Shit 'Homeland' keeps getting more and more intense, I can't handle it 🙈
So Monkeys vet appointment went absolutely fine however it has now come to light that Monkey has been living a lie as he is in fact A GIRL!!
Monkey is going to his first ever vets appointment today &amp; I'm not even going to be there 😫. #crazyHamsterLady
Sent home from work early &amp; I'm actually gutted about it.
I'm 23 in a week 🙈 how the hell did that happen? #istillfeel12
Up early on a Sunday morning sat having a coffee near the Harbour Bridge. - feeling freshhhh. 👌
They've now given me the weekend off work, I'm actually quite gutted... 👎 - words I never thought I'd say!
Snuggled in bed listening to the stormy weather.. It's almost like I could back in Cornwall... ☔️☔️
Should have packed my pac a mac. OH BOO.
This storm better calm down by the time I have to walk home :( 💦🌂☔️
I'm not going to lie putting our Christmas tree up this afternoon when it was 29 degrees outside was a pretty weird feeling. #XmasinOz
Me and @Wilson92B  just bought our Christmas tree.. Eeeek. 🎅🎅🎄🎄 - feeling totally festive right now.
I am not at all sorry that I'm watching 'Love Actually' for the second time this week...
I've finished work, I'm home alone &amp; I'm not going out for at least 5 hours.. This means one thing for me.... NAP TIME 😴😴😴😴😴
I think Oz is a couple of episodes ahead of the Uk so I wouldn't wanna spoil it BUT... HOLY SHITT, Homeland just keeps getting better. 😮
Went to work today and I'm working tomorrow... Does this mean I'm not a bum anymore?! 🙉
I think Lewis Litt is my favourite ever tv character.
I'm in Australia so I don't I have itv2... So I did it, I treated myself and bought 'Love Actually' - CHRISTMAS IS COMING. Woo.
👌 http://t.co/8qFMBCYsEA
Might have some more work lined up. Wahoo. *dances around bedroom* 🙌
Literally just woke up from a 16 hour sleep - apparently I was tired!
I forgot how much I enjoyed listening Frank Turner.
I don't want to wish time away BUT I am super excited to see my big sister and little brother next month. 🙌
No wifi in the apartment for nearly a week, heldkjaonsj ARGHH - there's people I want to FaceTime :(
I can't even get the jobs I don't want... 🙈 why am I so unemployable?!
Went to a beach, didn't like it, moved onto the next one - my life is such a struggle today. #not
Just discovered the Australian channel that's showing the new series of 'Homeland' on. WOOO.
It's Monday, it's sunny &amp; I'm unemployed... Beach it is 🌞✌️🌞
I'm the other side of the world and I've had no internet all day...S CLUB 7 DID A REUNION?!???! 🙉
Doing the dishes, drinking red wine &amp; listening to Billy Joel...  A crazy Wednesday night in Sydney right there. ✌️
Watching 'Fatal attraction' for the first time ever... The term bunny boiler all makes sense now. That bitch crazzzzy.
It may only be for four hours but this afternoon I'm going back to work for the first time in nearly 2 months 🙈
Beach day 👌🌞
Can't sleep, my flats mates are being loud and playing shit music &amp; I'm craving a milk shake. None of this is okay. 👎😴
It might only be a job contracted for 1 and 1/2 days... BUT I FINALLY GOT OFFERED A JOB. Woo. 🙌🙌 $$$$$
I just drank 1 litre of milk in one sitting.. Feeling pretty sick right now 😷 I JUST LOVE MILK.
Which is a good thing cuz I now don't feel guilty about the fact I've spent the majority of the day in bed nursing a horrific hangover.
Sydney's throwing one hell of storm this afternoon.
THERE IS NOTHING SCARY ABOUT A BUNNY!!!! #justsaying
Another job interview tomorrow, it's third time lucky right???
I think I'm going through a major obsessed sushi phase. I CAN'T STOP EATING SUSHI 🐟🐟🐟
How have a not caught up on Homeland yet?!
I miss monkey.
Me and @Wilson92B just stood on our balcony and watched the traffic for nearly an hour... Can you tell we're unemployed?
Another job interview Thursday. Corr 🙈
Please may someone give me a job without the hassle of an interview?! Yeah... Ta 👍
Greys Anatomy Catch up. WOOO yeah. Oh how I've missed that face of yours Avery. 😍
I cannot complain about my life right now... http://t.co/YUOPRdRtx4
So excited for Sunday Funday 🙌🙌
I can't believe I've been living in Sydney for a month already... Time is flying.
I think 'Suits' might be my new favourite TV show.
The last job interview I did was over 4 years ago... Feeling pretty nervous about the one I have in an hour.. Wish me luck 🙏
Red wine and 'Pride and Prejudice' kinda evening...
Not gunna lie, I've become quite fond of sushi. Nommmm. 🐟
I've been up for hours, I'm still yet to achieve anything with my day. Eurgh.
Such a bollocks nights sleep. Boo. 😪😪😴😴
Tomorrow I am determined to be up before 9 am &amp; find a job!!! I CAN DO THIS. 👊
Sydney what you sayin' with this weather!!! Get me a boat.
I didn't think my Sunday evening would be spent in the police station giving statements. Thank god this weekends over.
So annoyed - I hate people.
Well transferring money overseas is a ball ache. Arghh.
Me and @Wilson92B are going to be soooo productive today. 🙌🙌
Sometimes I feel that I'm not really cut out for Hostel living. 🙈
Beach day. 👌🌞 #bondibeach #love
Moving hostels this morning - doing it without a hangover would probably of made the whole experience a lot more pleasant. #chunder
I think there's something ironic about the fact I really feel like getting drunk once this RSA course finishes...
I think drinking is a no no tonight - I think turning up to an RSA course hungover would be deemed inappropriate right?!
Probably one of the most hilarious slash awkward mornings of my life. 🙈 #wheninSydney
Free meal AND wine... Yeyy.
Next week I NEED to find a job. Ahh.
sta Cash card can go suck my hairy balls.
I'm a little bit in love with Sydney already.
It feels like mid morning yet I'm sat watching the sunset again, weird feeling.
Arrived safely in Hong Kong, smelling gross, looking grosser... Only 12 hours left then we've reached Sydney. WOOO.
Hoping this Long Island ice tea will take the edge off abit - feeling all jelly belly now. #nervous #excited ahh.
