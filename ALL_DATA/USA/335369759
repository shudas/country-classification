I respect D Rose because after three knee surgeries I doubt I'd even be walking. But what he said is just buffoonery
Brad Stevens deserves a few Coach of the Year votes...

Mountain Dew white out 😍😍😍😍😍
It being so sunny in the morning is just a little bit too happy for me.
Why there a 10:30 game on SUNDAY 😫😫😫😫 can't the late games be Saturday?
I'm confused at how the Blazers have less wins than the Spurs and Grizzlies but are seeded higher...
Goodbye Pacers.
Craving some cupcakes
New favorite word: bastard
Thunder not in the playoffs 😂😂😂
Pulling for you guys. No one wants the Nets in the playoffs. @bo_stevenson
Celtics on fire. No way they lose four in a row to the Cavaliers.
Nets beat the Magic so the Pacers MUST WIN to get in the playoffs.
You ever look at the time and wonder what you were doing at this time in the AM? Or is that just me? It is just me? Okay.
#Celticswin tonight and finish the season 40-42. Only two games under .500 AND a playoff bid after trading Rondo and JG. #Celticspride

Aaron Hernandez is found GUILTY of first degree murder. Life with no parole.

I don't know why y'all so shocked Miami ain't in the playoffs without LeBron???????? Common sense

There's a few scenarios in which the Celtics could get the 6th seed. Main one if Bucks drop last three and Celtics win last three.
Mannnnn I don't want the seniors to graduate
