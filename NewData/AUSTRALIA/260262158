Tired of "long-term climate projections" when they can't even get 7 days out right. Nothing but a bloody scamming fact.
Solo OUT. http://t.co/TiqK5jaIFd
YESSS WIN AGAIN!!! #COYG
FMS forecast revised, Solo being sheared to death while crossing just off NC now. http://t.co/0R3Ae7KZN1
Coquelin = Beast
Solo entering higher shear region, FMS goes for Cat. 2 near New Caledonia. http://t.co/xIori9WaS9
"Solo" (chuckles) still tracking near New Caledonia. Fiji M.S. now has storm at Cat. 1 during closest approach. http://t.co/RggKPM85Xp
TC 23P is apparently named as "Solo"...HAH!!
Fiji Met. Service track for 23P. Cat. 2 max storm. http://t.co/NMnghCLMd1
Cat. 2 or 3, it's time to be vigilant New Caledonia &amp; Vanuatu.
JTWC going Cat. 3 for TC 23P. New model run going for stronger max. http://t.co/IEufHac2Te
Cat. 1 or possibly 2 on AUS scale for 23P. Potential wind gust &amp; TS hazards, but heavy rain/flood is main threat to New Caledonia &amp; Vanuatu.
23P will continue to intensify on good vertical conditions, then weaken off while passing near/over New Caledonia area this weekend.
TC 23P forms over Coral Sea. Poorly drawn but GFS basically has it moving SE across New Caledonia &amp; Vanuatu areas. http://t.co/kpLXRcwNJP
