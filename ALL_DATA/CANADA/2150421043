It's a good night when your playing @masseffect #lovethisgame
Trying to choose a tea, it's not going so well... #tea @DAVIDsTEA http://t.co/BK5Tj2FE01
Can't wait for the end of the day; so I can finish #Fringe #season4
WTF!? How can Peter never have existed? They better fix this epic mistake #cryingforever #fandomfeels
You know your sleep deprived when you notice parallels between #TheHobbit and #onetinsoldier the ballad/song
Peter and Olivia are breaking my heart right now. I just kinda want to make them kiss and make up #Fringe #fandomfeels
Damn it #Fringe, I ship Olivia and Peter like whoa. They better have a Disney ending! :P
Found what amounts to a BDSM 'Pretty Woman' fanfic... Still a better story than #50shadesofgrey
When I get Complimented on having a very pretty cat... Thank you? She's a sweet heart lol http://t.co/TfAcizJ41e
Nope... I knew I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. SOMEONE always dies!! I'm so sick of these openings :(
Please, please, please don't have a sad beginning. The family is adorable and why can't everyone lives and no-one dies be a thing?#BigHero6
Why does Hero's big brother have to be so darn cute? Like seriously I feel like cooing over the cute.
Thank goodness for the pause button; I know I'm going to need pop, chocolate and a blanket for this beginning #BigHero6 what is my life?
I have such a bad feeling about #BigHero6 right now.... Someone always dies in the beginnings of these movies. Sad openings suck!
Drunk house mate needs to go downstairs and let me watch my movie fml
Hurting way too much... Pain pills need to kick in like now.
I love @NICKIMINAJ but #anaconda needs to get out of my head.
How about yes give up Finn; he's a murderer of innocents and a shit character #The100
Never mind Jaha is the king of all douche bags. So disappointed in his character #The100
Please tell me Jaha kills Kane? Because I still hate the dick #The100
Starting my marathon of #The100 season 2 now! Hell yeah it's going to be a good night :)
I'm refusing to fold any more clothes. I'm done, seriously. I have lost all ability to can...
I love how the rest of my space gets clean but my bed gets cluttered...
Sometimes being an adult is chore day, hungover and tired... #indulged #worthit #adult #life
Things I'm sick of hearing about: #50ShadesOfGrey its a piece of shit stop talking about it already
Waiting till the last moment to get ready for work...
I'd love a modernized version of #ScoobyDoo
Beer and pizza the supper of champions after tubbing lol
All suited up for tubbing; ready to go!
Can I go home now? I need to finish S2 of #BuffyTheVampireSlayer what is my life?
Got called into work... Well time to organize panties by colour.
Bored out of my mind...
You know you've watched too much #buffythevampireslayer when you want to use wiggins in a sentence.
The nostalgia of S1 #BuffyTheVampireSlayer
Fuck drama; I'm staying home and watching @Disney
#TheOtherWoman is seriously one of the greatest movies. Omg how did I not find this sooner?
That moment in time when you tell a creepy dude your waiting for Your girlfriends...
Heading over to landlords to play #pathfinder it's going to be a great night of #dungeonsanddragons
Found a story that's everything I want but it's written horribly but can't stop reading... #fanfiction #Nightmares
Wow... I suck at making grocery lists. My list consists of: food stuff, snack things, coffee, edible stuff and that's it... That's it.
Because you know women have no desire to be Terrifyingly Beautiful and deadly. Wait....
Things I've noticed, in documentaries if your large, dangerous and terrifying your male...
On the bus and I didn't bring a book... :(
Everyone on #The100 could go topless, especially #Lincoln #Clarke #Bellamy except #Finn. No one what's that asshole #topless
All I want is #Bellarke so nothing hurts; damn you #The100. 3 more episodes then I've watched them all in just over 24 hours.. #mylife
I just escaped the worst Christmas party I've ever experienced in my life...
Wishing I hadn't gone to my Christmas party... Feels so awkward.
Oh my fucking God... I can't believe who  plays Bell #Fringe #fangirling
Damn it Walter you had one job! #Fringe
Yeah I don't need my job reiterated three or more times in sure I can understand how to do it...
Fuck you Mitchell Loeb! #Fringe
What to watch? #Fringe or #PersonOfInterest or #ducktales? Hmmm
#Fringe why must you be so intriguing?
Cooking supper... It's a chilli kinda night.
What's with all the images? Is it something like #lost ? #Fringe
Started watching #Fringe this was a bad idea...
Trying to get warm and the will to make food... It's not working. I still can't feel my toes :( #cold #fuck #Winter
