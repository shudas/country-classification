Was absolutely shit arsed broke the last couple of months. I am finally building on my savings again. I'm exhausted but I'm recovering
In my two decades of existence, this is the first time I'm smiling after looking at my bank account. Two jobs are finally worth it
Tattoo in a week! I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED.

So many people who hate me + talk shit about me on social media. Will never sink to that level. Ammi taught me better 😊
Deleted a whole bunch of people off my Facebook beginning of this month and I feel good. No senseless negativity.
If I want to tweet about my sex life/lack of sex, bacon/whatever that disagrees with you... How is this a problem? It's my Twitter
Wow, Twitter has turned into a cesspool of petty popularity issues. Smh

Dear brands. If you're representing "real women" please represent skinny women as well as bigger ones. Women aren't all large/all skinny.

Morning coffee 😌🙌☕️
Elliott went out in the rain and got me yellow lilies, my favourite. When I asked him why he told me it's because I'm worth it. Oh, my. ❤️
Okay; so I never bothered to tweet about what a disaster this selfie rap thing is. Wtf Sri Lanka

Elliott put his FREEZING hands on my chest. I frown, he goes "What other purpose do you boobs serve right now? Nothing."  True.
Not going to apologise for eating meat. I mean have you HAD a medium rare porterhouse with chimichurri?!
It's 10 degrees C here! 😖❄️☔️
I take it back. Pizza is great. But this might be because I'm super stoned
The boy is such a hottie 😍
Those shoulders though. Standing at 6'4, over a foot taller than me 😳 http://t.co/Yb1zShORW5
He's taking me out to a fancy dinner. :') he didn't have to but he's doing it.

Honestly. A foetus with no conscious thought or action, a growing bunch of cells, is not a child already born. Ffs.
Do people honestly not see how detrimental it is to not legalise abortion?
Religion and anything to do with it bothers me. That being said, if you want to follow it, your choice. Just don't shove it at people
Olives are the devil. bye.

Why do we shy
From electric dreams 
That course in our blood
Like molten laser beams #songwriting
But baby tell me
why lust is such a taboo
When all it did was 
bring me right to you #songwriting

Camping up Mount Crawford this entire weekend with the boys! Yay!
And no off days last week. I'll probably die. But I'll be rich
Working all through easter. Not complaining because I'll be getting $55 per hour
The only "akki" in my life is my own sister. The only "aiyya" is her fiancé. Everyone else I'll extend that respect once it's earned
Funny how people slightly older than me expect me to respect them without giving me reason to. Go away.
I was having a nice day until they started playing One Erection in the bus 😑
