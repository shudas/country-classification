Why is BBC talking to Hague? Tories had their chance but refused to turn up. They now get a chance to talk unchallenged. Ridiculous.
Nicola an absolute star tonight. Leanne and Natalie very strong too. Ed a bit wishy washy. Farage an idiot. Cameron and Clegg too feart .
Nicola, we cannot afford more austerity. A big team of SNP MPs will make it possible to deliver real change. #BBCDebate
At least we can hear the arguments put forward by speakers on this debate. No Murphy.#BBCDebate
Nicola asks Ed if he would rather have Tory government than work with SNP. #BBCDebate
Ed, no coalition with SNP. You weren't offered one pal. Just vote by vote support. #BBCDebate
Nicola, I will never do a deal with the Tories. I will work with progressive parties and Ed if he shows he's better than Tories. #BBCDebate
Ed not ruling out deal with SNP. Talked round the question.  #BBCDebate
Does Ed forget that it was Labour who stuck us with huge PFI payments. NHS. #BBCDebate
I think #NicolaSturgeon is winning tonight's #GE2015 debate #SkyNewsPoll What do you think? http://t.co/2MPtIy7R3n
Nicola, we should treat immigrants the same way as we would want our emigrants to be treated. #BBCDebate
Leanne Wood, raising minimum wage would mean that wages could not be driven down.  #BBCDebate
Nicola, EU immigrants are net contributors to economy. #BBCDebate
Nicola, use the money saved by scrapping Trident to spend on children and services. Improve conventional forces. Quite right. #BBCDebate
Ed in a wee fantasy world. He said no to bombing and so WM said no so Obama said no. Dream on Ed, you ain't that important. #bbc debate
Nicola, better conventional defence is needed, not Trident. #BBCDebate
Natalie,  in an unstable world Trident doesn't make me feel safer. Fairness makes the world a safer place to live in. #BBCDebate
Leanne, immigrants increase tax pot. Could be part of the solution not the problem. #BBCDebate
Miliband to Farage, it is a disaster to leave EU.#BBCDebate
Nicola gives Farage a talking to. Quite right.#BBCDebate
Farage slags off audience, unbelievable.  #BBCDebate
Nicola, 100,000 new houses should be built and protect them for renting.
Garage blames migrants for housing shortage. Boos from audience.#BBCDebate
Nicola,  not a big enough difference between Ed and David C. We don't need to replace the Tories with Torylight but with something better.
Nicola, if Labour are not bold enough, we will make them bolder. Big clap from audience. #BBCDebate
First cheer of the night for Nicola. A disgrace that David Cameron is not here tonight. #BBCDebate
Not sure what Ed is saying, rather vague #BBCDebate
Farage, less money to go over Hadrian's wall. Twit. #BBCDebate
Natalie, most debt of youngsters is due to tuition fees.#BBCDebate
Natalie Bennett, we will challenge the establishment.#BBCDebate
Nicola, we will work for the many not the few. #BBCDebate
Leanne Woods, we will work for a new politics. #BBCElection  debate
As Leslie Riddoch questions, 'Why vote Labour in 2015 or 2016 if candidates are basically muzzled poodles' ? Same thing for the ConLibDems.
Ruth Davidson still does not understand basic economic theory. Mistaking book keeping for economics. Austerity kills the economy Ruth.
David Cameron on the telly telling us why we should vote Tory. Now why would we do a stupid thing like that? #VoteSNPgetScotland
Does Nick Clegg know that Wee Willie Rennie has sneaked out of bed and is on the telly talking rubbish. #VoteSNPgetScotland
Nick Clegg tries to sell the Lib Dems as less bad Tories. Talk about a lack of vision! #VoteSNPgetScotland
