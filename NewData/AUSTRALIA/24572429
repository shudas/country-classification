Cheesy bacon balls update - just discovered i put them in the freezer when I was drunk #makingcrispstastebetter
But I'd rather be a cretin and watch it on my ones right now
Also annoying, I've been told to wait and watch and enjoy game of thrones with everyone else tomorrow at a bbq which is fun yeah
Who has taken my cheesy bacon balls???? I have no dollar until tomorrow and tbh I was really looking forward to eating them. Day = ruined!!
Skydive postponed til Tuesday due to 'heavy winds' aka slight breeze and awesome weather
Had a freakin great birthday I drank so much rum and I'm jumping out of a plane tomorrow x http://t.co/XuOovfo3rW

Spider emerged as I came out of the shower. Ran into the street in a panic shouting for help, then realised I was practically naked
Run out of bog roll but too scared to touch the pack of new ones as I know there's a fuck off massive spider hiding in there.
