Feeling very homesick without my lover by my side...I realize that home is not a place but a feeling you have the person that you love.
Feeling so incredibly lost without my best friend. I am so blessed to have @timothytroy. I am so deeply in love with the most amazing man.
I love you @timothytroy, my rock, my best friend.
Just finished a 10 mile run in under 2 hours... I am happy with that :) @timothytroy would be so proud of me! #halfmarathontraining

You're a sky full of stars, I wanna die in your arms...I'm gonna give you my heart. http://t.co/2z6sjRXEd1
Such a busy night at work but having some homemade chili by @timothytroy is so wonderful at this hour :)
Listening to sports radio, attempting to fall asleep after a long night shift....sports radio is comforting because it reminds me of him.
I miss you already @timothytroy, I can't wait for our reunion and union. :)

With me there is no in between. It was practically on fire. #burnttoast http://t.co/hEHxYBeQ2N
