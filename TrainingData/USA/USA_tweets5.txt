Killed myself on the stair master, &amp; I'm in line @ @BurgerKing ?! Hell no. Drove right off. Don't need that here. #ByeFelicia
So was totally in the drive thru at @BurgerKing, ordered my food, &amp; then remembered I just did 30 minutes of cardio. (C)
So heartbreaking, and so unhealthy.
It's really heartbreaking to see someone so unhappy that they eat to mask their feelings.
What exactly is a crepe?! #replytweet

I'm more scared of a 10lb chihuahua than I am of my or any 70lb pitbull.
You'll never hear about a vicious lab or chihuahua but a pitbull looks at you funny or show their teeth and everyone freaks out.
It's astonishing to me that people still believe what they hear / see in the media.
It's so frustrating when people are rude about pitbulls. I feel like my child is being bullied.
Eating healthy isn't always "fun", trust me. But it's always worth it
I couldn't imagine eating the way I used to. Starbucks, anything in sight, more coffee. Just junk all the time. So gross.

Bogut with an Adonal classic right there
If you asked me which team would deny Bogut the ball in that area the best.. I probably wouldn't guess Portland
Portland has done a good job not letting GSW get the ball to the middle of floor on half court sets
Mo looks like he hit up Temple last night. Or maybe it's that he didn't hit up Temple last night
