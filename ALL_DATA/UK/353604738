Will be going out clubbing in reading tonight. Direct message me if you want to say hello to me or drink with me at pres.
Would pay anything to be back on my way to pacha right now😢😢😢
This time last week 😱😱😢😢
Oh wait..
So earlier I caught up with a couple of the @C4MensFootball spice boys to ask about there time in salou here's what they had to say...
"@SkyNews - CCCU 1st year student Sam Rogers to replace Zain Malik in One Direction as Simon Cowell attempts to save the band."
"Say something I'm giving up on you" Don't give up on me please
Helen Rogers is less than impressed at the state of my house/room. "How can you live like this Sam?" Has been said multiple times.
ROG IS HEADING HOME! DM ME IF U HAVE MISSED ME AND WANT TO MEET UP !!!!
Struggling to think how I will sell chicken pittas in 2 hours
One of the better nights out in canters👌👌🙀🙀
A. Haloumi
Q.What did the cheese say when he looked in the mirror?
Lastly id like to leave you guys with a joke.
Lastly I'd like to thank everyone who has stuck with and supported me through these past years I can't thank you enough.
I will be taking over @NandosUK Twitter account at 9pm tonight to do a Q and A about my career and to give any advice to future nandocans..
And I'm here tonight to confirm that these rumours are true.
I know there has been rumours going around that a man of my up selling capability could sell chicken to a vegetarian..
But it's those mistakes that have made me the Nandocan that I am today.
Guys don't get me wrong I have burnt haloumi, I have misheard customers and sent through fries instead of rice but haven't we all?
Fortunately I am the latter
Some people have to work hard but to others it just comes naturally.
People often ask me "Sam how did you become such a Nandocan genie?"
I've had lows
I've had highs
3 years ago today I begun my career as a young vulnerable and timid Nandocan.
FUCKING COME ON READING YOU BUNCH OF BEAUTIES I FUCKING LOVE YOU URZZZZZZZ
