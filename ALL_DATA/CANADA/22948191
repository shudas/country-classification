A HUGE congrats to @shadkmusic on becoming the new host of Q. Good Job young man
What's your fav Snoop song?
Kokane in the hook with Snoop over any one of those guys' beat was the epitome of West Coast Music to me
Westcoast production was always the forefront. Fredwreck, Jelly Roll, Dre, Battlecat, Nottz, Hi Tek...and so much more.
Snoop Dogg has some great albums. Me and @the_jamshed used to rinse The Last Meal that one summer.
