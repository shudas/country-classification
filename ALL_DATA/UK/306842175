I am so disgusted with the people this world are producing
...and the utter stupidity of @E_L_James writing so-called "novels" promoting the apparently "romantic" connotation of sexual abuse
I cannot express in words the shock I felt during the last 20 minutes of the film at the positively primeval outlook on human intimacy...
...And the second half was spent romanticising sexual and emotional abuse.
I wanted to see what the fuss was about, and found that the first half was just poorly executed in every possible way...
I honestly don't think I have ever been more disgusted by a movie than I just was while watching 50 Shades. I feel sick to my stomach.
Runescape's so hard to play on a tablet
