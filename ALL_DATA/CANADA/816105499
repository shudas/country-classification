Since when did being an adult require life changes? #stressed #justwannastay
Someone get me a birthday gift where I can use coupons to get out of work and go see my boyfriend and others#thatshouldexist @Postnikoff420
Ok, this is why we don't invite random people into our houses. #anotherstalkeranotherday
This new found love and appreciation for my relationship is driving me insane and requires the weekdays to pass quickly. #stressedaf
I miss sleeping next to you. #onenightisnotenough
The only more impossible thing than staying, was leaving.
I believe you can love anyone, you just have to love the right person.
Lazy Sundays watching Teen Mom  #itsmyrutual
I think we re getting back to where we used to be happier, something good. #justus
LIFE is not a romance people let's just get that clear. Relationships are complicated like math.
This sucks. 😣
Ugh, this night is horrible. This decision is killing me. #remindmeagain
Shock can do strange things to the body.
Just breathe.
You. Never. Text. Me. Back.
Ok, I thought George dying in greys anatomy was sad, but Doby dying in Harry Potter is worse. #weekendmoviemarathon
1 month until I can have legal hangovers!
Debating whether sleep or the walking dead is more important. #sleep #meh
We re all trying to make it to the weekend. #mondayssuck
New car tomorrow 👌🚕🚕🚕
Stupid boys.
Watching the movie valentines day probably isn't the best idea to cure pain I'm suffering from my dead fish. #HeWasntEvenNamed
When your valentines day backfires and your fish dies 🐟🐠🐟🐠 #LiterallyCried
Since it's not a good time to talk right now, I've decided it's possibly not a good time to date right now. #CuttingItClose #YeahThatHurt
Well, you are really helping me through all of this. #NotAGoodTime #Wow #ThanksIGuess
Who else is not looking forward to the next five days? 🙋
Okay, don't hate you as much.
Tissues bedside. Red eyes. All night. #notyourfault #youdidntknow
Laying in bed all day does no one justice. #justreallyhatelife
Today is not a good day. Declared not.
You didn't apologize. I did. And I'm always gonna be apologizing. And the sad thing is, I'm ok with it. #toomuch
SHHHIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTT!!!!!!
I'm not afraid to hurt you because I now know you can take it now. And now we can share this invisible pain together.
You're cut off.
Seriously, you're fucking annoying right now. #no
I think Im gonna buy a red beta for V-Day. Yupp, I could name him Lovely. #ThatdBeLovely #OrAnotherStreetDrug
Meet me halfway and let's catch a movie.
I have a perfectly imperfect relationship. And I love it.
Just applied for university. #meh ✌️
You're not better than me. I'm not better than you. We re this thing called equal. #sidenote
Your texts make my mornings better. ☺️
Yupp, definite girl crush in the making.
Just stop trying.
Let's have fun experiences together.
Why do we do horrible things? #DissapointedInMyself #LeavingCrators
Life sucks. When did life begin to suck? I mean, one day it was just like "I'm gonna suck today". Ya, life sucks.
I am totally undeserving yet you still love me. #WorkingOutTheKinks #2015
Wow do you even realize how much of a hypocrite you are.
Passed a minivan with a Christmas tree strapped to top of it. #iguessitsnevertoolate
To weekend? Or not not to weekend?
Spending Christmas with you, ahh the thought. #yay
That feeling when you spend what seems like hours on end doing what you love, then sending it out into the world and people recognize.
You're right, I do live under they're thumb 😒😒😒
You said you'd text me when you had good news #youtexted
Everything's just a big elephant ass mess!!!! I need something to be a yes.  #why #nomoremaybes
Haven't taken any photos for the month of November! #stuck #hitmeup
I'm sorry but, just because you never see anyone does not give you the right to not use tweezers. ✋🙅 #girlcode
"How about this, I'll come see you tomorrow night. That I can promise". We can't keep all of our promises but we can the important ones.
Ladies and gentlemen, he's back.
I just want my boyfriend right now 😡
Ridiculously anxious. #nosocialinteractionfordays
Shit got real.
Sometimes photographs just make you cry.
All I wanna do is kiss my boyfriend but I'm stuck here eating peanut butter and bananas and watching Netflix. #whatisthis
Sending love and good vibes down south 📫❤️😘 #fingerscrossed #chill #eek
White car + snow = not a good combo #withfries
I don't like having bad dreams due to news that makes me anxious and nervous. #goodnewsequalsgooddreams
So excited!!!! Just finished my first official photography job. #sentandmailed
Need bae and decent air conditioning. #meh
Come home. I miss you.
Stoked for my shoot tomorrow.
I love my boyfriend. That is all, keep scrolling. #boyfriendappreciationtweet
You know what's awesome when your boyfriend leaves? Not a fucking thing. #Meh
UUUUUUUIGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!! FFFFUUUUUUUUUUCCCKK!!!!!
The weekend after the long weekend &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Times get tough, but I'm a strong girl #love
Just one phone call. #please
Love yourself! And fuck all the sons of bitches that should text you everyday because it's supposed to be a two part relationship. #yupp
Things just aren't the same #notsooneyear
Ugh, nights without bae 👎
Driving into the dark downhill abyss. Literally.
Drumheller bound! ✌️🌄
Less than 24 hours! #soexcited #roady
Leading the paranoid crazy people to wherever the hell they're going.
Ugh, this week is such a tease. #hurryup
OMG, you're so annoying. #rethink #yourlife
Hangover, you're a bitch
Whenever I get anxious or paranoid, I just think about puppies. Then I have another new problem. I want a puppy #buymeapuppy #theybecute
Girls are confusing as hell.
This week is gonna suck.
Don't wanna waste my time doing nothing when it could be wasted with you.
When Blair and Chuck get engaged on gossip girl. #ah #yes
You look hungover. #ewie
I had an amazing weekend with  @Postnikoff420  #bucketsoffun #morelikepails #loveumore #beersbee #beerdarts http://t.co/bONY64mkQO
Life can suck.
Frustrated and upset.
Waking up in kitty afterbirth. #Yupp #ThatsAFirst
Well that was a complete surprise. #turnfortheworst
I just really miss you.
New roommate. #mommadrama
Gone.
Everyone's looking forward to the weekend, while I wish it'd never come. #dontgo
Booked Portabellas reservations with the bae 💁👭 #forreal #LEZbehonest
Another amazing weekend with @Postnikoff420 All I wanna do is cuddle and watch Diff'rent Strokes. Babe you the best❤️ http://t.co/nOkLh2tKfe
Not even he deserves this. #losingallsanity
Ok, someone just buy me some lighting lamps already.
Day 3: sucks #missingyou #comehome
Goodbyes. Yupp, definitely don't handle them well.
Am I being selfish?
Seriously you're fucking scum. #Lowandlower #low
Food is the way to my heart, next to boys in ball pants. But yupp, food is definitely up there. #WhatCanISay #ILoveCrisp
I'm not putting you on a pedestal but even when you do the right thing you can still disappoint me.
Watching American Pickers with dad on a Saturday morning.
And I love you.
Looking forward to the weekend with him.
"That'd be good if they had someone like Amelia Earhart in it. You know, if they ever found her. But ya know ya can't win then all."
Ugh! Craven fever!!! @FrankieJoe_8
You don't even have photoshop and you're expertise pertaining to fitness is a percentage of 0.
Just disappointment.
Seriously! You really suck at this whole photography thing. #JustStop
So tired. #Itsonlythefirstday #ohshit
When you read it things will be better, hopefully.
Let a summer full of #UnderTheDome begin!
This moving thing sucks @Postnikoff420  #missingyou 😥
Why do I feel like I'm moving a million miles away when I'm only an hour away? #We'reStillTurtlesRight #MissYou #SadTweet
You don't pass, you win.
Fuck exams!
I feel this is gonna be be the beginning of a lot of lonely nights.
Last colour day, last day of school, last chance to leave a little piece off me behind. #ForeverAViqueen #LastDay
When I need you the most, you're thinking about the short term instead of the long term. #ThanksALot
"You're gonna make this math test your bitch." -Words of encouragement from @Postnikoff420 #MakeItBleed 👊
You've been there to wipe my tears now let me wipe yours.
This rain has to stop. #ruinmyplans
Wishing I could wake up with you to the sound of the rain like we did before. #GonnaMissYou
People tell people things everyday, but it only takes one thing to change a racing heart into one that will be loved forever #MyOneThing
Life is way too short to not take the chances and be with the people that make us the happiest in life. So stop waiting and begin your life.
An afternoon filled with Orange is the new black 🙌 #praisethelord #dandelion
Weekend plans, don't fail me now⚾️#4thtime
"Don't do it if it's easy." - Wyatt Postnikoff, apparently words to live by @Postnikoff420
I’ll carry the weight
I’ll do anything for you
My bones may break
but I’ll never be untrue
You have absolutely no reason to forgive me.
You see, there's people who drink and don't drink. All I'm saying is I like booze. #DAF
I had so much fun cruising through the country side with my bestie and the boys. @FrankieJoe_8 #twitterlessboys #mud #country
Don't let this ship go sinking down with only me paddling.
Boys, take me mudding. #ThatIsAllIAsk
This isn't my life.
Please don't call me Susan. #mynameisdandelion #limo
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop smiling.☀️
What happens on formal day, stays on formal day.
One pissed off blonde right now.
A few hours was simply not enough to cure this case of heartache. #ThisSucks
Silence.
Can I say I expected more? Or would that be an overstatement. #greatstart #longweekend
It's that time of year again. When chapsticks melt to shit in a hot car cup holder.💄 #noonelikeswarmlipbalm
#when you have to febreze your boyfriends room. #hellno
Come out won't you turn my soul into a raging fire.
Growing up ain't so bad when you got @FrankieJoe_8 as your roommate to be! #dateset #moving #blondeandbrunette
This love is unreal.
This weekend has been completely amazing. So happy to have spent it with @FrankieJoe_8 @Postnikoff420 @CJCrawford19 love you guys! #grad2014
I said things I should not have said last night. #blackoutdrunk
