Why do people insist on using the self service tills in tesco to do a trolly full of stuff?! It will always end badly! And it's annoying!!
Love how @BRIT_Awards Tweets are 10seconds quicker than the action tv!
Driving round Hinckley with a mirror ball on my back seat listening to tyre tracks and broken hearts from whistle down the wind! So sad!
Birthday drinks start now! Good gig now back at Maina manor for lots of drinkies!! @80smaniashow
loving a bit of old Lee Evens on Comedy Central!
got bored, watched the Vicar of Dibley, joined Twitter and now drinking lemsip. I have such a cool life!
