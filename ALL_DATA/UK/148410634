The vines that are like "these nuts" have got me in bits
No even joking about 13 people have added me on Facebook the day. What's going on
Aw fuck this. Needing to just get my hair dark again n leave it like that 💤
Nobody ever bleach their hair. Pish
Michaelas insisting I get an inch off my hair cause the ends are so bad from bleach. I can tell this is gonny end in a hissy fit

Put the lottery on last night and I've lost the ticket. Bet that's the winning numbers 😂
Last night was one of the best nights out I've had in a while like
Guys take gayer group photos than girls do
Kellies on her way to mine and it genuinely looks like a bombs went off in my room.
Wish I was going to rhumba
Ufc makes me feel seek. Can't handle the violence 😢
Just out the lottery on aswell, obviously feeling lucky the day
Now the question is.. Do I go out tonight or not
There's nothing better than checking the bank and having more money than you thought you did 😝😝
If I got a good win I'd be buying a horse n making it run next year
Got 2nd, I'll take that
2 of my horses down already. Cunts
I want to go to the grand national next year. I get such a buzz from it
If saint are wins the shots are on me the night
If I don't at least win back the £30 I put on the horses I'll no be happy
I'm always the one to help folk when they need it and every single time it gets chucked right back in ma puss. Never again like
