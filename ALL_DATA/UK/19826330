. Fuck @UKIP . Deport @Nigel_Farage . Who the fuck cares where!
I'd like fucktard @Nigel_Farage dead. I'll make it so.

Hello @NickBolesMP , why would you vote for #Sleaford MP #StephenPhillips ? @Conservatives
Has @piersmorgan again claimed that @George_Osborne - who once failed to find his front door - is Britain's most astute politician? #bbcqt

Atlantis - The Evidence was the most fascinating, compelling programme I've seen in quite some time. Thank you @bettanyhughes .

I'm not registered to vote. Can anyone give me a reason to? My constituency is #SleafordandNorthHykeham . I've never been to either.
So unfair. Cats are so low maintenance. We've three, down from six.
I love iced tea, but I can recommend you give Lipton raspberry ice tea a wide berth.
This is a man with a double first in Physics &amp; Chemistry, and a PhD in something something mass spectronomy something autoclaves (I think).
Dad came in late, so I told him what and where the casserole was. Instead of couscous, he's got himself a couple of spoonfuls of houmous!
I wouldn't want the Dopeys anywhere near my dissertation!
I'm not keen on Twitter's latest iteration on my Android.
I'm also as shallow as a saucer.
I'm a size 10. Was 16!
Opened the trap and released...cheese into the wild.  Yesterday's mouse ain't having none of it!
I think @bbcnickrobinson Nick Robinson sounds better like this. Less strident and triumphalist. Quite reasonable, in fact. @BBCNews
Can't we have #GE2015 rubbish at the end, and the proper news first, please? @BBCNews @itvnews
