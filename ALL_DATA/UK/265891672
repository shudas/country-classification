Number of times I had to give my Macbook a blow tonight to get the sound back: 10.

Got the new Google Handwriting Input. It's damn cool haha. It actually works regardless how horrible your handwriting can get.
Sometimes, just sometimes, I think I belong in the kitchen. http://t.co/ucdMkQ5F1Q
That feeling when a character you properly liked is killed.

Adele set fire to the rain. I set fire to my hand. I must be #Targaryen because it didn't hurt at all.

It's bad publicity day for @megabusuk lol
Found a lost book in the ASS. Wow.
Wtf CNA? The translators for the speakers giving non-English speeches are terrible and making the latter sound really bad.
Great dinner, lovely piano accompaniment. Perfect midweek evening only at @PizzaExpress
What CNA?! I want to see the vigil ceremony and the lying in state, not random shots of the Parliament building ._.
"@ParkStreetEvent: We say eggs, @Bristol_Bond says Hot Cross Buns but what is your favourite thing about #Easter? #PSEggHunt" Eastervacation
I just started thinking. I live alone in my room and no one checks on me.

What happens if I actually died?
You clearly need a deodorant if I step into the kitchen and I can smell your body odour.

Badly.
Thank God for high metabolism rates. I can eat junk like this at midnight and still look scrawny. #vscocam http://t.co/K6XcMhoua6

The current record for having a hiccup was 68 years.

Mine has been going on for half a day now. #gettingthere
The meaning of commitment seems to be misplaced nowadays.

People readily give their word to a cause but do not bother seeing it to the end.
Perks of staying in hall:

I can wake up from a nap 10 minutes to lecture starts and still make it in time.
Dream but don't dream too far and lose sight of who you are.
When you hit rock bottom, the only way to go on is up.
Everyone ought to stay away from their family for an extended period of time. Harshest lesson on independence, but the most effective.
It's Ash Wednesday today.

It's MY day today.

Sudden urge to go travelling. What's Amsterdam like?
I tend to overestimate my stomach's capacity. 
I just downed a steak bigger than my hand, chips and onion rings. So full I can't move.
'Tom &amp;  I, we've done so much for the JCR' *inserts raised eyebrows* so tell me exactly, what is your definition of 'so much'
Not entirely sure if keeping them in my room was a good move. The temptation is so strong. #vscocam http://t.co/5uIRw2hVT1
That #awkward moment when the customer officer from @Singtel replied your query with an email teeming with grammatical errors.
Love is like oxygen- love is a may splendor thing- love lifts us up where we belong! All you need is… http://t.co/9EurZyu61Z
I'm actually glad I'm the only one watching #MoulinRouge in the bar. At least I can shamelessly sing along to every song.
Watched Katy Perry's performance on the Superbowl. I had to watch Beyonce's performance just to neutralise the after effects.
Laksa is heaven on Earth.
So hungry my hair turned pink.
It worked. Haha.
Coursework due in 17 hours time and I'm still watching the #LordOfTheRings trilogy. #priorities

Sometimes, I actually have to look up Google and Urban Dictionary to understand what the kids are talking about.

Wilko's bread knife is so sharp that it tore a hole in my plastic bag while still in its case. Some dude just got himself a free knife.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. One painful play of emotions.
No, seriously, feck off woman. I've left the committee and cannot be bothered to have another round of verbal agument with you any further.
Apparently the Lord Mayor is travelling the road of #BristolCity with Santa Claus.

Seriously Mdm VP, stop all your bullshitting &amp; get the facts right. You're just pissing me off.
Awkward when you're locking up and you've got to chase a couple out from proceeding any further.

It's easier to believe in this sweet madness, this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees. #angel #flyawayfromhere
I just had a large kebab and 1/4 of a whole cheesecake, in one sitting.
This is definitely not the time to be starting on a new K drama. #priorities
You know there is something wrong with the weather here when the only piece of clothing I have is my cap and I'm perfectly comfortable.
Now I remember why I skipped Fresher's Fair last year; the queue.
Thank God. The sun's actually out.
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside the letterbox, they tumble blindly as they make their way #acrosstheuniverse
And when the broken-hearted people in this world agree, there will be an answer; let it be. #letitbe #Beatles
Carry me home tonight.
Everytime you ask me what I wanna do, I ask you what you wanna do because I wanna do whatever you wanna do.
Zombie. It was the first song I played while you sang.
When you just keep staring at 'Online' in a whatsapp conversation and not knowing what to do.
I suddenly feel overwhelming sadness.
Love, emotions, it's all hormonal tricks.
At least you wouldn't be locked out of the house, waiting for someone to wake up and rescue you.
Keys. They're important. Bring them whenever you cycle out, crap.
Final hours in uniform.
Eat. Sleep. Rave. Repeat.
My heart couldn't beat any faster. Thanks eh.

Shopping spree. 1 vest, 2 shirts and a suit. And I'm still not done yet. #spendmoneylikewater #butpayisnotinyet
So I just signed up 15 sessions of Body Massage, Body Scrub and Steam Bath. WHAT UP?!
Waiting for my Body Treatment at ATOS Wellness. Lol. #awkwardmoment

That awkward moment when the guy opposite you in the train has the same exact sandals. #baikper
You're like a laser light burning down on me.
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia, is it cool if I get lost in them? #castle #macklemore
One thing I will not miss come Bristol: my sweat-drenched shirt. #sosingaporean
I just had 5 M&amp;S chocolate belgian waffle sandwich. Best start to my last official workday.
Get along with the voices inside of my head.
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim. I wanted to be cool, I wanted to fit in. #macklemore #wings #sosleepy
I got my reset button and I blew it.
Apparently the drop at the train station yesterday left two ugly scratches on opposite corners of my phone T.T
Using your head to push open a stuck door is a bad idea. In fact, it's a terrible idea. #stupidityatitsfinest
Just promise me you'll think of me, everytime you look up into the sky and see a star.
The rain has just disrupted my evening plans: to soak in the training pool in the warmth of the setting sun. #knn
Post lunch sleepiness. I should just sleep. It says so on the poster outside the office.
Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough, ain't no river no wide enough.
I only think in the form of crunching numbers; in hotel rooms collecting page six lovers.

Best evening of this week. Thank you for everything.
I'm gonna wake you up in the morning, with some tea and toast. #lucyspraggan #teaandtoast
I have so much free time I am constantly going to the toilet to empty my bowels.
#donttakedefenceforgranted
The multiple sirens announcing CAT 1 might be insignificant, but to me it's an example of how it'll be like if we were caught in conflict.
I'm gonna fly like a bullet through the night, feel my tears as it run dry. #chandelier #sia
So much free time till 5.#firstworldproblems
Two days and counting.
My opinion might be flawed, but sending you away is probably the best thing.
All I want is a reset button.
This is awkward.
Ice cream before dinner is the best decision made.
Strawberry fields. Nothing is real. And nothing to get hung about. #strawberryfieldsforever #beatles
Exactly 28 days left before I'm shipped of to UK.
It's not even six but I'm already awake for work. T.T I might end up walking the 16km later.
It's been close to two hours since I left the pool and I still smell like chlorine water. Blearghs.
Spent 2 &amp; 1/2 hrs trying out every possible combination of 4 digits, starting from 0001 because I forgot my code. #truestory
Here goes nothing. @MunahAndHirzi http://t.co/2XnX2nRxKq
It takes more than an hour on train to go home. If not for my uniform, I would gladly sit down and nap. #firstworldproblems
"@DepressedDarth: If you love someone set them free, or cuddle and watch Star Wars with them." then proceed to seduce them with the Sith.
People are talking about gay sex in the office. #awkward
Yes, I'm sitting down in the train whilst in my uniform. Let's see who is going to take a picture of it.
First day of work and I have nothing to do till 5. #firstworldproblems
The world spins with every step.
I'm sure I'm still on British time. It's 20 to 5 am and I'm wide awake. #jetlag #ftw
There is no hot water! #firstworldproblems
So someone random just called out my name. #awkward
Ashraf: 1. Eggshell: 0.
Final update on Mission Eggshell: enemy spotted in massive chunk of egg white. Eggshell safely retrieved and disposed. End of mission.
Update on Mission Eggshell: eggshell has taken cover with coagulated egg white. Must approach every egg white piece with extreme caution.
Update on Mission Eggshell: point blank scrutiny is futile. You only end up with hot spicy soup in your eye and temporal blindness.
What's worse than dropping an eggshell in your breakfast? Losing it after. Every mouthful is filled with fear and trepidation. #fearfactor
After an arduous 7 hours, I've finally conquered income concepts; stuff which would be useless after Friday. #brainfail

Someone tell me, how do you study for a language that you've just learnt for only 10 weeks?
Best way to practice Italian: whatsapp your mum in Italian.

Buongiorno. Mi chiamo Ashraf. Sono di Singapore.
