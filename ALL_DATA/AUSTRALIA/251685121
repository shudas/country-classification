Booked the first couple of nights stay in Auckland. This is real life. ☀️✈️🌅

Didn't expect to be taking a dip in the river on my morning run this morning - such a sucker for a spaniel 🐶👙

Just got home after a very long and hard hangover day, but also after the best weekend in Cardiff ever #girlsassembled #unay
Life, always giving me lemons. Thank god I will be in Cardiff this evening to get the tequila for the lemons 😜
Black Friday scares me. It's just leading to excessive impulse buying for myself. #merrychristmasme
Tomorrow I will see both @Chloe_Evans10 and Cardiff #happydays
Happy birthday to my lovely cousin @chgmoore 😘
16 days until Cardiff time @Chloe_Evans10 @Carys_Hughes @josiesteer I'm getting fluxed for the first time this year. Psyched.
Days like this make me wish I could crawl into bed with @josiesteer and @Carys_Hughes #life #lemons
Kurt Geiger sale 👌
First taste of the year of the Starbucks Eggnogg latte, feeling festive #redcups #christmascountdown http://t.co/qQy2GwacXd

Reading wuthering heights in the bath before sitting by the fire with my dogs... What has my life become.
Halloween just signifies that Christmas is getting closer

Bublè bath ☑️ Warm milk ☑️ The Grinch ☑️
Pizza, onesie, films and rain 👌
The worlds neediest hangover
Happy birthday to a very special lady miss @AmeliaRansome ! Have the best day xxxxx http://t.co/0GmftJCgsQ
Looks like people had a really great night at the union last night...But that's totally fine because I watched the hobbit and had a bath.. 😒
Thought I'd be more jealous of all the uni night out photos, but then I remember the feeling of a hangover and the jealousy goes away👌
That awkward moment when you get caught wearing your mums engagement ring on your engagement finger alone in your room... #ifonly #asif
So happy with my number one super babe @CharBillings #mygirl #funfair #southbank http://t.co/hGQB7tfMAL
It's days like this when I remember how much I ❤️ living in London.
Thank God that @LouiseHGodwin gets back today. I've missed my little ragamuffin 👯👭
Post-uni blues hitting me hard on this hangover. Where are my lions too? #imisscardiff
My dad just asked the waiter at lunch "how much for the little girl?" Why does he always try and sell me when we are on nice family lunches?
Today I see the big dogs @josiesteer @JoeStollery23 @JPFroom I can't wait!!!
http://t.co/1FFJtOXUMT   CRY
If people would kindly refrain from putting any pictures of Cardiff on Facebook/Instagram until I leave in Feb it would be much appreciated
A weekend full of events with my minion @AmeliaRansome #theone #myangel
The stress that comes with having the X factor and MIC on in one evening and I haven't got time to watch either #firstworldproblems
Best bank holiday weekend. Cirque, notting hill carnival &amp; @Chloe_Evans10 tomorrow 👌💁
"I'm going to crimp my hair the day we leave for travelling so that it stays that way for the whole time"- @Carys_Hughes for 5 months?

Made in Chelsea is making me want to move to NY so much. I missssss it. @Georgia_Cannell pack your bags http://t.co/c67wl4FNta
It is nice that all the roads in Wimbledon are closed for the cycling, meaning I have to walk everywhere in the rain and thunder...
Just booked my train tickets to Abergavenny. Miss @Carys_Hughes &amp; Llandovery, I am coming for you very soon. #backofbeyond #imaseeasheep
Finally taken my princess themed hair braid out after 4 months. Looks like graduating is helping me grow up a little. Bye bye braid.
Nothing I love more than a sunny afternoon and a cuddle with Dulcie http://t.co/egkuF9vBMN
After 2 nights of being apart @josiesteer is coming back to stay, splendid. #watchoutwimbledon
Needy hangover day 3

I'm in bed with Darcy and Ruby, sort of feels like I'm snuggled up with @Carys_Hughes and @josiesteer #bliss
Anyone else forget to order the graduation gown and now find that it's too late? No... Didn't think so #muppet

#socialfirst
Forgot how antisocial I become during Wimbledon fortnight.
Despite being a graduate I'm in very high spirits
A solid 24 hours between leaving Cardiff and being reunited with @staceypont and @JoannaAmyHay #startasyoumeantogoon
Feels a bit bizarre coming into my room and not finding @Carys_Hughes in my bed.
Well that's that then. Thanks Cardiff, and my lions, you've been the best. So sad to go: "gone but never forgotten" http://t.co/8fdIrRGKpw
Last night at Cardiff university over. I'm in denial that I have 7 hours left until I leave forever.
Last night in Cardiff, no one mention that to me once I've had an alcoholic drink. #ilovecardiff #ilovethelions
As I pack up my room for the last time, I begin to realise that my life is pretty much over now. It is all downhill from here.
#bigmac
Big happy bday to my beautiful people @goodenough11 and @AmyParsons1 #imfeeling22
Christ 33 is hormonal #endoftermblues
Time for my 4.30 nap &amp; realise @Carys_Hughes won't be joining &amp; now I realise that i'm leaving Cardiff on friday, who will nap with me then?
2 people in need of crutches, one absent generally and the rest still struggling quite majorly. What a great party.
#bigsummerblowout #thelastlash
After admitting all confessions from the year at 33 Coburn, we are all still the best of friends. #filth #naughty #badbehaviour #2weeks
The vibe in 33 today is absolutely fantastic
Can't wait for @Chloe_Evans10 and @katieameliafox to finish exams tomorrow so the real party can begin. #champagne #33 #lionsdengohard
Got some highly exciting news this morning that @Hannahbuxton is coming to Cardiff. #welovethebux #coburnshipoflove
How is this day not over yet?!? #hungover #needyforasnuggle
Witnessed Josie's first drink since April 19th. She's gonna get steeeeeeamin tonight. Good luck @josiesteer
Anyone want a sleepover with @Carys_Hughes and myself tonight after a BNO at retros?
Top night in Llandovery last night. Country people hit it harrrrrrd.
Corrrr my hangovers these days really show how old I'm getting
Congrats to @Carys_Hughes who has just finished her last exam. Time to celebrate how great the past 3 years have been! #ilovecardiff
Whistle stop tour of London and now back to Cardiff to celebrate the end of @Carys_Hughes exams tomorrow and @kesler101 for Monday! #unaaay
Chelsea Flower Show with the main man himself @markjdcannell http://t.co/waat619GvN
Home to my very well behaved pooch #darcy4life http://t.co/wx2fdYgIrD
Well rumours of dissertation marks coming back today has royally killed my mood.
Back to London for the Chelsea Flower Show
Got an exam today but all I can think about is how once it's finished then so is my uni life. Cry.
Not sure which one you look happier in @Carys_Hughes #unilyf #bignight http://t.co/ZpglMKMFrs
Congratulations to my parents @markjdcannell and @SusannahCannell on their 26th wedding anniversary! I can't even keep a plant alive. ILYSM.
Really want to buy a bunny but, how will I pay to keep it? Considering in 3 days time I'm going to be your regular, unemployed, non-student.
So bloody relaxed after Made in Chelsea, a glass of red and a half an hour massage from miss @Chloe_Evans10 #dream #examseason
Genuinely what am I going to do with my life next year.
5 years ago?! How?? @Hannahbuxton @ctsiv @Ella_Knight1 @therealmvt #timeflies #missya http://t.co/xoLd1SJRFl
The lions den in tears after the final act in BGT tonight.
Tonight took me right back to my wild youthful days
Been back in Cardiff for 1 day and have already had to add a bottle of wine to my ocado delivery. The library is negatively affecting me.
If I was a rat.. I think I would be this one? http://t.co/RXcsibOgyg
Just touched down in London city
Can't believe this is our last day in NYC. All that awaits at home is revision and a distinct lack of wine #bestholidayever #funinthesun
Can't believe I spent my first night in New York mobbing Justin Bieber.
Got taken by mob mentality in NYC this evening... Waited for an hour and a half to see Justin Bieber, don't even like the geeze. #wheninnyc
About to go to New York with @Georgia_Cannell- posting a photo for all of you revising! See you in a week. http://t.co/vxDag9dk6P
Extremely excited that I actually now have a passport and can say I'm definitely off to NYC with @Georgia_Cannell the day after tomorrow
I don't want to sound like a London loser but the new tube design is really fantastic. Highly enjoying my journey! #homesweethome
London today in prep for holidays #whatexam #whatcoursework
Hotel booked for New York, 5 days until we leave and McBusted tomorrow evening! @Georgia_Cannell #psyched #bestfrunds
Best birthday everrrrr@Carys_Hughes big night
