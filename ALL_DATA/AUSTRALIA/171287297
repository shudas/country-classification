the sadness you feel when the only tea that's left is Earl Grey, which while we're here, tastes like rusty arseholes.
If God wants to kill a man, no one can save him. If God wants to save a man, no one can kill him. If Maroon 5 is playing, God wants you dead
Sitting in a doctor's waiting room and a Maroon 5 'best of' is playing?

Why? What have I done to deserve this? I wish I were dead.
All these contrarian dickheads rubbishing Starwars. Get in the bin, losers. It's good, you're bad.
It's a positive sign of the times that people like Stacey Eden are lauded as heroes.
Good content on the old Periscope from @dannolan this morning.
Hearing chatter that a certain famous Warlock made tentative steps towards a comeback trail last night.
How is there not more buzz about this new Hasselhoff video? It's fucking amazing! https://t.co/9xBsGxlwLz
Friendly Bangladeshi man dropped off my new washing machine tonight. I asked him what his accent and heritage was, genuinely interested.
LIVE on #Periscope: There may come a day when the strength of men fails... But it is not this day. Fuck you, coffeeâ€¦ https://t.co/XKI6ytEq7D
Hey @kateiselin it just fit in my car. Also this is a methy fucking suburb. Pray for me. http://t.co/sjaJ41d3qc
My promise to the world - when my rap career blows up, I won't start tweeting in all caps.
I like Nao. https://t.co/SI32icfPyh
When you see a Twitter person on OkCupid but you don't view their profile because that's lurking.
hearing chatter that @fazmuffin is slowly becoming a Twitter chronic after his taste of fame with #freshinourmemories.
The leader of our country @TonyAbbottMHR is a literal human-iguana hybrid. You can't make this stuff up.
I played a game of @PlayHearthstone on the train on the way to work. Welcome to the future, friends.
I have to go to Parramatta tonight. Is there any good found out there for takeaway eats? I'll be driving. Help?
Thank you for convincing me to watch Daredevil, internet friends. It is very good.
Goddamn Crisis is a good album.
I am inclined to make a bullshit, next level, out of bounds, on point, hot fire, huge lasagne this weekend.
I think I am finally delivered from this awful flu ðŸ˜€
I watched a few good bits on Boomers tonight. Kinda seems like a problem that's solving itself. The mortal coil and all.

#BREAKING - Kanye's Armenian concert shut down when it awoke a giant lake troll from 1000 years of sleep and it destroyed a nearby village
I wouldn't enjoy Russia. Aside from my rampant (barely active) bisexuality, I love political memes.

The Kingpin's love interest in Daredevil is the 'just in cases' woman from Love Actually, right?
I want to live in a world where AoF never broke up, Dallas Green never became a bell-end doing records with P!NK and I get free tacos daily.
Let me introduce you to rap... https://t.co/xtUlnwTDMu
Tonight I have to finish a gaming piece titled "How becoming a god made me realise I'm dying." :/
People say and do stupid shit where ice cream is concerned.
Suspicious that @derridalicious doesn't enjoy ANY food because her tastebuds were burned off years ago by inhuman consumption of chillies.
Gaytimes are average @derridalicious, but not bad. I know I usually come out strong with an opinion, so sorry to disappoint.
Walk in the club like I'm not your friend, I'm just a man who knows how to feel. http://t.co/2glPe5Nf4r
Do I abscond to Europe or the U.S for a month in November or do I do a few weeks surfing in the Cook Islands sooner? Hmmm....
The only way to avoid this happening again is full communism.
Woolworths are no better than the florists who set up in Martin Place and charged $25 per flower after the Sydney Siege.
That Splendour line up is the most Triple J thing of all time. An avalanche of mediocrity.
Oh shit. Hearthstone is out on iPhone. RIP.
Lest we ever forget the most ill-advised marketing campaign of all time. #freshinourmemories 2015.â€¦ https://t.co/S8c1RM62sC
Excuse me, I do not appreciate my terrible sailor mouth being censored! Which one of you treacherous dogs quoted me?

I had to do this. I'm sorry. http://t.co/i1vkoanjvJ
.@woolworths, mates. I've experienced a new emotion. Amusement and rage. Amusage. You, dull prats. HOW did you think this was a good idea?
I thought funny internet people came up with the 'Fresh' bit. Nope, just marketing idiocy.
hahahahahahahaha Fresh In Our Memories. INSANE.
Just saw my first full month's pay. The amount I lose in tax to this criminal government!
*dies*
Good names for an Australian joint currency with New Zealand...? Go!
bleach is mostly water
and we are mostly water
therefore, we are bleach.

This is a good tune but don't have a song about your dick include the lyrics "no place for hiding, no place to run." http://t.co/tDOUd3s78S
Peripheral friend: "Why do you draw on your finger, Tom?"
Me: "It's a tattoo :( "
My bros who reference their "struggle" overcoming their internalised misogyny - stop doing that. It's not hard and we're also not done.
A man can never have too many black hoodies in his life. New threads en route! http://t.co/MdPXfabMHG
Today is brand new Brand New day. If you don't know what that lens, get the fuck out of my life you terrible human.

YES! New @gallowsofficial album!
I am not paying $10 for a game called "I am Bread." Piss off, Steam.
More like Stanis BROatheon am I right, guys?
It's #qanda night and I'm too ill to summon the wherewithal to harass @kateiselin while she watches. Sorry punters. Next week.
Saw a dude let all the ladies out of the elevator first. I have not been doing this. I think I'm a bad person.
How good is pseudoephedrine hydrocloride though? Not just for making meth, but also for when you've got a mad flu. METH IS BAD DON'T MAKE IT
