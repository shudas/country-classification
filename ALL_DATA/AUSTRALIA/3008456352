Was meant to work today. Fortunately for me I follow the @WillHillWolf Amanpouring myself a drink today and relaxing. Thanks @WillHillWolf
What a day of racing. Amanpour, Capodecina winning and huge runs from my other favourites Brewery and Rustic Melody
I tore into it. Kicking over furniture and shiz right now!
Good luck to @Leesracing with Rustic Melody in The Oaks. Her dad Snitzel would be proud. Great training effort
I want a cartoon wolf to run across the screen when @WillHillWolf picks a winner on @7Mate_TV Great marketing ploy I think @WillHillAus
U have to try @TopBetta . A Tournament punting site for racing and sports. Free and paid entry tournaments. Upto the challenge?
Stoked that @Leesracing has Rustic Melody in The Oaks. She is one if my favourites. Great training effort. http://t.co/8GB9SaEOJi
Come on Rustic Melidy http://t.co/pYOgddi89V
For fuck sake make up your mind nowra
Why can't @SkyRacingAU have the last 400m of Sydney and Melbourne races like tvn used to. Replayed on you tube. They are so behind the times
Think I found my porch seat @GaiWaterhouse1 should get one for Tulloch lodge http://t.co/fSLkTKPWps
There is no way they could have raced The Championships today. Although I have seen races in more extreme conditions http://t.co/w4YRP8gMtl
There is seriously a jockey named Lee Attard riding today at the gold coast.serious?Leotards went out along time ago http://t.co/IAP1qc2pPL

Great day of racing yesterday @racing_nsw should be proud.Good to not hear complaints about track. Was in great condition
Wings was a great tip @WillHillWolf can't believe the price. Would have loved the win but smashed it ew so still wrapped. Thanks
Miss u on our boy Malachi mate. Wish u had the ride if he got into the TJ Stakes. I owe u a beer for the 10 or so mortgages payments uz made

#Gibraltar Rock finally breaks through to win his maiden. More seconds than a minute that poor horse

I hope deep field gets beat today. I like the horse but don't think Tommy berry should be on him. Put @brentonavdulla. back on
The only thing I have eyes for this weekend http://t.co/k0844w6WBb
Wine tales fails again. I jumped off it 2 starts ago. Too bad my mate's didn't
So I get money from @BetEasy within 6 hours but I'm still waiting for yesterdays winnings from @WillHillAus. Ridiculous
Does Tommy berry ever show vigour on a fave? I'm not throwing my hard earned on him anymore
