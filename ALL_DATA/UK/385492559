I might go into new look to tell Hannah about last night just cause she'll have something worse to make me feel better

Ronnies birthday on Saturday and I've no idea what to get him
when your pals owes you about £400, a new bed and toilet seat and you've never seen a penny back its time to rethink your friendship 🌚

ronnie is literally my life saver right now
needing to lie in my bed and think about hings for a while myself like
never laughed this much for a Sunday night in my life
nothing gives me the fear more than watching Hannah when she's absolutely mwi
I'm one of they cunts who come to a house party and make themselves a bowl of soup
