Harrison Ford in the new Star Wars trailer?  Hmmm.  I wonder if my lovely will be interested?  ðŸ˜œ
Did ok in the ol' hockey pool tonight.  Nice.
I have not played hide &amp; go seek in a long time.  This is kinda fun.
If Nugent-Hopkins &amp; Yakupov went over to Europe injured, the #Oilers organization would be rightly roasted for allowing it.
For all #Oilers &amp; Leafs fans frustrated with your franchises, please allow me to introduce you to...Boston.

Just...wow.
What a stunning morning in our city.  #yeg
Hmmm.  Kyle Platzer w his 1st 2 pro goals for OKC, tonight.  #Oilers
Pretty OK blue-line, I'd say...
#Oilers  https://t.co/lplBB54VoB
How cool that #Oilers C Anton Lander will play for Sweden at Worlds!  How far his career has come since October...
I'm encouraged that goaltending seems to be job #1 for the #Oilers.  I believe they need to fix their issues from the back, forward.
I agree w MacT:  don't forecast Nurse &amp; Draisaitl as AHL starters. That's disincentive. You want them trying to make your big club.  #Oilers
While I agree with the Yak deal &amp; congratulate the player, Nail would do well to buy Todd Nelson &amp; Derek Roy a nice steak dinner.  #Oilers
Congrats, @Nail10_1993 well deserved.  #Oilers
A very intelligent $ and Term from MacT.  #Oilers https://t.co/7wHV1XD87T
COLUMN:  Edmonton Oilers Player Grades - Games 1-82 http://t.co/HyCscKASL8
MacT media avail at 2pm today.  This should be interesting.  #Oilers
That was surely fun, this morning, but I am now re-setting my alarm from when it went off this morning:  3:45am.  Sure scared the dog, tho!
A 2-year contract for Yakupov would be a very solid decision by the #Oilers.
On-The-Air.  Haven't done THIS in a long time.  I think I remember how to drive the car!  ðŸ˜³
Very telling comments, from Yak on Nelson.  This is part of my thinking when I advocate for Nelson to be returned. https://t.co/EA719FihhB
If you think the way to fix the #Oilers is to clean house like TO, good luck with that...it would add 2+ years to the process.
My 13-Year-Old:  "Dad, do you have anything that you are surprised still works"?

Very nice recovery from Brandon Davidson, there, not a pretty sequence for him but ultimately got the job done.
There's another one right between Ben's pads.  Yes, Musil got beat to the outside, but at some point...you need a save.  #Oilers
Just turned the HNIC panel down, &amp; Jack and Bob up.  Friedman's common sense just not enough to save that runaway ego-show.
Holy hockey sticks what a weak call on Musil.  Wow.
5-3 #Oilers while Jim Hughson is busy visiting.
Terrible rebound by Miller, Pouliot &amp; Hall pounce.  3-2 #Oilers
I thought it was a tell that the #Oilers wanted Derek Roy back for sure when they slapped an "A" on his jersey.
Glad to see MacT endorse 4, 10, 14 &amp; 93.  Don't see this organization progressing without them.  And for the right price &amp; terms, sign 8.
Jim Hughson is a really good play-by-play man.  But they should never allow him to call Canucks games.  He's just brutally 1-sided.
Way to go, @okcbarons !

#PlayoffBound
Marincin-Musil having their issues, so far.  Hmmm.
#YakCity Yeah, let's not re-sign ROy, no chemistry at all between 8 &amp; 10.  #Oilers
OK, boys...game #82.  Let's do this.

#Oilers
Wow, the amount of self-pleasuring going on in Vancouver, before tonight's #Oilers game, isn't annoying at all...
Report:  Hall, Eberle, Nuge &amp; Yak are "safe".  I also believe they should stay unless something remarkable is coming the other way.  #Oilers
No.  I mean he had a very good 2nd half and deserves to be selected.  Full stop. https://t.co/qnWCrxTigu
God I loved Gary Carter.  What a gamer. https://t.co/igcZsrGhqR
Reports of mutiny in LA don't surprise, welcome to 2015.  Shook my head each time a fan said the #Oilers needed tough love or "bag skate".
And then there were two!  #Oilers https://t.co/vbVw0t69Va
This is great, well deserved.  #Oilers https://t.co/LxZXJtOHJs
Way to go, @fitzy_nowradio &amp; The NOW! Family, on your #EMPTIESforANGELS campaign.  That semi is filling fast!  #Proud http://t.co/n3S5aj4exa
Red Sox set a franchise record, tonight, beat the Yankees in...wait for it...19 innings.  And I watched them all.  #TiredKurt
I absolutely love all of these "gee, that's a surprise, the numbers didn't suggest THAT" comments.  Hint:  It's why they play the games.
Laurent Brossoit to OKC.  Expected &amp; logical.  Fasth must be ready to return.  #Oilers
Classy. https://t.co/ubifD5VTrr

POST-GAME:  Laurent Brossoit Brilliant in Edmonton #Oilers 3-1 Loss To The San Jose Sharks http://t.co/gzjXtmLPt7
What a terrific performance by Brossoit tonight.  My post-game #Oilers "9-Things" column is coming up @OilonWhyte
Keith Aulie just got absolutely scorched there.  Enough, MacT.  Enough.  Uncle.  Uncle.  #Oilers
Wow.  Just...wow.  LB.
I'm genuinely happy for Winnipeg Jets fans.  Never should have lost their NHL team to begin with.  Good for them.
PP on the Hall trip.  #4 was flying down the wing.
Shots 14-14 in the 2nd.  Appropriate that the only goal so far would come on a give-away.  #YakCity
#YakCity
Better period for the #Oilers so far, and now a PP...
Spectacular 1st for Brossoit with 19 saves.  Reasons #1, #2 &amp; #3 why it's just 0-0 after one.  #Oilers
LB has been terrific, so far.  No sign of nerves.  #Oilers
Great PK, boys!  Kills off the major.  #Oilers
Nice stuff on Pavelski, LB.  #Oilers
That's a BS 5-minute major against Curtis Hamilton.  Should have been 2, yes, but no more.  Not here to watch you, Zebras.
Ok boys...lets do this!  #Oilers
OK, over to the #Oilers game.
That should be a good goal in Calgary.
...and yes, I will have another post-game "9-Things" #Oilers column, after tonight's SJ game, @OilonWhyte as well!
TYou for Asking: My regular 10-game cell #Oilers ratings will be out after Game #82, at #OilonWhyte. Figured no one would mind a "12 gamer"!
Congrats to Brad Hunt, on being named 1st Team AS in the AHL.  #Oilers
Floor tickets to Ringo Starr?  Check. Scratch one more thing off the 'ol bucket list...
I've said it before, I'll say it again:  I'll take the post-Xmas version of the #Oilers over that tire-fire in Toronto any day of the week.
I long ago lost my interest in golf, but I still will stop and respectfully watch Jack Nicklaus fire a hole-in-one on a Par 3 at the Masters
Also makes sense to give LB a start here, in a game irrelevant in the standings, to either team involved.  #Oilers
Classy moves by the #Oilers, to start Richard Bachman last night, &amp; then get him home to OKC for the birth of his child.
Now that the #Oilers have "clinched" 28th place, hopefully those "fans" cheering for them to lose can crawl back into their holes.

POST-GAME:  Edmonton #Oilers Stun Kings 4-2, All But Dash L.A.'s Playoff Hopes. http://t.co/eXx1tyGiHG
My post-game #Oilers columns resume tonight @OilonWhyte. So far, lots of positives. Kings looks a little tired, maybe gassed from last night
Doesn't look like Pitlick is quite in game shape, sucking wind pretty hard at the end of each shift.
Very good period for the boys.  Right with the Kings so far.
OK, boys...lets do this.  And by "do this", I don't mean like the last time the #Oilers played LA.
The last trip to Rexall for The Kid &amp; I this season.  The W/L aside, we'll miss our #Oilers in the off-season.
Makes good sense to play Pitlick if he's able.  #Oilers need to decide what to do with the guy.  Miller, a strong prospect, has passed him.
I could watch 3 baseball games in a row, easy.  Still love the sport, even though losing the #Expos took some passion out of it for me.
#SaveSunnyvale #TPB @trailerparkboys
The #Oilers ink D Joey LaLeggia to an amateur try-out in OKC.  Will probably play w the Barons this Spring.  Has JSchultz offensive skill.
As much as I love my cottage &amp; holidays, there is no better place in the world than a radio station at 5 in the morning.
Seems I picked a good 3-game stretch to be away for?  My post-game #Oilers columns return Tuesday, @OilonWhyte.  Hope their game does, too.
Bald Eagle, waiting for the ferry, Pender Island, B.C. http://t.co/L28ljKyjUH
Ok boys...let's do this!  #Oilers
Way to go, @EdmontonOilers from Pender Island, B.C.!  Nice win, boys!! #Oilers
Seriously?  Carrie Fischer beat out Danielle Smith for the PC nomination?? http://t.co/cdflYBziYe
This "Country Band" just played a 3-song set consisting of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Tom Petty and Bonnie Raitt.  I think we need to have a talk...
Oh, look, Corey Hirsch is on #HNIC.  Y'know...he's really not developing very well as an analyst.  #Oilers
Walking to the bar in a T-shirt.  The Daffodils are up &amp; the apple trees are in bloom.  Ummm...I don't think I'm in Kansas anymore.
Hello, ocean.
Holidays.  Cottage, here we come.

That was...by far and away...the most I have enjoyed an @EdmontonOilers game all season.
Bachman's Turning It Into Overdrive.  #Oilers
Heck of a period by our guys.  Depleted lineup, but they "played big".  I sure like how these kids work for Todd Nelson.  #Oilers
Ok boys...let's DO this!!

#Oilers
Hi Shawn Horcoff.  Will never forget how well you treated my kid that time.  Will always cheer for you.  #Oilers http://t.co/jpwM3XjbOc
Wow, that's cool.  Derek Roy wearing an "A" tonight, with Ference hurt.  #Oilers
Orange Toque Night at Rexall Place!  @CathieLeavins #Oilers http://t.co/iONzueGIN9
I'd like nothing better than for Sabres fans cheering for opposing teams in their own barn to finish last...and then lose the draft lottery.
This depleted #Oilers lineup will need a tremendous effort, tonight.  Their results more likely to be measured by character than the score.
Injury-riddled OKC Barons sign 40 year old David Ling to PTO.  Ling has played 93 NHL games, with Montreal, Columbus.  #Oilers
Sabres Mike Weber: "Your home fans cheering against you, this is a whole new low right now".  RT - THIS is what it does to your players
Sooo...what...no tax on back-handed passes up the middle??  #abbudget #Oilers
