My thanks to @TheGnarlyGnome for his charity at @BraxtonBrewCo - Here's to honoring #LaurenHill by paying it forward on this #DayofKindness
That hour is what's required to clean &amp; dry the tanks for the next brew. Sounds like someone needs more room - @BraxtonBrewCo #LiftOneToLife
Was just informed that for the past month the tanks at @BraxtonBrewCo have only been empty an hour at a time #LiftOneToLife

.@moerleinbeers tells me that a brewery will be there every time to tap the beer and talk with @Reds fans
Cool new news from @moerleinbeers &amp; @Reds - Fridays at GABP will be 'Firkin Fridays' for every home game
Barring #cincywx I'll be on @WCPO tonight talking about #CincyMade beer - does this make me #CincyFamous?
