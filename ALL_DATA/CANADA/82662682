A baseball presser en francais... America's not ready for this one.
What's getting tossed first a jersey or some waffles? #TMLtalk @Simpy82 @TheReveree
So what does Russell Martin at $82 million offer that Dioner Navarro doesn't for $3 million?  Don't get these #Jays.
Is that not backwards? http://t.co/wBBZLAkyEM
Was that Bernier in net, or a Shooter Tutor? #TMLtalk
Some great seats just released for Brad Paisley.  #WorkTweet
Antonio Gates just pushed off on that moth.  #TNF
Any acknowledgement of today's events in #Ottawa by the @mlb ?  Watched majority of #WorldSeries game and haven't heard any mention...

Wow.  Only took 2.5 games for Clay Matthews to get injured this year.  Impressive.  #Packers
The Q&amp;A portion of this Roger Goodell presser is gonna be pure gold.  Pop your popcorn, folks.
I never check my iPhone 6 order status hourly.  #Never
.@MLB you so bad!  #StroShow
I believe I just washed my tv remote.  Can't make that stuff up, folks.
Ray Lewis gets a statue, Ray Rice gets fired.  Paradox?
Apparently spending $400 on a putter and having the grip split within 8 months is my fault. Thx for the great customer service @GolfTown ygk

Two @porterairlines flights in the last 72 hours.  Two deplanings, three airplanes, and five hours of total delays. Thx for valuing MY time.
Heaven or.... the Soo!  #Sunnyside http://t.co/XDQNBcrPNq
Josh Gordon gets a year for substance abuse violations, and Ray Rice gets two games for knocking out his wife. Makes sense.

All the wankers are coming out of the woodwork tonight.  #WorldCup2014
If this game never ends, I'm OK with that. #NHLplayoffs
I'm thinking Rory McIlroy is strutting around the Memorial humming 99 problems all day.  #hova #HesBack
Having to watch a 30 second ad before a 60 second video...never frustrating.

I find it odd that EVERY @MLB team plays on #MemorialDay, but they can't schedule Canada's ONLY team to play on Victoria day.
I'd rather see a no hitter from John Rocker than Josh Beckett.
There's a pot of gold somewhere on Wolfe Island.  #ygk http://t.co/k2XqOALbkJ

Big congrats to Teddy Nolan! While fully deserving of a lifetime contract from the @BuffaloSabres I'm sure he's happy to settle for 3 years!
This Raptors game is ridiculous...20 mins to play the last 45 seconds.  #FigureItOut
Ranger is actually turning around because he totally over skates the puck, yet Killorn ignores puck and runs player through the boards...Hmm
