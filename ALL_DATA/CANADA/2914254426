Flames secret weapon = Samuel Bennett.
The kid can play.
Welcome to the 3rd period #Canuck fans. 2-1 #Flames!
Hughson's not happy Brody evaded that check.
Sounds like Hughson's mad at Yanick Webber.
Ferland redemption!
The best part of the Flames game has been drawing penalties not taking them.  Yesshhhh!
I think this Bennett kid might be okay.
Wish brandon Prust was still a Flame.
What channel is this on (Shaw)?
Watching TSN1 "The Butterfly Child". Jonathan Pitre's Story.
I'm in awe.

I fucking hate the Oilers.  Idiotic goal!!
And now watching the Oliers game.
3 - 1 Oilers.  I'm serious!
#oilers all of Calgary is behind you tonight.  Win cause it will never happen again.

Good stuff.
#flames shut out the the oilers.  Nice work Hiller!
Potter is a better defensemen than Engelland.  And 3x less money to boot.
Queue the sounds of Edmonton packing it in.  2 - 0 #Flames.
Col tied up with LA.
Took advantage of the great whether to clean out the garden beds.  Weeks ahead of schedule!
So I've had a lot of drinks tonight, and as hopeful as I was at 3 - 1.  I'm now looking forward to a sober next game.
Screw the Stars and their playoff hopes!
#Flames game is playoff tense!
Anyone know if Patrick is related to former Flame Mike Eaves?
Really pissed at Hiller right now.  Looking for his stick and not the puck.
Charlie Simmer told me that the #Flames are moving their feet and getting pucks to the net.
Top shelf Johnny Gaudreau!
How is this the same #Flames team from the 1st half of the 2nd period?
#NHL embarrassment.  3-way Tank job is is the NHL's fault and is a black mark on the integrity of the league. http://t.co/klfeA2oXzE
The NHL should change the draft lottery.

Get the feeling that Ferland would have provided the same answer regardless of the the question asked in the intermission.
Flames app reporting that Ferland goal was unassisted?
#Flames vs Wild - Ramo can't do it alone. http://t.co/posuUK03Qx via @MatchsticksCGY
#Flames1stGoal it's Paul Byron tonight!
ARI 4 - BUF 3 final.  Buffalo is the greatest tank nation of all time.  #TankForMcEichel
ARI 3 - BUF 2 - 6 min remaining.  Yotes are going to have to pull the goalie soon.  #NHLtankNation
Devan Dubnyk had a .974 Sv% last week.  Glad he's not an Oiler anymore.

Take that Varlamov and your 96% save percentage.
Stempniak scored to make it 2-0.  Ex-Flames killing us lately.  That and the Oilers suck.
WPG 1 EDN 0 so far.
Beginning to believe in David Jones.  He's been good over the last 1/2 of this year.
Anyone but Rene Bourque!
Happy Engelland is not on for 4v4.
Bollig has been good tonight.  I hope I don't regret writing that.

If I were to build an NHL team, I'd build it the way the Blues are built.  Great team.
