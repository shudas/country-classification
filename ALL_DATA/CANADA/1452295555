What was the last sentence of @sjokz in #PTL?
Or maybe I just decided to pick champ who have a better impact (Heca/wu)
IDK I'm either good or super lucky recently in soloQ.

Dear solo Q players if you see the summoner Deathdelf in your team, better dodge, the guy just left a game after 5 minutes #LeagueOfLegends
First promo game, cho top saying that he will afk.

On a less serious note I want a grill

Played against a Renekton Smite/TP. It's incredibly strong. Hopefully I had trundle  (9/4/15)
The last @RLewisReports video is really good and I'd like that to football (soccer) where it's a problem when ppl are bigger than the team
Je revois les compositions du FCN et c'est évident qu'on peut pas marquer si on a pas de milieu de terrain

TBH urf is not that fun when you see all the time the same bullshit. 
Would be funnier for me if you could ban more champ
