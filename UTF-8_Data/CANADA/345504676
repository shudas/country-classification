As an @NHLFlames fan, I never thought I would say this.....but considering tonight's situation, Go @EdmontonOilers Go
I'm more nervous about the @NHLFlames now than I was in the 2004 run. Go Flames Go! #Ignited #PlayoffPush
Well I was hoping to play some GTA Online, but I can't because once again, as usual, the @RockstarGames servers are not working
What really pisses me off is how LA are beating Calgary on loser points.
Congratulations to @KenneyMo7 on his first career AHL goal in his first career AHL game. @AHLFlames #OKCvsADK
I swear Engelland is not supposed to be able to play like this, but I love it! #Ignited #DALvsCGY @NHLFlames
