Amazing end to this week, after mowing through assignments!
4 assignments done in the last week! Killed it!
Change one of my earlier tweets. We're 3rd! Not 4th! Didn't realised with the for and against!! #RedV #GreatWallOfKogarah
Can't believe the defence at the moment. Haven't been the best defensive team since 2010!
And conceded only 64 points in 6 games! Amazing!
And we're 4th!
I do enjoy a round of footy when the Dragons win and Roosters and Souths both lose! #winning
Suck shit Souths! #scumoftheearth
Can't get over that.
And the bias towards Souths is ridiculous.
Cowboys always get rorted.
What a joke of a no try! This refereeing gets worse and worse.
My baby with her new car!! 🚘💙🚙 @SarahKelley20 http://t.co/g6dka8uY4c
Such a nice 4 days away down in Kiama with my family and @SarahKelley20! So chilled and relaxing. Defs needed it!

Hurry up Thursday...
Who would have thought we'd be the best defensive team! #RedV #WeAreAllDragons
And at the end of round 5, the mighty @NRL_Dragons have conceded the least amount of points out of any team! #TheGreatWallOfKogarah
Melbourne are awesome to watch!
Honestly, I can't believe how poor and inconsistent the NRL refereeing is. So fed up with such nonsense.
What an atrocious performance from the Roosters. #lolz
JACK BIRD! What a talent!
Are you kidding me that's a penalty! What an absolute joke.
What are this?!!
Roosters on struggle street. Cronulla controlling the game well.
Jack Bird! Wish he was still at the #RedV! Still cut we released him after his brilliant season last year.
Happy Easter! 🐥🐰🐣

The Great Wall Of Kogarah! Can't believe this 2010 like defence! #WeAreAllDragons #RedV @NRL_Dragons
Can't even believe what I just saw. So done with the NRL, it's refereeing and any cost for Souths to win every week. Absolutely ridiculous.

Gutsy win! And huge effort! So fired up!
What about that defence!!
Gutsy performance from the Eels! Against all the shit refereeing decisions too! Such shit $ouffs!

If that's a raised knee I'm so done.
The NRL is officially an absolute joke. Can't even believe that.
