Modern trucks have a much smaller environmental impact than before. #ontruck #trucking #cleanidle. More economical to run.
Today's trucks require skilled technicians to keep them running smoothly. #ontruck #trucking
Many career options in #trucking. Warehouse to IT and all in between.   Lots of opportunities for skilled professionals. #ontruck
My first event is fast approaching.   Peel Skills Competition. #ontruck Show that #trucking is a great career choice.
