So in reverse order I'd guess... 

HK

Of course I might be a little biased. 
#WBC2015
Finally.... The awards ceremony begins... Kind of... Sponsors go for gold... #WBC2015
Spot on! Well done Sasa! Awesome presentation at #WBC2015 with maybe the only issue being a little bit of wastage from the grinder.
Alrighty.... here we go.... COME ON SASA! #WBC2015
Other than not filling the caps, USA gave a really professional #WBC2015 performance. Seemed to really flow.
Time for USA to do their bit at #WBC2015 ... Think maybe France is in the lead so far...
UK barista champion tried to break the 4th wall by talking about the scoresheet, but ended up waffling on a bit too much. #WBC2015
Time for the UK to strut their stuff at the #WBC2015
France really performed well in the #WBC2015 finals. Great focus on temperature. Really tight presentation. Tough one to judge.
Like a flag fall in a taxi, my brain has switched on. I guess it doesn't care that it is only 3am. Welcome to Monday and a brand new week.
