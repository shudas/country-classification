Is there a name for a SHG and a PPG on the same PP? How about a Morty? Rhymes with shorty and Corsi. #nhl #HNIC

A billionaire white man beats, humiliates a working-class woman. Who wrote the script? Lenin? Che? Margaret Atwood? #FiftyShades of red?
Deleting Myers,Stafford,adding Bogo should help @buffalosabres fend off the Leafs in the Kursk-like Tank warfare for lottoMcDavid odds
02/07 I tweeted at @FriedgeHNIC jets could trade Kane to a tanking team for a top 6 fwd. I was thinking @BuffaloSabres, #lovebeingright
Lol #Leafs .
I like unconventional. @PeteCarroll was a mad genius going for TD at end of the first half. But being counter-intuitive has limits #SB49

Sick of Liberal rule in #onpoli? Thank #ONPC for making Hudak's RW lunacy the alternative. PC's paid a steep price for their #TeaParty
Hudak bringing back child labour?  Those times-table challenged #discoverymath grads are about 11 or 12. #onpoli #ONdebate #coalminesawait
Hudak job interview: You have 3 s to tell me what 7*6 is.  Too slow, job goes to Asia, blame McGuinty's math curriculum. #onpoli #ONdebate
Hudak said he;s not firing nurses, teachers, EA's/ECE's  What jobs do the lucky 100k now hold?  There's not many left. #onpoli #ONdebate
So Tim Hudak feels qualified to trash the math curriculum, Yet his plan says (-)100 000 = (+) 1 000 000. Splendid #ONdebate #onpoli
