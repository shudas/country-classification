As a #smallbusiness we have found that new initiatives never happen as quickly as you want them. Sometimes that is a good thing!
Thanks for the follow @STARBENDERS! We happen to be a small design &amp; manufacturing company with a secret affinity for punk rock.
Everyone agrees that #LessIsMore. So why are many #safetyproducts so complicated &amp; yet do so little? #C3SafetyRope http://t.co/ZuVBp95K74
Thanks for the follow back @FMI_ORG! We sincerely appreciate all you do to help pair retailers and grocers with solutions providers. 👏👍😃

Bonjour! @LeTownTalk is our new favorite #restaurant in South #Minneapolis and that is all. We just thought you should know. 👍
The nickname "Fast Eddie" sounds cool. "Fast C3 LLC"—less so. Comforting because new products always take us longer to develop than we want.

Work hard, do good and be peaceful.
Don't just, "open more coffee shops"—trying to grow your #smallbusiness through multiplication (alone) without #innovation will fail.

If you're a #smallbusiness, it means you don't need to, "set a meeting to outline an agenda."—Never underestimate the power of being nimble.
The goal shouldn't be, "to eliminate the competition." The goal should be to become the best at what you do and then #compete with yourself.

Yesterday was #LabourDay—though a Monday still a fun day. Now it's back to work on #Tuesday, just another wear a shirt and shoes day.
Our goal as a #smallbusiness was to become something and then become a better version of ourselves.—We're still working on that second part.
