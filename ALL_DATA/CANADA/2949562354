Apparently I ensure the garbage is at the curb at 7am to allow ample time for the animals to tear into it @_kawarthalakes_ @919bobfm
If you're going to take your dog on to a school yard, PLEASE clean up afterwards! Kids play there! Don't be ignorant!
Today's problem - I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up #BeingAnAdultSucks
