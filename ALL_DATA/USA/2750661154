MASS TWEET PSA: IM PERFECTLY OKAY
people that text or call after a tweet are my favorite. #thnxforcaring
you guys are gonna get close and I'll just be left in the dust, but hey, as long as you're happy it's cool.
I didn't try whatsoever today so sorry if you see me👌🏼
just feel better
I'm that person who will laugh at something that wasn't even funny for like 20 minutes.
I also fell outside of the locker room thanks to aj and landed right on my butt so my tailbone bruise is a lot bigger😂😂 #alwayshurtdammit
I bent my knee and it popped six times and now I can't feel it or walk. WTF ALL I DID WAS BEND???
tieler is honestly my favorite human being ever
