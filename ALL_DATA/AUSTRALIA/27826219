Omg @Jsene_Lefao you poor thing. I can't believe you got injured. Hope you recover quickly. Take care of yourself xx
Nice work as Captain Ballin tonight @mattballin9 - see you next week #gomanly
Guess what!! If a player is off contract Manly have signed them.... Bloody hell give us a break.
Is that what they call a birds eye view @AndrewVossy ?
Woo hoo @mattballin9 that's great news. So thrilled you re-signed.
Come on Manly
Hey @mase21 how is Blake after you jumped on his back?
Has Kieran SIGNED or agreed to terms?
Well done to @SeaEagles putting the boys on the big screen singing the team song. Awesome. People stopped in their tracks to watch it.
Does @RLW_Mole happen to know if Foz is announcing his decision this Friday?
