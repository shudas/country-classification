Arya's storyline is by far the most fun one in season 5 so far. #GoT
Does "red velvet" sound like "lemon poppy seed"? Apparently this guy at Tim's thought so. Ugh. #notwhatiwanted
So all the Jets playoffs games are on Sportsnet, which I need to pay to get? Lame.

Incredibly easy cleaning at the dentist today thanks to #SoniCare!
It's perfect,  really... @NHLJets get in to the playoffs,  and it's snowing outside. #GoJetsGo #wpgwhiteout
"get those white shirts out,  baby"  -  @BiggieFunke #GoJetsGo #WPGwhiteout
Hate to rely on another team losing to get in,  but thanks @NHLFlames.
Hey TSN3, I don't want to watch the Jets lose again immediately after watching them lose.
Fucking shootouts.
Fuck.  "@NHLJets: He's stopped."
3 shutouts in 3 games for Pavs. #GoJetsGo
#GoFlamesGo
All Avs.
So many freaking blocked shots.
Gotta find some heart meds. #GoJetsGo
It was over the line! #gojetsgo
FUCKING WHEELER!
ONE MINUTE!
Everyone take a drink, they mentioned Meyers' long stick.  #GoJetsGo #Beyakdrinkinggame
UGH!
Damn it @NHLFlames
Avs actually look hungrier. Are quicker to the puck, and more aggressive. #GoJetsGo
I wonder if Roy pulls Barra. Avs have nothing to lose. #GoJetsGo
Hahaha bench minor. Nicely done Roy. #GoJetsGo
Ooooookay... @NHLJets you need to score on THIS PP. #GoJetsGo #obvioustweets
Ugh...  0-0 games though... #GoJetsGo #chancesallovertheplace
Really really really don't like when COL cycles in our zone... #itjusttakesoneshot #GoJetsGo
Ha,  Chevy looks so anxious. #GoJetsGo
Hahaha @ALowsyPlayer17 next to @saraorlesky #GoJetsGo
It's like he @Avalanche only show up for the last minute of periods. #GoJetsGo
Perreault throws in the towel. #GoJetsGo
Nice dancing,  Stafford.  #GoJetsGo
Barra.
Okay, get something done on this PP.  #GoJetsGo
Oohhhh fucking great. Perreault is hurt. #GoJetsGo
Trouble needs to stop with the turnovers... #GoJetsGo
Come on, @NHLFlames. Do us a solid.
My heart.
Damn those Colorado boys can pass. #GoJetsGo
How about ol' 5-cup Huddy? #GoJetsGo
At least @mnwild are losing? #doesntreallymatterthough
Sloppy loose play means many minutes in their own zone. #GoJetsGo
The Jets look... Nervous? Tentative? #GoJetsGo
Gah! #GoJetsGo
11th short-handed goal? I think so. #GoJetsGo
Game on. #GoJetsGo
Apologizing in advance for the upcoming @NHLJets game tweets. #gojetsgo #WPGvsCOL
