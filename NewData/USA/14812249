that's 6 more votes than Harrington, Burling, Riley, Pittinari, Sarvas, and Serna got combined.
somewhat concerning that at least 6 people voted for Juan Ramirez for MOTM against Dallas. i thought he has a pretty terrible game.

Looks like Deshorn Brown got his 2nd start last friday, no goals, subbed out.  His club tied 1-1 &amp; now have 4 points from 2 games #Rapids96

and they've already left games early.
they showed me pics of them meeting a player, they didn't know who it was. It was Pittinari.
wish i could afford a second season ticket so i could bring them to more games myself. i skip games now to get xtra tix to bring the kids.
they have access to free tix now and offering to take my kiddo's with them to games. i love that for my kids, good for them.
honestly, very cool for them. can't help but be jealous though, as a multi-year season ticket holder, sounds like they've got it nice!
they went from not knowing who the Rapids were to box seats, meeting players, wearing their gear, game tickets, free shwag....
we have neighbors who work for TransAmerica, their daughter is friend w/my kids. lets just say the Rapids are DEFINITELY taking care of them
