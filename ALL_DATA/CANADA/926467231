100% http://t.co/stgLdGeJ4R
where do we begin now that you're back from the dead
momma made banana muffins and they're fresh out of the oven and im having one and i am in heaven atm
im going to save every single penny from my next few paychecks &amp; then go out on a huge shopping spree &amp; not have to worry about my spending
idk but I absolutely love Kid Ink.. looool
people that complain yet put forth no effort into making themselves feel better but would rather bask in their own sadness make me mad
I love being short because I am the perfect height to receive forehead kisses, hehehehh
I wish I was at a cute coffee shop sipping coffee sitting outside enjoying this weather
everything feels so right when im with you.
I've been craving boneless bites for months and I finally satisfied my craving and I am beyond content with my life right now
im all yours.
just casually ordered for a pickup at Gabe's from work so that when im done I can run over and get myself dinner lol..
I definitely shouldn't have said I could work 1-8 today.. pooooooop.
I need to get up and get ready to go but my dog is all snuggled into me and I don't wanna disturb him
you know you like it but it drives you insane.
Ahhh hockey boys are sooo stinky
excited to be seeing him again today 🙊😍
Tbh, I love my job at the canteen so much it's so chill and relaxed its awesome
someone definitely pissed in my cornflakes this morning cause I am nooooot having a good day.
but when am I not half naked walking through my house scaring my family from my nudeness ? yeah idk either.
weeeellll, say it ain't so.
don't let yourself be defined by what society has labelled you as. You are so much more than that.
you are not your illness.
picture perfect in a broken frame.
fuck you and your bad vibes.
we all have our own personal demons we battle with everyday.
so glad I won't have to see you everyday once I graduate.
I wanna be in a bed cuddling and eating junk food, noooot at school wtf.
&amp; I think I'm gonna make myself some onion rings...👌☺️
im at work in sweats and a tshirt blasting music reading my book doing absolutely nothing. #ilovemyjob
don't wanna fuck this up, &amp; don't wanna get fucked up from this.
oh god, i am so fucked.
I've never been very fond of phone calls cause I find they're really awkward, but I could spend hours on the phone with you.
got me feeling some type of way
I've spent years building up my walls &amp; it's scary how easily you knocked them down.
there hasnt been one photo on my insta that had me smiling with my mouth closed, then all of a sudden the past 4 posts my mouth is closed
there's a riot in me.
happy birthday beautiful little lady 💘 @AveryMatheson00 🎉🎊🎈 have an amazing day!
just wanna be good enough for you.
Ive been told the past 3 shifts Ive worked that its gonna be my last shift since seasons ending, but I just got called into work again today
I finally have a few hours where I can sleep &amp; relax before work and ofc it's the day my whole family is awake and banging around the house😭
so thankful to have met you.
today couldn't have gone any better..❤️🙊😍 #sohappy
&amp; then one day, your name didn't make me smile anymore.
work 10-7 today.. 😩
someone recently mentioned to me that they thought I had big lips for my face and now I can't stop thinking about my lips being big...lool..
I will become an expert at guitar hero, fuck you allllllll 👋
excited to see him sunday!! :')
visiting my cousins is probably my favourite thing to do
not being able to see someone frequently makes the time you do see each other that much more special
"I've never met a hurricane quite like you."
cant use my front camera on my phone anymore cus its all cracked &amp; im pissed cus I was hoping I could get away without replacing the screen
i found a reason for me, to change who i used to be, a reason to start over new, and the reason is you.
I want to get my nose pierced and I want tattoos, and now that I have a job I can afford that.. Ohhhhh my parents are going to kill meeee..
you are not a bad person for the ways you tried to kill your sadness.
I ran like 60 metres half an hour ago, and I still have a cramp from it.. loool im dead
getting cute new underwear makes me so fucking happy
we'll make it work.
