Ah thought we had got away with Ed eyeballing us this time! #BBCDebate
I say to @Barnaby_M we can watch anything of his choosing for the next hour &amp; he puts on a recorded episode of University Challenge. 😅😅🙈

Hi @rugbyworldcup - I'm trying to buy tickets through official resale. What's the difference between "Currently Unavailable" and "Sold Out"?
I have just had a dreadful realisation. Mad Men is on at the same time as opening day of #TheMasters... #priorities
So many Mad Men spoilers 😤🙈🙈🙈
All the Green Party has done tonight is bore me senseless.... #leadersdebate
Just another note. Why did Ed not wear a red tie? I have no idea what party he stands for without a coloured tie! #leadersdebate
One thing I learnt as a law student is that we can trade in EEA without being in the EU. Why did no one mention this? #leadersdebate
All these foreigners, coming to Britain and marrying our politicians. #leadersdebate
Imagine if you could vote someone out after each round of questions like on The Voice. #leadersdebate
Can anyone actually look at Ed Milliband without cringing? #leadersdebate
Countdown to the FOUR DAY WEEKEND! Roll on 5pm... 🕔😃😃
Alien Autopsy on Sky1. What a film. 👍👍 @antanddec
#GE2015 isn't quite as bad as the SU elections were at Cardiff... Can't see Ed Milliband giving out free condoms for a vote anytime soon.🙈
Found my first grey hair 😢😢😢 #devastated
"@FootieWriter: Petr Cech has today confirmed that he will leave Chelsea at the end of the season. #CFC" @Barnaby_M

The King of Uganda is the same age as me. What.
So the terrier breeder from Scotland judges the Scottish Terrier as best in show?! Biased much?? Dublin should have won! #Crufts2015
Listening to Radio 2 by myself on a Saturday night. What has my life become? 🙈🙈
Bye bye @zanelowe 👋👋
When you have that Friday feeling but discover it's only Thursday. 👎👎

"@WelshRugbyUnion: #WalvEng travel advice http://t.co/CGlqXpkBVl" @Barnaby_M
It's been a looooooong week. #hellofriday 😚😚
Wonder what the chances are of @BBCR1 Big Weekend being in an LD postcode this year? #highlyunlikely
So yesterday I wrote off the car but today I gained a pair of Wales v England Six Nations tickets.... You win some, you lose some.
Does timing my lunch break to watch the start of Ronnie v Marco make me a man? 🎱🎱 #MastersSnooker
I love snow. ❄❄❄
There'll be no one left in #CBB before long...!
Don't Worry Be Yoncé ✌
What the hell is happening in Paris? What's wrong with people?? #JeSuisCharlie
Katie Hopkins in #CBB... What could possibly go wrong?
Those slimy money-grabbing bastards on #Broadchurch are exactly why I never wanted to be a lawyer.

The Interview is going to end up as the biggest selling film of 2014. All this on the news is brilliant publicity.

Wrong desicion @Lord_Sugar. They outsmarted you fair and square.
This Mark/Daniel rift on #TheApprentice is brilliant TV. So much tension.
It's December on Monday. It's not in any way appropriate to put up Christmas decorations until then. Just wait. 🎄
Dear @innoutburger, can you please open a restaurant in the UK? I can't afford a plane ticket to LA just for some animal fries. 😚
The countryside in winter: so cold but so pretty. #JackFrost ❄❄
