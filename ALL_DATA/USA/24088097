I want to keep track of how much I smoke a week but I'm scared to know.
I got to talk to my favorite person in the world tonight for the first time in months.
#StopMadonna2k15
my brother decided he was going to move after saying he wasn't and now I'm ridiculously sad
this purp is magical 🌈🌈
all I can think about lately is how lonely I am
can't wait for brand new to release their new album so I have new material to cry to
woke up to a new brand new song and that was super exciting
about me http://t.co/HyjKEOoKgV
was super excited to go home and then I remembered I didn't have my car 😭😭
I'm so butthurt with a lot of people and I'm probably gonna end 89% of my friendships today. over everyone
good morning 🌸
ISO new friends with no kids
every time I ask my dad to buy something for me he gets the wrong thing. every single time.
also I smoked in the parking lot at work cause I'm still 16 and I'm probably gonna get fired
work literally killed me today and I'm too tired to cry so I'm just laughing it off
the people I work with bring out the worst in me. I don't enjoy yelling and making scenes :(
😀
shout out to my best friend for spamming me with pictures of her baby 💕💕💕 http://t.co/VsYlkfqeaf
pms is sooo cool cause I totally love it when my boobs hurt
not stoked about working all weekend but I better make some money
really really really hungry
Aaron is eating all of our food
this is what adults in their early twenties do
made Aaron and sacia peanut butter and banana sandwiches. I'm such a great friend.
I just made myself sick by eating as I was watching this discovery show on parasites 😩
there's nothing that freaks me out more than parasites
why do I know so many people who are at country thunder?
trying to go to sleep but I'm so hungry
💔 https://t.co/Ybm0O3tV5K
I lost the book I was reading and I can't remember the title of the book. This is torture.
I just sent out a text and it made me laugh so much cause http://t.co/biJq1ZdSJA
got stuck watching some weird show
lol ok
my employees think I have all the time in the world. I'm trying to go home. been trying
so happy I have a bottle of vodka waiting for me at home. I hate my jobbbb
I lost track of time and just realized I'm seeing brand new next week. IM SEEING BRAND NEW NEXT WEEK.
Selena's been dead for 20 years and her family is still finding new ways to keep the money coming http://t.co/6jLVYAdKpY
lol @ people who think you have to be smart to enjoy watching the Big Bang theory
a quarter pounder from McDonald's sounds good. never thought I'd crave anything from McDonald's.that stoned..
I love going on vacation and coming back to horrible shifts
my last retweet killed me
last night I took some intense painkillers and had the best sleep of my life
I've done nothing in the last 4 days and my back hurts so much it's ridiculous. whyyy
Sasquatch still has a picture of me on his ig 😭
lol when you're driving next to the asshole who destroyed you 😊 like thanks universe
my lower back started to hurt dramatically welp
my little brother got fired from work and I'm really sad, I was only gone for 4 days wtf
no idea what the new emojis mean but me and bae are on fire I guess so that's cool?
finally back in az 🙏
saying bye to my mother always sucks 😭
there's so much more fucked up things happening in the world but you guys wanna waste your energy talking about Kylie Jenner. lol ok
I hate myself so much right now 😩
last night in mexico=last hot dog http://t.co/HUlQ4BPxhd
interstellar fucked me up
take me back to beach 💙 http://t.co/NjKELdiYjv
you'd think that if someone begs you to be their friend again that they'll try to do things right the second time around
people who lie about the smallest things are the worst kind of people.
v excited to have Mexican sushi tonight
I feel bad for everyone who's never had a Sonoran hot dog
good thing I've worked out so much in the last month so I can just come here and let myself go 😓
i feel like I only come to Mexico for hot dogs tbh
wish future bae had an iPhone so I could bug him all the way from Mexico :(
my cousin put my aunt on blast on facebook and even tagged her..😁
wow it's 10
just hopped over a wall and didn't beak anything :)
Getting drunk so early isn't fun and I'm trying so hard to not pass out
I love talking about my sex life among strangers
Calvin Harris and Taylor swift???!😐
ever feel like you found your soulmate but he doesn't even know it yet? it's kind of stressful
like you can hoe around after you have your baby, but can you focus on getting ready for your child?
Idk why pregnant woman have to post pictures of their butts and boobs on ig. I kinda hate that tbh
lose another day here lose another year here I'm with youuuu
my mom wants to go to the store but the fariseos are everywhere and they creep me out
can't stand clingy people, I've been gone for a day chiiiiiiill
I really wish my mom didn't live in Mexico cause this place suuuuucks
3 hours of sleep later and off we go. I hate road trips
tonight was tight and it's 4am and I'm pretty drunk packing
and they're pretty gay so they're probably right
Diego and Christian said that I look like a girl who's into girls. Probably explains why girls hit on me more than guys
when people meet my dad I feel like they expect some big cholo looking guy instead of a tiny 50 year old Colombian guy.
when you're lowkey crazy so you constantly hide how crazy you are along with all emotions so then everyone thinks you're a heartless bitch
as much as I hate my job I absolutely love my regulars
watched weird loners and I really hope I'm not still single at 34 😭
Fabian is literally always watching after everything I eat and it's kinda cool
words I live by @JENNIWOWW http://t.co/Dii9odni0K
technically I'm always ready for a nap
woke up way too early today to clean and I'm ready for a nap
why is everyone trying to make it harder for us to just listen to music? 😔
I'd be so mad
my brother called dominos like 5 minutes before they closed and the delivery guy was so happy and he had a big smile? what?
probably made like $250 today and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna throw up, working the patio is brutal
it's 2015 and it amazes me that because of who I am I lose opportunities to white people who can't even pick up their feet when they walk.
when the cooks know you're sad so they make you chilaquiles 😭❤️ http://t.co/FSTnVr1iQj
maybe when I go to Mexico this weekend I'll stay there forever
you know what's really fucking cool? actually doing your job and being a hard worker and being fucked over. surprise surprise
the exploited and the misfits? oh my god
running late for work Mondays is a thing for me now
savanna and I are going to bjs and she's blasting fall out boy. I think this is the beginning of a great friendship
just spent $12 on the claw machine at work and got nothing
work is so hot but Natasha came thru with bahama bucks so that's cool I guess
I have time for a 20 minute nap!!!
I always follow that rule about not going after friends exes but ugh whiteboy so fine
Rob Lowe listening to slayer doing lines on sex tape is so cool
one of my managers is friends with me on snapchat and I always forget 😁
forgot I wasn't wearing shorts under my dress so all of mesa got to see my butt while I was putting air in my tire, y'all welcome
how long can it take this grown ass man to put air in his tires?
I had so much fun last night :,)

my aunt gave me one of her puppies yesterday and I was supposed to bring it home next week but she gave them all away this morning.so tight
I wish I could just forget about all the stupid things I did last night
why am I so hungover........
making out with random girls in the bathroom is probably my favorite thing
I am braless out in public cause my bra wire was stabbing me and this is weird :/
last night Aaron showed me Ashanti's foolish video cause I'm pretty obsessed with Terrence Howard. Can't believe I've never seen it
this is going to turn out worse than when have heart broke up. My tumblr is already a mess
Denise spent almost 20 minutes on the phone trying to talk me into making a plenty of fish account
people who always feel the need to bring up something that doesn't even matter anymore are the worst.
also I got dragged in to spending all day which Denise which I don't mind as long as I do something
can't wait to be at the beach next week, I'm so ready
I woke up so hungry so after my stupid work out I'm gonna stuff myself with tacos.
I want pan dulce
my family is a joke 😒
still sleepy
I'm soooo tired
I've been too high and honestly thought that rotting breaking up was a joke but I guess it's real.. wow
just found out what truffle butter means 😔
I don't know what I wanna do today
my hair is so intense lately and I love it
I'll guess I'll just fuck myself then
got really high thinking I wasn't going to get another table and then I just got say a 6 top
I love the office
it's 2am and I decided I need Jesus in my life
glad I decided to stay in tonight and watch tv like a loser
the people from teen mom are still stupid
