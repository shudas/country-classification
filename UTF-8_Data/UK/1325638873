The way Gove speaks about the SNP is terrifying and genuinely upsetting. #GetThemGone
Watching ancient post-debate QT so far: Michael Gove is üò∑ Andy Birnam needs to crawl from Ed's bum. Generally a shambles.

Jim Murphy please stop talking to us like we're stupid. "Oh voting SNP makes it awfy confusin, jist gie labour a wee vote." #leadersdebate
Unionist parties making this all sound like referendum #2. Not Nic. #leadersdebate
Please get over it and answer some actual questions #leadersdebate
Oh the unionist parties really do like to go on about the terrifying and all-consuming threat of another referendum #leadersdebate
Bloody hell Aberdeen, that's by far the most applause I've heard after words from labour never mind a tory?!? Deary me. #leadersdebate
"Shamefully using vulnerable people to make a political point" couldn't have put it better myself #leadersdebate
"Scotland doesn't have a unique ideology different from the rest of the UK" WHAT EXCUSE ME WHAT PARDON ME SORRY WHAT #leadersdebate
I'm so sick of Jim trying to make pally with the puir wirkin' class folk by putting on sad eyes and talking about hard times #leadersdebate
I look forward to seeing David Cockburn taken apart piece by piece this evening. #leadersdebate
Oh dear haha he's in danger of losing UKIP's one scottish voter
Who has allowed David Cockburn to speak in public #leadersdebate

Great night @FilmGAlba - finishing up with some tunes from @Skipinnish #FilmG http://t.co/ed9mW6nTNm
Fantastic and powerful work from some talented young people at the #FilmG awards. Tackling some difficult issues very tastefully.

Just like that Luisa chap on #BBC3FreeSpeech just there to say stupid things and deflect attention from the real fuck ups, the politicians.
Can't watch #bbcqt but what I'm getting from Twitter is that Janet SP is doing a fine job of distracting us from the important stuff. üëèüëèüëè
If I hear "let me tell you" one more time... #BattleForNumber10
Unacceptably biased question choice. The q's for Cameron were props. Burley and audience joking around w/ Milliband. #BattleForNumber10

Terrible news about the germanwings flight that has crashed in the Alps. My thoughts go to the victims and their families.

Just to clarify guys I am not the owner of dress or the photo of it! I can't read Arabic (yetüòè) so I didn't realise that was the translation
A long shot but does anyone in/around Glasgow have "The Dress"?? We need one very urgently! Blue and black, naturally. Please share!

Welcome to the WEEK OF GETTING STUFF DONE
Tomorrow I'm opening the smoothie maker and the kale.
I'm not happy about any of this, but I do want to give Louise T a cuddle. How has this terrible program sucked me in so badly #TheJump
Aaaaaand back to real life. #JanuaryRuinsMe
It's so early that I'm tearing up listening to The Killers what is wrong with my body
Alternatively, stay as far away as possible. For your own health. #imgross
I think I'll have to find a bus-mum to look after me on this journey. If anyone's on the Skye bus, please come pat my head and tuck me in.
Pray for the people that have to share a bus with my raggedy self at this time in the morning.
Completely blown away and utterly speechless after tonight's @ccfest gig with @sarahjarosz @odonovanaoife and @SaraWatkins - wow. #girlpower
Fantastic show from Malinky tonight @ccfest - @fionahscotssong 's version of My Son David had a tear in my eye, as did The Wild Geese. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Rewatching season 2 of @OITNB and I don't feel bad about it at all #loveyourselfin2015
I want mint choc ice cream
I think I may be experiencing my first ever food poisoning. Happy New Year.
Finally caught up with @GreysABC and feeling many feelings. #calzona #forever

Mother just asked me, in all seriousness, if me and my 17yo cousin took mushrooms last night. Merry Christmas.
Tragedy in George Sq. Whole area cordoned off, people who witnessed the crash are distraught. Thoughts are with those involved. #Glasgow
Westminster will not work with focus or feeling. They do not understand nor do they wish to.
We are so much stronger when we work together with focus and feeling and, most importantly, understanding.
It's not over, no matter which box you ticked. We need change - don't deny our nation progress to spite the the other half of the country.
The rhetoric surrounding immigration is a ceaseless wonder. #bbcqt
Just be kind to each other.

Young @Jamietiree has just joined Twitter. Follow him and question your morals.
If you put enough vegetables in a pie, does that mean you don't have to have vegetables WITH the pie? These are the questions that haunt me.
I just tried to make a mushroom pie. Realised I had no flour. Used oatcakes. Tastes like joy.
When is a jaiked broccoli too jaiked?
Sevens for the last four letters rounds and I got the last two numbers games. Sign me up, Nick. @C4Countdown  #ComingForThatTeapot
Sad to see the gap widening between Ellen Baker and this new lad on @C4Countdown. Sadder still that I actually care.
Under the fridge?
The end of rainbows?
So where are we expected to find democracy then?

Budgeting for Celtic Connections at 1am is a recipe for sadness, denial and more sadness.

The pulsing hum of the generator now has a friend in the pulsing of the lights. Who needs aurora borealis with this feast for the senses.
Wow, even less breathable air in Lush than usual.

I wish someone was here to sing "The Rolling Hills" to me.
The beauty of the borders is underrated.
I might even post a photo of it because you will be so jealous.
I'm well excited for dinner.
