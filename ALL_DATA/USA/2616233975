this is old
have u ever been so happy u just wanna smile &amp; never stop smiling????  😇
if I knew better, I'd do better
dunno what we were thinking back then but what a transformation 😳 http://t.co/cg4LwL7DT1
can't depend on anyone to be there anymore
lost you, found myself
there's nothing to do tonight and it's the last night of spring break 😏
I try to keep myself from thinking about you, but yet here I am again.
just can't stand that there's nothing I can do about it
can't trust anyone anymore
idek butttt😳 http://t.co/hWbWJbz26O
there's a chance it'll snow this Saturday??? wtf is this?
I trusted you but now your words mean nothing because your actions spoke the truth
you're so confusing
just don't think u realize
but me I see something different in you, something that makes me think otherwise.
after school workouts w/ @tatumcollette15 are always the best 💪🏃
"I think we were meant to be but we did it wrong."
I'm never good enough
#ThrowbackThursday with my all time favorite person ever!!!!!❤️ love you kels☺️ http://t.co/wCfOAJ7OJf
there's an end to everything, it'll happen when it happens
everything is just a big "it's whatever" lately
dunno what to do anymore.
hiiiii ❤️ http://t.co/dsFpZMq0Jh
at night is when I miss you most
no matter how mad I am at you I'll always be here for you to talk to about anything at any time of day
if someone would call me and just talk to me until I fell asleep that'd be great😅
"never make a permanent decision on temporary feelings."
and when I thought everything had changed, it didn't.
"If it's meant to be, it will be."

"Maybe it's hard to forgive, but to trust again is the hardest."
throw back to summer 😪 take me back💞💘 http://t.co/YdEtQ4E7GK
😍😍😍😍
No one has to know
if i treated you the way you treated me, you would hate me
what happened to "forever" ?????
sooo blessed with life and the people in it ❤️❤️
I really do appreciate getting called fat for no apparent reason. 😄
being without you is a lot easier than I thought It would be.
let's get the fire started🔥 @_AnastasiaJewel
God took you out of my life to replace you with someone better ❤️🙏
the real you is not someone I like
was it real or was it all in my head? ...
irrelevant 💁😏
i don't hate you I'm just disappointed you turned into everything you said you'd never be
not talking to you for a couple days made me realize so much
I really hope this isn't the end
great way to ruin my night
didn't know it'd be that easy for you to give up on me
I want to go mudding when I get bigger so I can get mud all over my truck @tatumcollette15
one less problem without you
too many numbers deleted tonight
I keep a lot to myself
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BESTFRIEND 💁😊 @The_Young_Stud
why isn't there new filters for the camera on the update?¿
waiting for a text.. 😌
really starting to believe  @faith_higgins41 doesn't love me anymore 😥😪
where do I fit in the picture?
stasia goes ghetto to a preppy nigga real quick real quick
my throat hurts so bad 😩
99% of the time if you ask me what I'm doing I'm either laying in bed or eating💯
such a good night
why me ??
you make me so happy
lullabies and what not @tatumcollette15
I use sarcastic remarks 99% of the time oops 💁
you drive me nuts
