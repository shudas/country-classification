So I got a job growing medical marijuana for the government.......it's the first real job I've had in years and it's awesome ;)
Atleast I didn't bleed all over the mat today that's a step in the right direction
Wow smooth with the sub
If bendo can keep the control then we got a even fight coming into the fifth
Thatch is gonna be to big for bendo, I don't wanna see him get knocked out
Holloway looked great love watching him fight
I'm not shocked silva took some PEDs coming back from that leg break but it makes mma as a whole look bad since he's been the face of it
It's probably just gonna get me more followers
I find it funny I have a parody account that post only Chinese porn
It's better to be hated for something you are then loved for something your not
It's fucked up how in Kentucky you can go to jail for skipping school that's beyond stupid
Watching documentary's about Americas prison state and the need to get people #LockedUp for almost nothing
Time to watch rumble get out worked by Gus #UFCStockholm
