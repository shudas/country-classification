A couple just sat down in front of me on the bus and starting making out hardcore. This should be a violation of Transit By-Law😣 #OCTranspo
MY LIFE KEEPS GETTING RUINED BY 15 YEAR OLD GIRLS WHERE DO THEY ALL KEEP COMING FROM!!!! 😾😾😾
Studying for exams be like
✈

           🎫🏃🚏🚌
                           ▫💭📄📚
From the 97 Airport onto a jet plane and I'm never coming back
Dear Bradley
Here is one thing
You need to know
I want you to be
My one and only all my life
😘😂😂🎶
Bus breaks down at Fallowfield station 
Closest extra bus is at Hurdman station
....
Guess I'm waiting here for 5 years
❗🚏🕔⏳💤🚌 #OCTranspo
🚙😊
Spotted @livcarter37 twin on OC Transpo express 66 Kanata at Lincoln Fields stn. ~170cm, ponytail with a Winnipeg Jets hat, looks like an LG
I love how both Brittany and Brittani favourited my tweet about the 18 year old girl ruining my life 😂😂😹😂
18 year old girl is ruining my life...
I'm so done with this semester
Done with school
Done with life in general
Done with making the same mistakes where I go
Done with everything
🚑....🏃💔
Only 2 hours after debugging my Node.js application did I realize I wasn't sending any data to the server from the HTML form &gt;.&lt; #winning
When you miss your connecting bus by less than 10 seconds and have to wait 30 mins for the next one 😡😡💨
People on OC Transpo are being super annoying today. 🎧😠🚔
It's one of those days where I have nearly zero tolerance for anything remotely sarcastic or annoying. 😡
Why is the entire population of Barrhaven at Tim Hortons right now? 😩
Just hit the override switch and pretend everything is fine
...until the day the switch breaks and everything falls apart.

🎈

      ...🏃💔❌
Remember me by the left side of the back row on a 170 Fallowfield departing from Barrhaven Centre at 06h31 on a Saturday morning.
Remember me by a sesame seed bagel with extra cream cheese and a large hot chocolate.
Remember me by the last $20 I had in my wallet because I really wasn't worth much more than that.
I guess I did this to myself
Maybe one day I'll mean something 😢💔
#PoutineFestUO ran out of lobster bacon poutine 😔
😍
I wish that things would actually work out for once IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?!
Small town, big problems
Big town, same problems
Can't sleep because I'm severely regretting a major life decision I made 4 years ago and I'm unsure what I should do in the next 8-12 months
So tired of suppressing my expectations
🐒
I signed up for Tinder now where's the option to exclude duckface selfies because that's what &gt;80% of profiles are... #quack
She's a 15 year old girl and she's one of the biggest threats to my sanity.
#goaway
😠👈💥👉😡
🔑💔🔒
Packets keep dropping over TCP so I switch over to UDP, pretty soon I'm get timeout errors and before I know it the IP address changes.
This subnet went from cyclic to linear real quick
I made a mistake 5 years and ~8 months ago. It was my decision, I can't blame someone else.
I haven't gone a day without thinking about it.❄
Cause you’re too sexy, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That’s why (that’s why)
I still get jealous

😉💔◽▫🚗💲▫▫💙▫▫🏃▫🚌
My girlfriend just ditched me and gave zero fucks
Just gonna keep hitting these override switches and maybe I can hang on for a little bit longer.
The thing is, you aren't guaranteed an IP address with dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP).
I hope you're happy now that you are a lot closer to what you want. Thanks for doing whatever it took to get me out of the way.
Two weeks ago...
#tbt to when I had time to do things I enjoy such as working, riding OC Transpo, and hanging out with friends.
This is the third fucking time this has happened so I'm done with it.
🚌🚗🚶
My life is going so well that I broke down and started crying in front of my best friend at a coffee shop at 3am 😢⚠💥
Having severe withdrawal symptoms 😘😭
Bought my friend a #PRESTOcard, it looks nicer than the one I got when they first came out!… https://t.co/XP1DeYiwea
😕
It really bothers me that you hurt, annoy, and/or cause unnecessary stress to my friends.
Way to ruin my night/morning. 😔🔫
.@GitHubEducation How long does it take to get approved for the student pack? Have been waiting for 3 weeks now
One day I'll drive off a cliff but until then just put another piece of tape onto the check engine light.
⚠🚗▫▫▫😢
From the night that we met
I knew that you're way out of my league
Now you've found one of my greatest weaknesses
And here we go again
It's been a month since I've last seen you and I don't know if I ever will again :-(
Security vulnerabilities are
hard to fix in software, but
impossible to fix in humanity

❌⛔🚫.....🏃.....😍✅💘
Two people puked on my bus and there's no extras at the moment so my driver is told to finish the trip #OCTranspo
😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾
I hate everything sometimes.
Newtons third law can be such a bitch sometimes. ➡💥⬅
#OCTranspo route 170 was fun but it stopped at a red light under the railroad xing barrier very close to the tracks. Trip at 06h31(bus 5060)
Tonight I reached a new high in my life. 😘❤
I crashed rather quickly afterwards as well. 😾💔
Pain travels through the human body at ~380 km/h.
My bus doesn't go that fast.
Maybe that's why running away from my problems isn't working.
Encapsulation is a double edged sword. 🙊
But then again, so is transparency. 🙉
Sometimes there is just no winning. 🙈
😻
Code 4 emergency in progress.
Drawbacks of living in the city: "Danger Falling snow and ice" everywhere
Just had three @OC_Transpo fare inspectors get on my 96 bus for three stops but unfortunately they didn't inspect anyone 😞🚌💲😞
Please excuse me while I go batshit insane for the next two months.
Going to lose my mind pretty soon… am I ever going to see you again?
Note to self: Buy Greyhound tickets well in advance of travel date. Not only are they super expensive, there are no seats available.
The driver of the "In Training" #OCTranspo bus in front of mine is probably very nervous on these road conditions #canyouspeedupalittle?
Roads and Traffic Service is on top of their game tonight on the Transitway for once

❄❄❄🚜 ⚠🚌❄❄❄❄🚜
Haven't been this happy in a while but boy am I ever tired 😉😴🚌
Broke my record for longest hug tonight 😀
As I sit here in this empty coffee shop at the end of the Transitway, I wonder if I mean anything to you.
By special occasion I mean an OC Transpo fare inspection. Pretty sad that I only get 3-4 a year considering the amount of buses I ride 🚌💲🏃💨
I buy and eat these gourmet cookies upon these special occasions that happen about 3-4 times every calendar year.
When you're having a bad day and it gets worse because your friend had a terrible day &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 😿
If there are special constables watching the cameras at the transit stations, hope you enjoyed my awkward dance moves. 😂😂🏃💃😹
I don't think the fire extinguisher is supposed to catch on fire #whatisthis 🔥🚒
This was a great waste of an hour and a half 😡🕑
I love how uOttawa contracts its snow removal services to work at 5 am on a Sunday morning.
I just realized that today is not Sunday!!! The mall is still open!
When you arrive at your destination but your toes haven't warmed up yet #nwoproblems
Might as well head home and do some assignments for school or remote work because I've spent enough time at Tim Hortons #smalltownproblems
I'm missing out on the #Transitway snow removal operations in Ottawa right now #detour #snowplows #backupalarms #bluelights ❄❄🚜⛄
Pulling over every so often to play Trivia Crack because driving around alone isn't all that exciting #smalltownproblems
When you're trying to submit an assignment at 3:30 AM on Blackboard and the attach files button isn't working #uOttawaProblems
Why do all the exciting things happen when I'm out of the city?
Apparently there's an incident going on between Tunney's Pasture and Bayview stn. Transitway is closed.
So I'm kinda short $2.10 for my pizza…
It's -45 outside with the wind chill factor... I love cold weather but I'm just not feeling it today 😨❄
😊❤
Too cold to walk to the dogs game and there's no public transit here #smalltownproblems
Normally I have higher tolerance of cold weather than most other people but today feels much colder than -23 or whatever  ❄💔
uOttawa food services provide really flimsy utensils and I just broke 3 forks while eating the food from their cafeteria.
Removing a rock from your shoe that requires untying is more difficult than expected when standing on a crowded bus.
My bus ran 3 minutes late
I was running 3 minutes and 4 seconds late 
I missed my bus by 4 seconds

      🚌▫▪◽◾🏃💨
Your sister sounds like a bitch #Instagram #Barrhaven #Baseline #grade9problems
Just saw five #Quebec drivers use the #Transitway. Some things never change. Remind me again why they're allowed in other provinces😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🚌🚔
Just bought a homeless guy a McDouble because I haven't done so in a while. Hoping that this weekend will get better for both him and I 🍔😺
Just had an @OC_Transpo bus leak hot radiator fluid all over me and quite a few passengers....at least it was close to the garage
Waiting for the 5 Billings Bridge be like:

…27 years later…
