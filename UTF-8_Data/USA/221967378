Everyone is jealous of scott, Julian, and jroc being in Cancun. Imagine how I feel. That's my team!!!!
I mouth wash and floss my teeth like five times a day. #Habit
Cancun sure sounds nice today... 💭🌴
Good thing I didn't pack up my cold weather pants quite yet.
With all due respect to my fitness competition friends, I'd rather do an even like tough mudder over a fitness show.
Scott is easily the worst in the TRAP at social media.
Haha its so funny tho. https://t.co/rmCEqfpXkL
💯💯💯😂😂😂 http://t.co/aPbI1nhUYN
Today was alright. I did find 20 bucks in the ground tho 😊
With two of my roommates on vacation and deven at work you best believe I've been walking around the Trap naked!  #NoPantsZone
The sun drains my body. But would much rather feel drained than frozen.
How do I still not have where the emojis are located,  memorized.
Getting blasted tomorrow. #excited
Good luck to @miriahpaige at work today. Getting tazed. NOT level 1,000 jealous. #MyGFisABadass
Wanna wish a safe vacation to my boys @JRickyRoc @the_real_julian @sdiesel13 have fun! Level 1000 jealous.
Last summer was rough as fuck for me at work because it was my first summer alone. I'm feeling really optimistic about this summer.
Never been the type to jump from job to job, relationship to relationship, or always have new friends. Loyalty is one of my best traits.
"@Deeskiie_: We really got put on "blast" on page with 5 likes lol"and scott was one of the likes 😂😂😂
Everyone makes mistakes in life, just avoid the big ones and take care of the little ones asap and life is so much easier.
💯💯💯 http://t.co/qhVVJiDptB
Plus the picture they chose of us is 🔥🔥🔥
Whoever put us on  "blast" is an idiot. They pretty much said 1 we don't live with our parents, 2 that means we get money &amp; 3 we get bitches
My workout partners progression. Proud of him. http://t.co/nUWyWCZVV4
"@lexy9490: It would be @FLEX_IS_FRESH"#cityboy good seeing you
"@miriahpaige: Let me find out @FLEX_IS_FRESH  put an emoji next to his name. 😂 #babe #makingexecutivedecisions http://t.co/kR34gMzGuw"😈

"@alejando_nflo: @FLEX_IS_FRESH #fired 😂😂😂😂"did not get fired I'll have you know lol
Not looking forward to going to work today. 😦
Opening day will get ya hahaha http://t.co/3Uo2hEzPA6
Shout out to me saying fuck working at the club last night. My boss hit me up . "What's your eta" ughhhh is wasted an appropriate response?
Shout out to having a workout partner who didn't go out yesterday and is already hitting me up to go to the gym.  #motivation #ABG
Shout out to my ex girlfriends mom coming up to say hi while I got thrown out 😂😂😂 fuckkkk. #OpeningDay
Shout out to getting kicked out of Viewhouse twice.
Soooo did the Rockies win?
I ain't gonna lie I love being drunk,I love my team and today is going to be on and cracking. Leggo! #OpeningDay
Honestly couldn't tell you if the Rockies won the last two opening days. Don't plan on giving two shits  if they win this year
Do you have to wear a shirt in Viewhouse? #RatchetProbs
I have work tonignt at at the club. This nigga should know that I'm going in wasted!!!!!! His fault for not giving me the night off.
Make sure you eat fuckers
I'm 💯% in the mood to turn up🔃and die💀! #OpeningDay #Denver ⚾🍺🍻
Even though it's only April so far 2k15 had been really good to me. Only going to get even better from here!⬆⬆⬆
Two customers with dope BMW'S requested me today. Can two less stressful customers request me Monday lol
I need this BMW I'm working on!
Go out of your way to make someone's day today.
Of course the guy with the 2014 BMW requests me. Lol
Time to focus. http://t.co/oSsC1ACPg9
Last year on opening day. I think I might tie a balloon around one of my belt loops this year so I don't get lost.🎈 http://t.co/o4hT3HVHtF
My gf has two options when I'm being a grump and she's not around. Send me a funny picture or send me a nude. I prefer the second option.
http://t.co/jJeDAxf9YA
Oooh my work partner broke 2 windshields today setting them in the car. That's what he gets for being cocky.
"@GrownAssMidget: When your barber finds out you were seeing someone else  http://t.co/Tz3N4VyVG3"@AkDaddyYaBish
People that ONLY want a dealership windshield are idiots. If a rock hits it it's still going to crack like an aftermarket windshield. 🐸☕
When I play sports it's my escape from everything. I'm not thinking about bills, work, any personal issues I'm free from all the bullshit.
I hate my workout partners girlfriend.
To my alcoholic friends and I opening day is like Christmas. Let us enjoy the day!⚾🍺🍻
How the hell did I got to bed at 8 and still feel drained today? 20oz red Bull I'm coming for you
Haha gomez wanted none of that. Walked straight to the dugout.
You know I had a long day at work if I'm missing chest day. 😴
My face when @miriahpaige introduced me to her grandpa and didn't warn me that he was a 6'3 black man. http://t.co/2C87RxkxN9
My mom is tripping with all this baby talk. 
I can't even dress myself half the time.😯
You ever go to take a picture and it's on selfie mode and you look at yourself like wtf do I look like this 😢😯😞😟
Tired as fuck.
😐🔫
Some days I feel like quitting my job then I remember I AIN'T NO BITCH!
On the job solo training has to be the toughest way to learn but is the most beneficial because you have to figure it out yourself.
My team &gt;
It would suck to be one of those people who has no one to go out with. Any weekend I have at least 30 ppl I can hit up to go party with.
Let's go Broncos!!!
Shit, it's not football season yet.
The only thing keeping me from quitting today is that it's nice out today.
I hate it when the cashier says "enter your pin" before it let's you enter it. 😡
Why do I have to have allergies 😧😥🌾🍃🌺🌻
Just know that most things in life are easier said than done.
"@miriahpaige: @FLEX_IS_FRESH I hate you 😒👊"😂😂😂😘
"@miriahpaige: Yesterday I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't even take one picture. 😕 dang. At least I looked like an Easter egg"
You would think we lived in Africa with all the snakes in Denver🐍🐍🐍
Idk  how guys or girls can care less if their girlfriend or boyfriends family doesn't like them. That should be important.
Never get too comfortable. #rulesoflife
I'm the worst at going to the doctor. #Stubborn
59 degrees rather cloudy and warmer. 25 percent chance of rain for Friday. 
Not the best weather but could be wayyyyy worse. #NotMadAboutIt
I have to be the worst at watching movies
Four day work week because I'm off for opening day! 🍻⚾
RT if you've passed out  at the TRAP 🏠 http://t.co/bRM33h0lez
I feel like everyone always thinks ill be that dad who forces his kid to play sports, but nah he don't wanna play that's his choice not mine
Out football is dope af,  you drop a pass you get pulled immediately, no questions asked.
Had to show @Eddie_Franco81what a real team looks like today. #HuskersUp
Miss @miriahpaige 😚
Denver most turnt bar. #waitonit
Might Happen Sooner Than later.
These trick niggas  give your boy some suspenders and let me start slinging drinks at the back bar with Scott and have J barback that shit
I'll never stop playing sports.
I just wanna be done with my shift, go to sleep, wake up and play ball. 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
#HuskerGang
Miriah doesn't like that I'm cutting, she wants me all fat so no girls will like me.
"@Deeskiie_: @FLEX_IS_FRESH on the weekends you got me 😊😊😊🐺🐺" I'll teach you how to install now and we can be Blackout Boyz Auto Glass 😂😂😂
Back to being a one man wolf  pack
As much as my work partner annoyed me I'm happy for him that he completed training and is on his own starting Monday.
"@daddyLAC: @FLEX_IS_FRESH having kids&gt; not having kids" your kids are dope tho. Mine will probably be little monsters 🙈🙈🙈
I need to knock on wood real fucking quick being all cocky  about not having kids and shit
Just realized I'll be in Vegas for father's day... good thing your boy ain't got no kids!!!!
People that smoke cigarettes in their car are disgusting!
"@LearnSomethlng: This is what a male red kangaroo looks like. http://t.co/tXBr9K2tYr" ABG as an animal
I'm very good, at being very consistent, this diet shit shouldn't be too difficult.
Some people buy expensive cars but don't have the money to maintain them and after about a year their dash is lit up like a Christmas tree.
I just want to get all shredded for the summer if that means I have to stick to a gay ass diet for a couple months, fuckkkkk it.
Never been on a diet before let's see how this goes.
Starting the day off with a thousand dollar install. If you own a Benz  better have the money to fix it. http://t.co/HLlZY3sn1S
These dogs must be in heat looking for bitches or something. Lost but now found. http://t.co/t6n03r7Xy7
