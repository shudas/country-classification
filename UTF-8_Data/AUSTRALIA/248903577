I'm still betting that the amount of gold for a token will go up considerably, as there will be more people with gold to spend than tokens.
hmmm... 30k gold for AU$25? Not enough gold for me to drop the cash. Curious to see how the price fluctuates!
Not long left to vote for the final 4 now! http://t.co/p53ctZ0shx CHOOSE! CHOOSE THE FORM OF THE DESTRUCTOR
