May 5th can't come soon enough.
The $26B NW Upgrader is more of a scandal than the Ontario gas plants. @GlobalCalgary @CTVCalgary, @CBCCalgary  where are you? #abvote
Sounds like a PC candidate may have had an 'Eve Adams' moment in Marda Loop last night. https://t.co/7j9K1eNNqz #abvote
Ray Jones appears to be quite the election grinch. #yyccc #abvote http://t.co/U4ByVaQCsH
My biggest pet peeve: when there's an election and the media spends a whole 30 seconds on it in their newscast. #abvote
Looks like the #wrp are on their way to a full slate. 76/87.  Have until Friday. http://t.co/uHmIBjozfQ source: @davecournoyer #abvote
Volunteers are the lifeblood of any campaign. Reminds me of this post I did on doorknocking in 2013. http://t.co/WJMmxwNxDe #abvote
Phone's screen cracked while out today. I was going through social media withdrawal. Sadly expensive to get it fixed.
Seems like quite a few PC MLA's are relying on the "Prentice" brand to get them elected. Hope their eggs aren't all in one basket. #abvote
This is unfortunate, @AlbertaParty. Would have been good to let her run. Still time to reverse the decision! http://t.co/QNQC0F48La #abvote
Gah twitter politics is too soon. I'll stick to door knocking for a few more weeks. Much more effective early on.
This Uber Facebook recruiting ad could potentially stir up a storm at council... #yyccc #yyc http://t.co/AX2SMC69Dc
Quite a few snippy comments on the #abvote feed today. There must be an election happening ;) #ableg
Watching WCW Uncensored 95 on the WWE Network app. Who knew a King of the Road match even existed.

#abvote drinking game; each time someone tweets that they got a great/good/superb/amazing response at the doors, drink. #ableg
Does it ever boggle anyone else's mind on why the PC's still have folks who support them? #ableg
Oh @BMO. You increasing your banking fees is why I don't keep my primary chequing with you.
Big tree blown down in Westgate. Feel bad for the three vehicles it landed on. View from my balcony. #windy #yyc http://t.co/nZ5wVNebYK
Hi @TerriBeaupre1. Do you hire a private investigator to vet all candidates? Guessing not considering Mike Allen. #ableg
This is shady (yet not surprising) . #pcaa hires private investigator to vet Lall. http://t.co/4AbXi6knIr #ableg #wrp
If Fox loses his nomination, it'll be a day of vindication for #wrp supporters who have dumped time and money into the party. #ableg #wrp
Less messy exit strategy for Danielle would have been to step down as #wrp leader and run federally. But what do I know about strategy. :P
Hey @jamieLaLL, a trend is occurring. Gary, Danielle. Maybe Bruce is next!
Gary Bikman loses his nomination. #ableg #wrp
Great to see @JWinslowYEG at the Wildrose Leader announcement tonight. Was digging the tin foil cowboy hat.
On the lighter side, Danielle Smith and Karma walk into a bar. Karma says, "Hi Danielle. Nice to meet you." #ableg
Thanks to @MLA_Danielle for her service and the good she brought Wildrose in the beginning. Mistakes were made at the end, but all the best.
Got chased by a dog while out doorknocking. Mistakenly thought I was with the PC's. #ableg
After yesterday's budget, bet Preston is pissed that he got double crossed. #ableg #wrp #yyc @manningcentre
Highwood nomination on the same day as the #wrp leadership vote, they said. It will be a good idea, they said :P http://t.co/DkmNpDlPEu
On the lighter side, joke is on the liquor stores.  Their weekend flyers came out before the budget announcement. Cost as advertised #ableg
So pretty much, Jim Prentice has taken the PC party to the fiscal left of Redford. Is this what you signed up for @MLA_Danielle? #ableg
ANNNNDDDD DEAD. There goes the Alberta Advantage, courtesy of your ever so wasteful PC gov't. #ableg #cndpoli
Watching three, now dead, pro wrestlers on WWE Network. Yokozuna vs Lex Lugar w/ Mr. Perfect as referee. Damn wrestlers have short lives.
Zero mentioned tonight by Jim Prentice and the culture of entitlement in the PC Party.  How will he end that? #ableg #yyc
This is like the most epic fail of a rebuttal I've ever seen. #ableg
What? David? Vaccinations aren't really an election issue.... #ableg
That fine china will get you 25% of the way to South Africa. #ableg #yyc
How much more of an entitlement case needs to be made? And this is new mgmt? PC's spend close to $10k on fine china for Jim's office. #yyc
If you ever want a laugh, and to see "Harper Derangement Syndrome" up close and personal, check out the nutbars that reply to PM's tweets.
Anyone else looking forward to JP's Redford moment of TV on Tuesday? #ableg
You've got to be kidding me. Randy Thorsteinson is actually gonna run a full slate?Is Rob Anders running in west? :p http://t.co/E0mR9nJKbk
Here's one of those "under the dome syndrome" things Paul Hinman talked about. http://t.co/Wh7OgXahmW Rebuttal it, dammit. #ableg #wrp
&amp;$#@@!!)!!(!. Opportunity wasted. http://t.co/Wh7OgXahmW. Rebuttal the damn thing. #wrp
