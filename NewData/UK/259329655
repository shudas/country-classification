Great mystery of #GE2015 so far - who is Stirling McNeillie, what do his Children of the Atom party stand for (&amp; why choose Shrewsbury)?
Picked up @realTheVeryBest's Makes A King from @PiccadillyRecs y'day. Unquestionably album OTY so far. Mature, majestic Malawian sounds.
Russian ships en-route to N. Atlantic for exercises, not drilling in the Channel itself. #Maskirovka

Great #ParisRoubaix preview, but I'm worried that Florian Senechal may need to take out a restraining order against @Cyclingbetting...

ParISS-Roubaix, or ParEE-Roubaix? I'm settling on the former.

(N.B. alway "Roo-bay", not "Roo-bakes")
I agree. https://t.co/InVr6OkffO
Ha! Enormo-lol at the, er, 'ambitiously priced' Star Wars collection on downloadz. 59 quid! I'd pay half that, maybe.
