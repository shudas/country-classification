Let me be the one to saYve you
What is with society and its obsession with making ppl and things popular/famous
I hate how youtube and everything I loved for its indifference is now mainstream and famous.. Why does life take everything away from me?
Kinda sad isn't it .. @5SOS  fame..
So uhh .. Ur famous now @Luke5SOS @Ashton5SOS @Michael5SOS @Calum5SOS
Umm y aren't you coming to Sydney ? @tyleroakley 😒😒😒😔😔
Isn't it funny how you know EXACTLY how to always say the WRONG thing 😄
I wanna say "rant over" but idk I could say much more about these saddos who r obsessed with quantity of friends not quality, I pity u 😝😢
But seriously who wants to hang out with someone who's not even focused at the time cos they're making plans with others 24/7 😂😂😂😂😒😒
I know a few... Hope you open ur eyes 😳 and stop before it's too late... For you tho it kinda already is
If anything it means u have no real friends cos u can't dedicate more than 1 day with them Cos u have plans with other ppl that night 😂
I find it REALLY sad when ppl feel the need to always be doing something with ppl like WHAT R U TRYING TO PROVE? 😂 so sad
Seriously surreal to final meet one of the ppl who helped me for years without knowing it 😌😌❤️so proud @ConnorFranta http://t.co/5zH5WYUQVC
Literally the SWEETEST in person ❤️❤️ not like I didnt know tht before 😏💞💞@shanigrimmond complement on me 💋💄😱 THANKS😶 http://t.co/ZpTjBHpfor
Looks awkward haha but it really wasn't ❤️❤️❤️ @AndreaRussett http://t.co/rXxZcMOhcc
😂😂😂 my new profile pic of me and @troyesivan  making the most amazing eye contact at #AmplifyLIVE SYDNEY ❤️❤️ he completed my 💋💄💄
I wish youtubers were within reach, went to #AmplifyLIVE &amp; ughh I just want to be friends with them, they get me but will never remember me
❤️Thanks for making my day whenever I feel like shit Trish, your car vlogs are my fave ❤️😌😔😌 @trishapaytas
Heartache .... It's actually very literal
So far the @justinbieber roast is pretty toasty oooooo 🍗🍞
Oh man.. The feel are really setting in now #AlwaysInOurHeartsZaynMalik #RIP1D
Ya no I'm depressed if I'm on twitta 😄
Only know you've been high when you're feelin low... Oath
Can't wait to get on the Nozawaonsen slopes !! 😁😁😁❤️👌🏂🎿
Myoko kogen was stunning and the best first experience skiing I could ever have wished for!!! 👘🎿🏂😜❤️
It sucks don't it.. I thought I was the lucky one ..
It's actually sad how much I want to be in the presence of luke Hemmings rn
UGHHH ANYTHING THAT ISNT FROM MY MUMS GENERATION IS BAD AND LIFE DESTROYING ISNT IT !😡😡😡😡🔫😄😷
I'm actually so fucking sick of my mum complaining about technology and how people aren't really living when she knows nothing about it.
Mum- "what are you doing?" 
Me- "on Twitter" 
Mum- "oh who are you tweeting?" 😂😂😂😂😂 hahaha dying
Don't you just love when all of your friends are out together for the 3rd fucking time and inviting you doesn't even cross their mind??😄
Memorable night @ the 1975 concert made a new friend, BBf on tha left @kathleen_davies ❤️ http://t.co/CfOY8KEE2J
Happy straya day ! ⚪️🔴🔵♥️how are you spending the day?
utube is sad in the sense that ppl say they love or hate you and pretend to know u even tho they really never will.... @velvetgh0st
i have calmed down… rant over.
you would actually find that the more negativity you point out and spread THE MORE NEGATIVITY YOU RECEIVE
IM usually sympathetic but alfie just blocked comments on his gaming video and i mean REALLY? just so done .
.. hate comments, means that everyone is hating… it is such a tiny minority, WHY CANT THEY SEE THAT?
i UNDERSTAND the reasoning (if u have an enormous fan base like Felix) but it is not acceptable for small you tubers to think that a few..
Y SHOULD I SUPPORT THESE YOUTUBERS IF THEY DONT EVEN GIVE US A VOICE? we just sit and give them fame and money and they block us out?
I AM SO DONE WITH YOUTUBERS THINKING THEYRE ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY AND DISABLING COMMENTS #stopdisablingthecomments It completely puts me off

This year has seen too many artists diss and put down other artists, support one another, it's not hard and it's just childish not to!
It's literally bullying to the next level, what a role model @IGGYAZALEA 😒😒😒
Does he think it's funny? It's not. it's racist, sexist and just plain wrong wow do I think different of him now... @IGGYAZALEA 😡😡😡😒😒
I just don't get it, what kinda bored, low life spends there time insulting and threatening a fellow rapper ughh I'm so mad @IGGYAZALEA
So @5SOS are home and the wearer has gone from 35+ degrees to utter shit ☔️❄️⚡️🌊
Is nash creepin again ?? @Nashgrier
I love when @5SOS come home, it's so dumb but it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy  ❤️❤️😌😊😊😊😊💘
I know@its your last concert with 1D but you're COMING HOME 😍😍 @5SOS
Does crying really work? Like does it help? Does it change anything? Cos it's been a few years now.
Y is it never good thought huh? Y can't I be self conceded and love everything and everyone in life ?
I hate being left alone with my brain to think about how small and insignificant I am and all the bad shit in my life ... Never good ..
Sorry for the morbid tweets to whoever actually gives a crap, just feeling ... 😷😣😔 uninspired and like an ant that's going nowhere
I'm a nobody, yep that's how to word it 😒
I wanna go camping.... I need a kangaroo hug rn 😔
Y do I get so shocked when I see youtubers on TV?? I need to get used to that
Just saw an actual add for spud on TV @troyesivan  wooooooow  this is awesome ❤️❤️❤️😳
