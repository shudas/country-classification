So I don't get how ZRP is going to protect Zimbos in S.A. Do yall have jurisdiction. I think not 👀

1yr ago young girls were STOLEN!  Families broken and a nation robbed of potential. Prayers&amp;Love #BringBackOurGirls http://t.co/icewfuQiLm
In fact what are #AfricanHeadsofStates and the rest of Africa doing about all this violence? #Nigeria #Kenya #SouthAfrica #PanAfrica #1love
What is the #AfricanUnion and especially #SADC doing about #XenophobicSA ?
Lord grant us Peace. 🙏
Being uneducated is South Africa's biggest problem in terms of these #xenophobicattacks and #XenophobicSA
I don't get why South Africans feel hella special.  I honestly don't get it 😒
You all represent one nation.  So until you start standing up against what's wrong.  I for one will use the same brush to paint your story.
Eh no one to tell me it's just "black" South Africa. Aren't yall one nation?  Then you wonder why #Xenophobia
South Africa I am very ashamed of you right now! My heart bleeds💔...oh my Africa 😭😭😭  #XenophobiaMustFall
It's okay to show your emotions. You don't have to be "strong" all the time

Bitches finna tryna get clapped.  How about finding a different obession that's not my boyfriend.  Y'all ain't even friends. BOMBOCLAT! 😒
midnight Skype calls from my big bro, just to tell me he loves me and is proud of me 😭😭. Definitely needed that! #motivated #lastpush 💪
#moreLovelessHate
the issue is the problem not the individual.
the problem is, when people have different opinions, they end up attacking the individual, and NOT ADDRESSING the issue
Results haven't even been out for 24 hours and the masks have already fallen. 😲😩.

Some people are so inconsiderate.  Like how can one turn down the heat so damn low. 😡
You can do anything you want, and it doesn’t have to involve being rubbed up on by a bunch of drunk strangers.
Get delivery. Watch movies. Do karaoke. Play laser tag, for goodness sake.
The beauty of adulthood in your 20s is that you’re still young enough to be in touch with your most fun, yet totally innocent self.
In the meantime,  I'm going to be praying for the Lord to heal you from all the hurt you are feeling spiritually, and otherwise.  #Godheals
It's high time you started taking responsibility of your life and actions.  You're too grown for excuses 😑
If you don't believe in the Lord, there are trained professionals that you can see. You really need to sort your stuff out.
Jokes aside,  take your problems to the Lord in prayer,  he is the only one that can give you the closure you're looking for😊
You laid your bed now lay in it!  Stop disturbing everyone's peace 😧
Texting my boyfriend trying to get him to feel sorry you. Newsflash he doesn't give a fuck. You're going to be the sorry 1 when I cut you 😩
What better way to end a self pampering day than a long bath and big ass glass of wine😏.And I ain't even single #selflove u can't beat that💕
9. That's the kind of love i deserve. Happy Valentine's Day people
8. I want to know that you're praying for our family as the leader. I want to know that you will grace my imperfect self.
7.I want to know that you won't be staring at other women lustfully. I want to know that you will raise our children to be gifts of God
6. Keep your flowers, I want true, unconditional love. I want to know that when it gets hard, you won't leave.
5. It works through problems. It loves the unlovable. It's unconditional. It gives 100% even if even when your spouse gives 0%
4.The love of Jesus is patient. It's kind. It doesn't record wrong doings, it always believes the best. It doesn't quit.
3. it's all in "I ain't cooking him dinner cuz he ain't do this. Or she's nagging me so I ain't coming home.
2. If you don't, my performance will be based on the way you treat me. It's all based in selfishness
I've learned that culture depicts love as flowers/gifts.But cultures idea of love is wrong.It's conditional.it's if you go 50%,I will go 50%
So I hardly ever drink #energydrinks but for some odd reason I did today.I feel like I'm going to die, my heart's racing my head is aching 😭
I could never date a skinny guy #nope 🙅
I am in such a happy place in my life. God is the ultimate source of my contentment.  #happiness #GodIsGoodAllTheTime

Yall are steady making jokes about how a 90 year old man fell #MugabeFalls . What if it was your grandpa? 😏
Praying for a speedy recovery.  Never have I ever experienced such a fever in my life 😷😖 #PrayForChido #HealingRain
4.  We learn to value others with that love which can only expand them and then... they do the same for us. Reciprocity
3.When we believe we are worthy of love so do others and then our lives change.
2. But you also have to decide if you are ready to be the kind of woman that believes she is worthy of love.
1.Your man has to decide on what kind of man he wants to be and then you can decide if he's the kind of man you want to build with..
We often believe that when someone says they love us...they know HOW to love us. Everybody needs a minute to learn...Sometimes a lifetime.

Have you ever stopped to think how you make me feel?  #foodforthought
If our friendship is centered around how I make you feel. Then maybe you should invest in a diary or a pet and share your feelings with it.😑
Yea definitely haven't talked about #laccoliths and #batholiths for about 6 years. Damn
