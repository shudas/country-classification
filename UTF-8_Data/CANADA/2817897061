Think I'm going for a bus ride tonight and check out Chapter's on Whyte Ave. Perfect walking around weather.
Been awake for almost 19 hours and I've just about had it. Gotta get some rest before @YoungDrunkPunk on @City_tv  tonight.
Sitting at the mall, by myself, as usual. #Lame

People are scum! Someone took my snack out of the fridge at work. I have extra but that's besides the point.
My good deed for the day: I helped a new and confused bus driver figure out which way to go since I take that route almost everyday.
I called in sick to work tonight and got a little snarky with my supervisor. Feeling kind of guilty now. Oh well, I'll apologize tomorrow.
Who cuts a pie like this? My brother, that's who! #weirdo http://t.co/o5PdAoEZ3t
2 weeks from tonight I'll be seeing @DefLeppard live for the first time. #CantWait #GoingOutForOnce
Is it just me or is it bad form to favourite your own tweets?
I should go for a walk today, but I probably won't. #NobodyToGoWith
Just saw @YoungDrunkPunk and it was great as usual. One small bone to pick: another jab at Edmonton? What did we ever do to you? 😡😢😉😄
In 6 weeks I get to be in the general vicinity of @DaveSFoley @BrucioMcCulloch @ScottThompson_ @Mark_DMcKinney and #KevinMcDonald !! 😍
I hope the weather starts to warm up soon. Getting sick and tired of wearing my winter coat. #SpringHasSprung #IThink
Okay. You people who keep following me on here trying to get me to buy followers. Knock it off! I may be unpopular but I'm not desperate!
Tempted to order something from Amazon but I'm not sure what. I don't think my credit card can take the strain so maybe I shouldn't. #bored
Watching @nbcsvu from last week and does it ever have me riled up! (In a good way) such a good episode! 😊
Edmonton weather: In the space of 2 hours it went from 😎 and +20 to ☔️ windy and +9. Going to ❄️ tomorrow. 😔
A rep from my life insurance company is coming over today. I wouldn't care if they showed up on time and didn't take forever to leave.
What the fuck is this meerkat thing people are talking about? #confused #notintheloop
I've loved #KidsInTheHall for years and I still can't quote lines verbatim like most people can. It's definitely an admirable trait! 😍
There's an employee at my job with the unfortunate name of Fairy. 😳
I'm glad that @YoungDrunkPunk is back on @City_tv tomorrow! My favourite show to watch on Wednesday! 😊 #HumpDay
I wonder if the #KITH would notice if I stowed away on their bus when they go on tour? Sorry, it's 5:30 in the morning and I'm loopy. 😜
The support manager at work asked me if I would be 100% finished at 7 A.M.  and I said "darn tootin"  😳  Who says that?! #weirdo
There was none of this 2 days ago. Very tough to walk in. http://t.co/3CTsTnqoEr
My partner in crime at work isn't here tonight but I don't mind. I like working by myself sometimes. More room to maneuver. #Solo
Would someone kindly explain why some people's tweets are protected? I'm sure the answer is obvious, but this honestly confuses me. 😕
Hurry up 7 A.M.! I'm in desperate need of a nap. 😴😴😴😴😴
I can't freaking wait to see @Mark_DMcKinney @DaveSFoley @ScottThompson_ and @BrucioMcCulloch in May!! #IPromiseToShutUpNow #Ecstatic 😻
It's not even the end of March and I already have plans for New Year's Eve. My nephew's wedding! #YesImOld
Got my tickets!!! See you May 19th! @DaveSFoley @BrucioMcCulloch @Mark_DMcKinney @ScottThompson_ @KITHOnline @TheRealTavie #HappyAsHell 😊
Got to Ticketmaster an hour early for my #KITH tix and they sent me away. LOL! I'm at the mall killing time. I guess I'm a little overeager!
In less than 5 hours I will hopefully have my #KITH tickets in my hand. I'll keep you posted! (Whether you care or not) 😄
I have red,watery and puffy eyes from my friend's very cute cat. I'm going to take a wild guess and say I'm allergic. 😢
Thrilled to death that @KITHOnline are coming to Edmonton! No meet and greet for me but as long as I can see the show it's all good! ☺️
Saw my brother for the first time in a couple of years. Wish I had the time to stop and talk. At least I know he's alive.
I've got 6 nieces and nephews and an adorable great nephew as well. That's more than enough for me! #TweetingForTheSakeOfIt #childless
