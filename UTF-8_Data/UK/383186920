Brilliant reception for @VoteDrewHendry while canvassing today. Thanks to all @InvernessSNP members and others helping #SNPGain #GE15
Douglas Alexander referred to Miliband as "the present leader" @bbcqt. Does he suggest he won't be for much longer by this referral??
#leadersdebate Willie Rennie cannot state a policy LibDems they would not be prepared to compromise on. Clear? No, thought not. #VoteSNP
#leadersdebate Jim Murphy needs to get a grip on reality. Meantime it's a rammy.
#leadersdebate @NicolaSturgeon makes the valid point: Scotland's prosperity is not, and should not, be dependent on oil. Vision = #VoteSNP
#leadersdebate Why does Scotland have no oil fund? Ask Westminster Labour &amp; Tory governments, both are culpable. #VoteSNP
It's very simple if enough Labour and @theSNP MP's vote against a Tory queens speech there can be no Tory Government. #ScotDebates  #voteSNP
#ScotDebates Under @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP are investing billions in Scottish education, new Colleges and Schools being built right now.
Why is Willie Rennie on #ScotDebates???? He should be on "Pointless" üòÄüòÉüòÅ #voteSNP #GE15
#ScotDebates Jim Murphy cannot or will not answer @NicolaSturgeon on the scale of Labour's proposed cuts. Why? It's time to #votesnp #GE15
12,000,000 of the deficit will come from further reductions in Welfare. Did you catch that!? #ScotDebates
#ScotDebates Willie Rennie cannot give a reasonable explanation why the LibDems betrayed the country shamelessly 5 years ago. Sad.  #voteSNP
#ScotDebates @NicolaSturgeon stars many other countries have no nuclear weapons, Canada is but one example. #BairnsNotBombs #votesnp @theSNP
#ScotDebates this election is not about independence. Others elections may be - that's a matter for the people of Scotland. #VoteSNP #GE15
#ScotDebates @NicolaSturgeon wants to increase spending modestly to lift the poorest out of poverty. Ending austerity for thousands #votesnp
#scotdebate @NicolaSturgeon very clear and purposeful opening statement. @theSNP #VoteSNP #GE15
#ScotDebates Jim Murphy promises to increase everyone's wages paid for by raising taxes. Yet he wants to keep spending billions on Trident!
#ScotDebates Jim Murphy please understand if Scotland votes anti-Tory but pro Scotland, Cameron will not be in number 10 #voteSNP #GE15
#ScotDebates Ruth Davison having a tough time defending Tory policies in  Scotland. Will they join with UKIP? No she says. Believe her?
#ScotDebates Jim Murphy conveniently ignores the fact Labour don't have the trust the people on Scotland. Labour are wedded to the Tories.
#ScotDebates Willie Rennie cannot defend their betrayal of free tuition and the draconian Welfare Reforms imposed by the LibDems. #VoteSNP
#ScotDebates @NicolaSturgeon reminds Scotland of Labour &amp; Tory  privatisation agenda that has undermined the working class. #voteSNP #GE15
Jim Murphy forgets Labour could have provided the living wage decades ago but didn't. #ScotDebates
I suppose it was inevitable London based press would resort to their old ways in a crass attempt to have a pop at Nicola. Desperate stuff.
Great fun Easter Egg Hunt thanks to @InvernessBID and their team of dedicated Easter Bunnies! üòÉ Breagha loved it!! http://t.co/DFTROtpZDc
#bbcqt Danny Alexander says he doesn't like what the SNP NHS policies. What? Is that because he supports more NHS privatisation in England?
SNP leader @NicolaSturgeon  escrowed as a "fantastic leader" #bbcqt. They are right. @theSNP already calling the shots. #VoteSNP #GE15
#bbcqt Michael Grove states @NicolaSturgeon was the only credible leader in opposition tonight. That's apparent. Lab, LibDem fail.
