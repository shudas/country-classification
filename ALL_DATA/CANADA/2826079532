I love this show #TheRoyals
To the man who made all us oddball's feel like we belonged, thank you #LeonardNimoy
He played a man with no emotions who would not cry over anyone, but we all cry over him. #leonardnimoy
People come and go but I just hate it when the world loses a great influential person. So many more will come and go #LeonardNimoy
Still greaving but each day is getting a little better. #LeonardNimoy
You can't tweet a feeling...#LeonardNimoy
Alive in our hearts and minds never to be forgotten. Always missed. #LeonardNimoy
I wish I would have met him, and not from lack of trying. #LeonardNimoy
"Watch the skies" not his quote but I always remember it in his voice. #LeonardNimoy #Simpsons
I always felt like an oddball and I didn't fit in growing up, like I was a alien. I never met him but I knew I wasn't alone #LeonardNimoy
When I couldn't sleep at night I use to listen to the audio book "I am Spock" to relax me so I could fall asleep. #LeonardNimoy
RIP Leonard Nimoy. I wish I would have met you. Take care you will always be missed in my heart. #LeonardNimoy
