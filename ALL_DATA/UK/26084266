I bloody love jumping out of planes and stuff 🌚
It's that awkward time of the year where's it not warm enough to wear your summer pj's but not cold enough to wear your winter ones
I just want to throw myself out a plane, why must this be so difficult 😒
Why must there be wind 😭
I don't understand people when they say horse racing is abuse....was it child abuse when you were 5 and had to run the egg and spoon race?

I am in love with the #brumbiza mixtapes by DJ Yasmar

Time to introduce Einahpets to Mayfair........this could be interesting
Yes yes yes https://t.co/PTJjlUq6Lh

Now is not a good time for my work pass to break and lock me out of the whole bloody hospital when I'm due back to work now
I am so happy I paid £12 for a single vodka lemonade last night :)))))))) on a 'student' night as well :))))
To sleep or not to sleep ? 😑😑😑
Why did I not go to any of my bloody lectures 😠

The thought of having to start revision tomorrow makes me want to cry
Cannot wait to get back to Surrey tomorrow and sleep for a year 😴

People are so unnecessarily rude nowadays. Did your mum not ever teach you manners? ✋
I have no shame in the fact that I have spent 90% of my day in bed

Why do we spend 14yrs of our life at school learning shit, only to not be allowed to use any of that knowledge at uni &amp; have to use others?!
Happy birthday boobies 🎉

Why I kept telling the bouncer he was a beautiful chocolate man last night I don't know 😂
