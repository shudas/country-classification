Anything going on in Kent tonight?
People are just annoying the fuck out of me today.
Happy birthday @Bridgetbrately ❤️❤️❤️
I CANT STOP COUGHING
Will someone plz bring me nachos to eat while watching hockey plz
Shannen is probably really mad at me for eating all her pepperonis and cheese 😭 @ShanSholley2
Soooo many Canadian teams in the playoffs 😳
Home to watch the first Stanley Cup games with my daddy ❤️👌😍
Forever doing homework all day with @ShanSholley2
Breakfast with @ShanSholley2 &amp; @Tier_Is_HERE ☕️🍳🍞
Moving to wilmington in 26 days 👌🎉🚙☀️🌊
Lift up your eyes and see, the run is rising.
I can't believe @ShanSholley2 booked her flight back here from wilmington &amp; will be driving with me to help me move ❤️👌✈️🚙 #BestFriendStatus
I love how my friends can't hangout with me unless there's something going on. If there's not, they just waddle their way home.
Me &amp; Stevie = Best Friends ❤️ http://t.co/cQbiGp67M7
I'm always whining
Crazy something that you make me 👌
At least I get to spend the afternoon with the beautiful @m_russruss ❤️
Such a long morning/day already 😩😭
Why can't I sleep 😭
I can't believe I have to be up in 3 hours 😳
Having so much fun with @Hnalleyy &amp; @Kokivo &amp; @jonahisdunn 😂🎬🎥📹
I feel like death, someone bring me soup 😭
Ugh I'm sick! NOOOOOO
So much anxiety
Why am I even wearing a sweater today?
Today's the day! Becoming a brunette 💁
I hate fluffy towels.
Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go.
Literally the worst day of my life
Well tonight was not worth it

I've had the best night ever drinking with @ShanSholley2 &amp; ending the night on her couch alone watching Frasier with my wine 😂🍷❤️
Andddddd no one texts me 😂
Someone text me
#SaveDaniel @AmericanIdol
Thank god I'm leaving, no one wants to spend time here with me anyways.
It's going to break my heart when you find out you don't want me anymore.
Moving to wilmington in 5 weeks 😍
I'm so bored.
We are so fat what is wrong with us
All Shannen and I do is drink wine and eat Taco Bell.
If anyone wants to come over &amp; hangout with Stevie and I, message me &amp; let me know 👌

Bedtime I guess ✌️

If the music is too loud, you're too old.

I hate when I'm on the phone with someone and I have a mini heart attack because I can't find my phone
I don't know if Kylie put all this tape on the bathroom floor or if it's always been there &amp; I've just never noticed
Sonja's new plan- "I think I'm just gonna buy a car, sublease my apartment, sleep in my car and shower at planet fitness." 😂😂
Really missing @Rachelxoeli today 😔 Wish she could give me a motivational speech.
Every time I fold kids menus at work I hear @tiffwillyyy's voice in my head saying "fold to the corn dog" 😂
