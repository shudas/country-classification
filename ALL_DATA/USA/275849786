After sending a text about someone to that someone, I am SUPER paranoid about sending the wrong text to people now.
The struggle is real when you tell yourself you really shouldn't show up to class in yoga pants and a t-shirt for the 4th week in a row.
You know you love your job when you hang out there for three hours... after your shift has ended.
I LOVE THIS WEATHER. ‚òÅÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è
Drop Dead Fred. The one movie that would literally make me go insane if I were locked in a room and had it played on a loop all day.
The bible really is a love letter from God.
Successfully painted the nails of a wiggling, three year old.
Ok, we're all adults now and should have the intelligence to say "Remember", instead of "Don't forget".
Like, what's the point of having twins if they're not identical?
I think I'll actually enjoy my summer in Searcy this time around.
Just now getting around to watching the Justin Bieber roast. I have never laughed so hard in my life.
Someone at work didn't believe I was 25 to the point where I had to show her my license. Then she didn't believe that it expires in 2055.
Hell hath no fury like a woman been scorned.
The only filters I use are on Instagram. #realtalk #honestyisthebestpolicy
I love @chrissyteigen! She's my spirit animal.
Sometimes, I think women have babies just to have a new prop for their duck face selfies.
Since its Easter weekend, #tbt to a 90's candid Easter moment that perfectly embodies the Lewis‚Ä¶ https://t.co/1bXfBnRQZj

You know you go to Harding when you hear someone say "Jesus is always the answer"...
Going from not having a car to having a car to a car not working is very irritating.
Shout out to @STLSportsMind being an awesome friend.
The best feeling in the world is not having to set an alarm on a school day.
"What?! I thought that was a gang sign!" #sarahsays
Just woke up from a two and a half hour nap. Whoops.
How to tell someone doesn't have a soul... When they don't shed a tear when Goose dies.

"You're a lot brighter than you look." -Goose #TopGun
Lol at all these girls heartbroken over One Direction. Honey, you will never know heartbreak like when NSYNC broke up.
Pretty Little Liars... OHMYGOSH. üò±üò±
Homeboy on the subway talking to himself is telling our group that we're crazy. Oooook.
It should be a crime to be up this early.

Love the 80's music playing at Atlanta Apparel Market!
I walked 13,291 steps today, just saying.

I'm so tired of being white! I need this tanning weather to stick around.
Hey yo. If anyone knows any broken mandarin like me, I'd love to converse with you.
Can it be summer already? ‚òÄÔ∏èüåàüåä
I need a positive distraction from life.
Taking naps until it was time for work today was a bad life decision. #wideawake
I'm an idiot.
My prayers go out to the New York mission team who has already suffered a tragic loss.

When members of ISIS try to friend you on Facebook&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
I just don't want my fat rolls to turn into flappy skin! A simple "Do weights x amount of times each week" would suffice.
You can't just ever ask someone how often you should do weights at the gym.It's always "do this or do that and eat this and sacrifice that."

The struggle of not wanting to around people, but not wanting to be by myself either. #extrovertedintrovertproblems
Reading through @AnnaKendrick47 tweets. Like, she just gets me.

I wish I had enough belongings so that I could sell everything and travel the world.

Why is it that every time @birchbox sends me lotion, it ALWAYS smells like that lemon air freshener in a porta potty? üò∑
If @AnnaKendrick47 doesn't sit down on the stage of the Oscars and perform "Cups", I'm going to be REALLY disappointed.
My chiropractor is my most favorite person today.
Has it really only been a month since school started? It's felt like a lifetime.

Taylor Swift 1989. I'm. Obsessed.
You know how they make digital copies for CDs and DVDs? Yeah, they need to start doing that for books too.
I miss my twin.
Well, I found out that I'm still allergic to bunnies...
So what's up with snapchat not even having a story for the Super Bowl? That's one I actually wouldn't mind having had...
After the week I had, I'm treating myself to a well deserved mani and pedi.
I know the Seahawks are going to win because it's raining here in Arkansas and in Arizona!! #goodomen
Can't wait to start reading Gone Girl!!
