This debate has turned into a "let's get rid of Tories." Would be better to be represented. #VoteConservative #leadersdebate

A chilly day, a sunny warm day, a wet day in Aviemore. Standard three seasons in a morning! #vote4ed  https://t.co/UNpqr0TOLK
Nicola Sturgeon backpedals  http://t.co/Jix53J4kNZ Accepting FFA would be bad for Scotland. Break up would be worse. The dream has died.
SNP members following and filming opponents is vile and anti democratic. Has anyone apologised? Anyone?  https://t.co/X8EXlJHpNK
"Public" spending growth does NOT grow economy. Money spent has been taken from individuals and businesses that could have spent it better.
Take the @Team2015 survey: WHAT MATTERS MOST TO YOU? http://t.co/QDVdD5qpjL
See my "pick list" of parties. If you disagree with SNP  support  pro unionist, pro business party #VoteConservative http://t.co/byg7sAEEAB
LEFT policies don't work, keeping poor on welfare
RIGHT policies work, growing economy,  creating jobs, reducing poverty. #voteconservative

Read this excellent blog to see where FFA would drag Scotland. Why anyone would wish FFA on Scotland is beyond me. https://t.co/mtDWNEVlrY
Pro SNP responses are usually on the lower slopes of this chart; name calling or play the man. https://t.co/v3QQpshqKx
Anyone supporting the SNP in the election prefers the "dream" of "independence" over a more secure economic future in the UK.
Putting up signs today with Edward Mountain  #vote4ed. Please leave them up dear opponents, that’s part of democracy! http://t.co/OiofEOrIkP
SNP justifying FFA on R4 on the basis Holyrood would be able to select economic policies to create growth!
These people can't count! £7.6bn
#leadersdebate Not an easy gig @BBCJamesCook.   You did your best but Ms S still shouted over and sneered at others.
#leadersdebate Nearly finished. Soon time for SNP supporters to get online to fix the poll numbers for winners! #voteconservative
Ruth D reminds us that support for union is at heart of Conservative policy. #leadersdebate

#voteconservative
#leadersdebate Greens seem to be refusing to support a government that is  capitalist! Wow just wow. Just what we don't need -more socialism
#leadersdebate #leadersdebate Ms S seems to be getting more time than the others. Ruth Davidson doing well but Ms S needs to be controlled.
#leadersdebate Good to see audience member remind Ms S that she does NOT represent everyone in Scotland. #voteconservative
#leadersdebate NS plays the "oil fund" card. BUT you cannot build savings at the same time as spending the money. Spend it OR save it.
Sturgeon challenges Jim Murphy to vote for FFA. Be careful what you wish for SNP. FFA would cost Scotland billions. #LEADERSDEBATE

How can the SNP claim to work for Scotland and at the same time still call for Scotland to leave the UK, at huge cost to Scots?
If you vote SNP now you must know it will be taken as support for a rerun of referendum, in opposition to the vote of Scottish majority.
POLL: Who won the Scottish leaders' debate? https://t.co/u20YHgvt55                    Nicola on 76%. Wow not dodgy at all!
#ScotDebates Ruth Davidson walked it, with Jim and Nicola following well back the field and Willie a galant last. #voteconservative #vote4ed
#ScotDebates You could almost feel sorry for poor Nicky until you remember the lies she told pre indy, centralisation of police &amp; wind farms
Ruth to Jim pointing out the difference with Labour  "You crashed the economy I want to  rebuild the economy"
#ScotDebates Audience applause is unrelated to performance, with Nicola getting more than she deserves. How do we solve selecting audiences?
#ScotDebates Nicola Sturgeon did not perform well when faced with good questions from audience on Trident, on debt and Indyref. #vote4ed
Bernard pursuing Nicola on promise that referendum was "once in a generation". Good work from questioner.
Sturgeon trying to bully and carry on speaking over Jim Murphy. #ScotDebates Rein her in.
#ScotDebates Woman voting SNP "because SNP will speak for Scotland" man voting Tory "to keep economy on track" was less parochial
