And they had to choose between their whole(half) colony or their family. And the dilemma was this man's struggle w his own selfishness.
And the opposing is true. Let's say The Consciousness of a King was about the Governor's family being held hostage by some opposing force.
That he could not watch his people starve to death collectively. That is true desperation. And a very interesting theme.
Help arrived a few months later, and no one understood why he had murdered his people. He could not explain that it was out of mercy.
Instead of letting his people starve and die slowly and painfully, he murdered them quickly.
But it was a mercy killing. He didn't know when help would arrive, and their food was running low. The planet didn't have the resources.
The Father is identified by a young navigator to be the Govorner who fuckin murdered half the fcking human colony. So that's intense.
There's a theatre troupe being transported by the USS Enterprise. The two leads of the troupe are a father and daughter. #StarTrek
Or the citizens of their country. Like, #StarTrek explored this topic in a really cool way. The Conscious of a King has an interesting take.
WHAAAA WHat if it's like The Sacrifice. Leaders are like, informed that they needed to sacrifice millions of lives to continue their own.
