Andrea there is no tribe
When my stories hit right in the feels
Cute moments just for Andrea http://t.co/ZmTXLXeW8f
Andrea do not tweet anything about who we are talking about because they follow me and see everything. Fml
Andrea what http://t.co/K0GfydIoYu
Almost sent a dm to someone, which was about them. Fuck
I lost count of who is actually going to Blitz
There is honestly so many photos people haven't seen besides the main people I talk to (so like three people)
I still hate you
should of cropped that
Just found out the one person that treats me like absolute shit is going to Blitz on Sunday and I want to cry. Gunna be a great weekend :(
Do people actually use me as a height scale for band members? Like I know Peschk does and I'm pretty sure someone else said they do omg
Forgot I was only good for one thing👍🏼
And there it is
Ran out of band photos to post (not really, just look gross in them all)
But here have this photo… https://t.co/s3Nb4WBBMD
Important question http://t.co/bNsfBfJMMm
Do my friends not realise this is a serious issue
I can see you👀
😁 https://t.co/yWZvYe0e8I
Much refrets http://t.co/EPkYPOVy6d
I always tweet about 10 different bands at the same time and it always looks linked to one band, but it's not. I confuse myself tbh
You're the type of person that should be deleted, blocked and punched in the head
I remembered why I hate this band
Oh for fuck sakes http://t.co/5UVOgUnB8i
Did I save that picture or did it save me? http://t.co/g7fxIxjgKK
fUCKING HE LL PESCHK http://t.co/t2FjGvzC4M
Looked at old pictures &amp; realised most of the photos I took that day are of @GomezPunx, @BonAtlantic &amp; @TaakAtlantic http://t.co/IDWd75BUNK
When you're Peschk af http://t.co/7jMt5e5Plh
"Adelaide CBD, SA" okay http://t.co/K7JlfQG2XX
Sorry Peschk
I don't know why, but I get really nervous at gigs
PESCHK MESSAGE ME YOUR PICTURES
Also that time I took really bad photos of @StandAtlantic 😬✌🏼️ http://t.co/fZ97JkLN6t
That one time I took really bad photos of @undercastband 😁😎 http://t.co/NML1Nhv5kE
If you haven't worked it out, I'm having Stat feels and the EP is playing in the background and I'm emotional bye
Was DLM or With Con the last time I saw Stand Atlantic?
I miss @BonAtlantic :( bye
I honestly hate trekking it to gigs sometimes but then I remember I get to see and support my faves
If you don't have anything to do tomorrow night, you should go see @shortstackband, @withconfidence_ &amp; @StandAtlantic😁 You won't regret it👍🏼
I understand why people complain about my height now http://t.co/526ZDoANeu
Can this storm fuck off thanks
Tbh thought it was Vuka in the #mobsMAKEIT video, but realised it wasn't😔
Why is there so many gigs? Fml
Probs only go for Stand Atlantic anyway
Wish I didn't have such a sore back :(
Do I buy last minute tickets to Short Stack for tomorrow or nah?
Tbh didn't even know these photos existed😌 http://t.co/ahJlLlPqDb
So good boys👏🏻 Proud😁 #mobsMAKEIT https://t.co/tRTcPr6xum @JordanClarey @mickashfield @Mjapurcell @scotmac_
Everyone should check this video out. It is amazing. https://t.co/ChveTLyXVJ #mobsMAKEIT 
Well done boys 👏🏻👏🏻 @MoveOnBeStrong
Pulled a muscle in my back today :(
Can someone at the Adelaide show get me a vm from Chase Atlantic?
I really appreciate you💕
:(
If people really think I'm that much of a bitch, you really don't know me at all. So fuck you and fuck your indirects.
@ me
Late #mcm, early #wcw goes to @MarcusDayBreak http://t.co/d2U7DgqO3F
I'm going to bed bye
IT IS CALLED A JOKE
I'm not that much of an ass omg 
Tbh he can pull anything off
Here is a terrible photo I took of @SamExcess on Saturday😬👊 http://t.co/TTr0kuBuXw
Trust me, living with Type 1 Diabetes is not fun at all.
I have to grow my hair out for October and hope my boobs don't get any bigger before then
Can someone get me a vm from Chase Atlantic?
Appreciation tweet for @SamExcess because he is such an awesome dude tbh... like he is my fave! bye! http://t.co/bKRevdC14q
I'm really slow at replying to DMS and snapchats because everyone decides to dm/snapchat me at the same time and I get confused
I don't think I tweet much about how much I appreciate @KaneEndsHere😁 Like he is such an awesome dude &amp; so down to earth. He makes me happy😊
It's only 7:30 and I'm ready for bed
Guess who won't be seeing With Con anytime soon... This gal🙋🏻🙋🏻🙋🏻
I'm getting so worked up about this because it is stupid. Get your facts right before you fucking state anything
I'm so happy I linked people to @StandAtlantic's YouTube, because I've heard nothing but good reviews &amp; so many buying the EP #APlaceApart 😁
😒
