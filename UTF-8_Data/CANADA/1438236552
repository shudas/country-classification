"What is the horizontal translation of y=x^2?" 
This question harder to answer than Cheryl's birthday!

This begs the question: why is action, and not knowledge, the essence of education? #abedchat  https://t.co/Dy3JXBPSQ7
Too fuzzy. Students should start with mastery of content knowledge and build up to 4Cs. https://t.co/1S9dtEpCVZ

Great comment here by @rcraigen http://t.co/w7LPZZiW97 How *does* he come up with such articulated responses? Must be his growth mindset.

Exam room booking error. Even though fault was not mine, I took initiative to change rooms and not banter with the other prof about it.
