Hello?
Hopping back into the twitter-mobile.
It's fucking annoying having nonchalantly bitchy room mates. I mean, even if they are somewhat related.
Blah, alcoholic cousin being even more of a nuisance than ever. #intervention #1stworldproblems #hatemylife

Just threw down 68$ as a bet, I hope I win, or I'm broke..

I love being a bitcoin miner, and having that as my full time job. While everyone is asking how I'm making money all I say is hashing away.

Halo by Machine Head almost made me cry again.. Almost, maybe next time.
I don't understand negativity about the things you want. Like if you want something nice then get it, instead of making a fuss about not.
Just the life of a full-time #bitcoin miner. #BTC #bitcointalk #cavirtex #AMD
