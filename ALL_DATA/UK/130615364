Somebody be my pal and send me a DM? Thanks
To be fair to Ed Miliband, he was telling the truth. 

Nigel Farage would rather a Health insurance system.

Proof!

Woods "far right" pun to Farage had me dead üòÇ
Nigel Farage is about as appealing as a used fanny pad.
Why are all the good looking women from Glasgow? #ImMoving
When Farage said "the other two who didn't show up"

Was a bit confused and then went... "Aw aye! Clegg!"

Just shows how irrelevant he is
Watching the debate since I missed it
The fact that Farage thinks the BBC is left wing just goes to show how far right the man is.

Just watched IGNs "top 25 PS3 games ever"

And Fallout 3 never even got a mention! That is ridiculous!
UKIP manifesto says they will spend Billions more on the English NHS. 

Even though Farage was caught on camera saying he wants a US system
That rant got me in the mood for noodles...
A ken a cunt that voted naw because he wanted to still fly the Union Flag at Ibrox. 

(He didn't even know there was a Scottish Government)
Voting based on what team you support is probably about as stupid as choosing a wife based on their favourite flavour of Pot Noodle.
