We were in the elevator with an elderly man and he was like "girls I love you stay beautiful" as he left - what a sweetie!
STILL TRIPPING THAT I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO SEE DEMI IN AUSTRALIA

DEMI IS SUCH A QUEEN AND SHE IS SUCH A TINY LITTLE BEAUTY LIKE STOP I CANT HANDLE IT.
I FUCKING SAW DEMI LOVATO TODAY. IN GYM WEAR. MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.
Hi @kweenlovato just so you know? I love you 💋😍😘💕💖💁🏼
One of 10 of the 1st people who saw Demi not once not twice but 4 times today - that smile and laugh are to die for - feeling so blessed 💕💕💕
Done with this drama because @ddlovato would never want to see such negativity! Good luck to everyone! 💕💕💕

When Demi Lovato is in your country. http://t.co/wPVBm6lURa
There's so much shade and so many fakes.
Hi @adrixnpalaz , @kweenlovato just told me the reason I didn't get my Liam photo is cause of you. I was 2 peeps away okay. Good thing you
The fact that a band as shit as Masketta Fall is opening for Queen Demi is a fucking travesty
And the fake Demi fans appear...
With a bunch of Baes for Breakfast. Let Demi World Tour begin 😍 @kweenlovato @hannahbabyxo @itsShiralz_ @bowmetria
Waiting for the Vet to call me so not answering any phone calls unless you're the vet or my mum soz guys 😘😘😘
