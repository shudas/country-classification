love in spite of every reason not to.
I love God, but I don't love studying for New Testament.
nothing makes me happier than succeeding in things that I'm passionate about.
I am better as a memory
I need more girl friends
it's feeling like Texas here in Colorado 😎☀️👙

a breakup is a blessing in disguise because then you're no longer investing your heart and time in someone that doesn't want to be with you
today I am thankful that life hasn't been easy because it makes me cherish the good times.

"and the things I thought I hated are the same things that I miss the most"
it would take a lot longer than a "moment" to count all of our blessings.
life is good when you do what you love and love what you do.
Love never gives up. Love doesn’t want what it doesn’t have. Love always looks for the best, never looks back, but keeps going to the end.

sleepy
happy

my birthday was perfect.
2000 years ago Jesus was preparing to take his last breath so that 20 years ago I could take my first. Today is good.
that was the best start to today
Since I can't be at the game I turned on @WFWildcats notifications. 
Good luck tonight #21 😘

"I could be your sun

I could be your rock

watching prison break has made me have dreams that I am in the show, it's half exhilarating and half terrifying.
Be intentional in seeking good, because even on a "bad" day, you still had a beating heart and air to breathe.
I want to be an accountant.....
I feel like I'm in seminary because of my New and Old Testament Classes.
"sometimes we overlook the greatest blessings in our lives because they aren't exactly what we had hoped for."
I miss my moms cooking..
last season of Prison Break... idk what I'm going to do with myself once it's over.
I'll be in Texas in two weeks
There's two girls screaming at eachother outside my apartment.
Jake introduced me to Prison Break so I blame him for my addiction.
I don't wanna waste this life.
currently dying of sickness
I'm getting sick, tomorrow I have a Leadership midterm, two quizzes in Business, an Accounting 2 exam, and it's snowing. 
I need prayers
I want to stay in bed and watch Prison Break all day.
I like intentional people.
counting down the days til I see you❤️
