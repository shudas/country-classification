Hundreds feared drowned off Libya | Utterly heartbreaking. Truly, there are no words.  http://t.co/lw5lSbAbiM
Very fulfilling to have taken trout from pond to plate. Yum! http://t.co/vB0TbatPzY
Final day fishing on Isle of Lewis - fish plentiful. Off to @CrieffHydro for a few days tomorrow! :o) http://t.co/gMbjxCFpCM
Final Saturday away from my beloved @AirdrieoniansFC. Hope we can take 3 points against Forfar! I'm off in search of decent size brown trout
A good way to spend an afternoon on holiday. #FishOn! http://t.co/m3p3Dn0IZj
Lots of tweeting about non doms &amp; full fiscal autonomy. Number of votes that will win in marginal seats? Heehaw...
See what a strong group of SNP MPs will achieve! Get Tories out, get trident out - win, win! #voteSNP #GE2015  https://t.co/YWpnH9OF2i
UK tweeters in overdrive about FFA. Was on doorsteps of Stornoway today - FFA not mentioned. Canvassing Yessers who are solid SNP.
Does Jim Murphy see *every* policy through the prism of the back pages of a newspaper? #leadersdebate
Statesman like from Jim Murphy, there... #leadersdebate
The groaning from the audience every time @DavidCoburnUKip mentions Europe suggests he's barking up a gum tree. #leadersdebate
I wonder how looking down the camera, ergo ignoring the audience, plays with the audience themselves. #leadersdebate
After an afternoon fishing for votes with @alasdairallan, there was always time for a wee cast at Arnish. http://t.co/jP5rZMcQlI
Excellent results canvassing for @AngusMacNeilSNP in Stornoway this PM. #voteSNP #GE15 http://t.co/1EOwES4lbS
P&amp;J poll seems to show pretty clear win for @NicolaSturgeon from #ScotDebate. Labour ironically joint with Tories. http://t.co/JHtCM0G3Ww
Thoroughly enjoyed fishing Loch Ghobainn, Isle of Lewis, today.  Tremendous fun and plenty of fish to be had!
Great Easter communion service at Martin's Memorial CoS, Stornoway tonight. Plan for tomorrow: badminton and more fishing! #EnVacance
Tomorrow's breakfast with bacon. http://t.co/nFWqVKENO5
Fantastic day fishing Loch Cuil Airigh A Flod on Lewis. Nice play to win my first fishing competition! http://t.co/MHfprSFmph
OK - car packed up, rods at the ready. Time for a day's fishing. Good luck to @AirdrieoniansFC - sorry I can't be there to cheer them on!

Was in bed for 9.30pm last night - just caught up with all the Telegraph stuff. Couple of folks waking up this morning feeling a bit silly?
Caught this lovely wee brown trout tonight on Achmore.  Happy days. http://t.co/Fo7uV9ikiL
Pick up today's @ScotNational to read @hudghtonmepSNP's thoughts on the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean. http://t.co/UKs9tNVOtx
