Ugh PK! I try to like the guy cuz he's a great player- but he has the immaturity of a 12 year old

"Chewie, we're home" Wow..... so stoked!
Crazy night for hockey! PK drama , breathless double OT &amp; the Flames third period success continues. Bring on tomorrow!!!!
WOW!!!!! The Flames take the lead late in the third because.....well come on have you been watching hockey this season?
Duncan Keith plays 40 minutes &amp; nets the OT winner. Still not the hero. Darling played incredible for the Hawks
So that second bottle had steroids in it or something? Weird rule!
Holy cow!!!! Need a breather! Double OT coming up in #Smashville
End to end old time hockey in Overtime in #Smashville right now Insane game!
Flames Canucks game can't pull me away from Preds Hawks OT right now. This game is heating up!!
Hawks look like a contender again with the way they've battled back here
Come playoff time I'm the guy that roots for Overtime. All the time haha
I love how even the goal reviews have a sponsor this year lol.
Playoffs. Budget style http://t.co/slpgWIKznB
In b4 "the NHL is out to get the Habs" tweets

Off to the spOilers (hopefully) game with @Alberta_Kelly tonight! Shenanigans to follow!!
I know it's all part of the bus riding experience- but you'd think Greyhound would put the teensiest bit of pride in their depot bathrooms?
At Showgirls tonight supporting the sister station @Rock979 Yes. That's the reason. "supporting"
Came home to this on my window sill. Well played roommates. Well played http://t.co/SisdtHNDHG

Moving into a new place in December in #YMM means you don't get to see your backyard until March. Sweet - we even have a BBQ!
Who is this team and what have you done with my Oilers?
That said the 5.9% have spoken and congrats to Colleen Tatum! Looking forward to her getting back to work for us!  #ymm
I'm really proud of  #ymm and the people who live here most days. But when 5.9% show up to vote? Embarrassing.
Seriously though- go vote. This is an important swing vote. And you're "I'm voting by not voting" holds no weight here. #YMM
Oh man. What an excruciating 2 minutes and 30 seconds that was. Voting is hard..... #YMM
Oh my goodness!!! There is more parking open at Mac Island. Cue Handel's "Messiah" #YMM
Rollins wins!!!!!!! Are you freaking kidding me!!!!
"Suplex City, bitch!"
Sign: "If Roman wins, we remain apathetic" LOL
How many future WWE champions are accompanying Bray Wyatt to the ring right now? Time will tell #WrestleMania
ROUSEY! ROUSEY!!!
So this is their way of stalling for the sun to go down for Taker's entrance #TheRock
With Lesnar as a part time champion having John Cena &amp; Daniel Bryan gives the secondary championships credibility. Finally....
Can't believe I'm saying this but the WWE is making sense right now.
Did someone just huck a beer at Cena???
Bahahahaha. John Cena gets booed louder than the Russian.
This is gonna be an International Incident lol
Travis Barker! Can this please lead to a Blink-182 triple threat match?
Too much 90s. DX vs NWO and now Jerry Springer. What is going on??!!
This is. INSANE. DX vs NWO! #WrestleMania
"Those are human beings, damn it!!" #WrestleMania
So I'd think you want to keep the Undertaker/Sting matches separate. But don't they both require darkness?
So this means the InterContinental Championship means something again, right???? Right?? #WrestleMania #YesYesYes
Wow! That's a lot of announce tables to get smashed! #WrestleMania
LL Cool J is kicking off WrestleMania lol
Okay ordering WWE network. Wish me luck!
Anybody ordering WrestleMania in #YMM. Bars??
Leahy. Leahy Crockett. #ThingsYouCantUnsee
We need to make Liquorrito's a thing. Like now. #TrailerParkBoysSeason9

If there's one thing I can't stand it's NIMBY-ers #YMM  https://t.co/SMy5OxOwhx
I do this more than I care to admit http://t.co/YPYfT0kGCR
What's everyone up to on this fine #ymm Friday evening??
"Half-price Appies just don't taste the same when they're full price" #MikeLogic
Traffic fines also to increase 35%. I'm pretty sure #YMM is already that much higher over the rest of the province anyways
Tax the people that bust their ass for this province &amp; tax the simple pleasures in life- but how dare we increase corporate tax. God forbid
Even before tonight beer costs more in AB than Newfoundland. And the same as the freaking Yukon!! http://t.co/FHWJIwu2mC
Lined up outside the door at Safeway downtown gas bar. Busy day! #YMM

Derek Roy is probably the best thing to happen to the Oilers all season. Short list, granted.
In Roy We Trust!
