I was so excited to put my new umbrella in my bag this morning for work. #thisisliving haha
Safe to say I've eaten my monthly intake of sugar in one day.. Diet starts tomorrow. #cantmove #feelingfat #easter
Only 3 more hours until the great Easter feast #countdown #OrthodoxEaster
My office had a Easter egg hunt on Thursday..Clearly they didnt do so well. Im finding eggs hidden amongst all the filing Im doing #wining
So apparently autumn started today..
Adult go card fares will be the end of me. #whysoexpensive #translink
