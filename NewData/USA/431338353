hanging out with my sisters again makes me feel so at home. I missed this way too much.
hopefully going out makes me feel better. I'm so grumpy.
stay stuck on the past as much as you'd like, but I'd like to move on with my life.
I wish I could say I regret my past but my out look on life has changed so much and I owe that to everything I've experienced.
