Recommendations for a good hairdresser in Glasgow? Preferably central.
Haven't done drugs in 10yrs+. Not interested for myself, but for my son &amp; all our kids, we need to legalise n sell clean drugs #drugsluve
Prof Nutt says "skunk is a direct product of illegality of drugs" anyone who REALLY knows anything about drug-taking knows this!! #drugslive
I'm sorry but "just say no" attitudes toward drug-taking just piss me off!! Join the 21st century ffs!!
The VAST majority of problems with drugs is because they're illegal. Would you trust aspirin from a drug dealer in columbia??
Feed someone skunk n stick them in a scanner!! OF COURSE they'll get paranoid. I'm not a fan of skunk but this is just stupid!! #drugslive
Noone smokes skunk to remember inane facts!! Why are they testing this bullshit?? BBC should make a show wi people who KNOW about #drugsluve
