Is Andy Goode the only player in world rugby still to wear gloves? Is it due to the amount of pizza grease he normally has on his fingers?

Woke up to the news that Gayle has hit a World Cup double century. That's a man who has averaged 19 in one-day cricket for the last 2 years

Lorem Ipsum instead of England player ratings The Times newspaper today. Amateur.
So Qatar cleared of all corruption. Surely this makes the decision to award the WC to a small country filled with desert even more mental!?

India 152 all out. 8 batsmen scoring 5 runs between them, 6 of those batsmen getting ducks. And all that is after winning the toss! #EngvInd
Good old Bernie, successfully fighting bribery charges with tried an tested above board bribery.
Kadeen Corbin you've had a shocker
Technically Gary Ballance is 194 not out. Looking forward to him reaching his double hundred in his next innings.

Iran and Nigeria yesterday, Mexico and Brazil today. Why do you want to ruin the best World Cup EVER!? #fuckyouneymar #fuckyousholaameobi
A fabled Maouane Fellaini goal. I was starting to believe they were a figment of my imagination.
Goal line technology!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Switzerland deserved that. Mainly due to the Ecuadorian player not pinning the Swiss player to the floor after fouling him.
Another onside goal disallowed. This is getting ridiculous.
Pradeep with a real life Stick Cricket dismissal. I feel his pain, pressing the right arrow instead of the left.

Just the four tubes to work for me this morning.
Literally (seriously) I am the only person on the top deck of the bus and he comes and sits next to me. Would it be rude to move?
Sri Lanka 67 all out. England 16-0 off 3. Are they ahead on the Duckworth Lewis!?
The duckworth-lewis method only added on 12 runs. Has it been smoking crack!? It's shocking at adjusting 1st innings scores

Cricket is just better when the Windies actually have a team.
Bonnie Cooke has just taken my phone &amp; logged me out of Facebook to go on her own. Is this even socially acceptable?! I feel used &amp; violated
Lol at Robbie Savage and the only empty seats in Twickenham
Ha! to the man who has just emerged from the public toilet at South Ken station with bog roll wrapped around his feet.
I do love it when the flat above put their washing machine on a spin cycle at 22:15.

I do enjoy a post match interview with Adebayor.
What is that wire coming out of the bottom of Adrian Chiles's coat? Have they plugged him in to the mains?
Shot Eve.
Huge shot by Davie Murdoch. I can get on with my day and go to work now.
Hi @premierinn any chance of some hot water at your Springfield (Chelmsford) Hotel. Would quite like a shower before heading out tonight.
Think I've just spotted my first "Tube Spotter" at Vauxhall station. You don't need your anorak underground mate.
Absolutely buzzing for the women's curling today. Sweeeeeeep.
Guy on the tube with a white Sainsbury's carrier bag. When was the last time sainsburys carrier bags were white?!
Oh United, you're being beaten by a team of players whose names on Football Manager would be greyed out and you wouldn't be able to buy them

Do love it when the scoreline gets so ridiculous that skysports swap to a shot of the stadium scoreboard.
So proud of @_rachelpratt, she climbed over her first fence last night.
