Tell me your story and make me fall in love with you, all over again.
No school for me bcos I feel like death 😷
Besides my finger being insanely messed up, you're the only other reason I can't fall asleep
Maybe the only reason we keep coming back together again and again is because we're the atoms that finally found each other.
You're the best mistake I've ever made 💝
I hope I'm not falling into another one of your traps 😕😟
You know he loves you when he blocks you on Twitter 😅😘
You make me feel so complete and at the same time you're the reason for my heartbreak and I don't fucking know what to do
I FEEL SO FUCKINNG SICK SOMEONE HELP

It's sad how I haven't seen my aunt since I was a baby. We have so much in common and I'd love to see her again 😭
