#brothersfromanothermother
Just got done with having bronchitis, now I'm 90% sure I have an ear infection....cooooool
Another one of my friends had a baby this week...&amp; here I am- the only thing I'm concerned about is taking my nap at 3 in the afternoon
I might be driving through Colorado this summer !:) https://t.co/PggatgKPKn
Miss you so much boobs😩😭💔😘 @caseyjmartin
But first I need to tan since I'm white af
So, I only have 4 more days of classes til my summer begins. Then, I think it's gonna be time for a well deserved roadtrip to California

However today, by chance I found the old iPod, decided to plug it into a charger &amp; discovered that it's aliveeeeee ! #BestDayEver
I was completely devastated to lose my thousands of "legally" downloaded songs (thanks Limewire)...
One horrible day in 2009, my iPod classic (which I loved more than life itself) sunk like the Titanic to the bottom of a glass of iced tea.
7evaaaaaaaa https://t.co/fEzDlhs6Yv
k, halfway done. Just 1000 more words.
Atleast now I have coffee.
LOL, this term paper is gonna be so shitty. 
#dgaf only 4 more days of classes...
Papago apartment residents:if U hear obnoxiously loud country music coming from the 3rd floor-It's just me pretending I'm @ #CountryThunder
Thanks school for getting in the way of me listening to some great music &amp; being too drunk to remember it... 
#CountryThunder
@KMLE1079
WHY AM I NOT AT #CountryThunder ?!
Campus is so dead on the weekends. I kind of love it.
Thankyou @pandora_radio 4 creating the #SpringBreak2005 station. The perfect combination of teenage angst to motivate me to do my term paper
We're completely out of coffee filters, so one of my roommates used a paper towel as a substitute 😂😅
#CaffineAddict
Also, if I could just not write this term paper, that'd be cool..
I would really appreciate it if someone brought me coffee. K thanks. 
#CollegeStruggles
Attempting homework while on a large dose of promethazine codeine cough syrup is fun😛
Bronchitis ✅
Awesome...
Just a few more weeks til the end of the semester.. I can do this, right ?
Hate being sick 😩😭
The #BacktotheFuture movies are on tonight &amp; I'm kind of really excited....
My brother told me I need to cut my hair short again.
Why ? Because it looks better &amp; my long hair makes me look ratchet
#ok
All I want in life is chicken wings. Right now.
Had dinner made 4 me,then we made cupcakes,played pool,watched movies&amp;looked @ stars from the roof..yeah,I'd say it was a pretty good night
Such a fun night, can't wait for tomorrow
☺️💕
He thinks he's smooth, but I do like sunflowers..😅🌻 http://t.co/6SbWFTuTer
I just want to go lay in a field of flowers while it snows &amp; read a good book.. Is that too much to ask for Arizona ?!
I feel like @AnselElgort is kind of one of my spirit animals #isthatweird #ohwell 
Can we be koalas ? #theresnokoalaemoji
Chris just txted me, "I'm slightly day drunk". Txted him back, "I'm slightly proud. Great minds think alike"
😂 #SpringBreak
Day drinking cause #SpringBreak
Oh man, everyone's brackets must be completely messed up 😂🏀
#MarchMadness
HA #iowastate buhhh byeeeee 😂👋🏀
rain.rain.rain.rain.rain.
😍💕☔️
Green beer, learning to 2step, pool, new friends from Oklahoma, and getting kicked out of a bar. I'd say #StPatricksDay was a success🍀💚🍺
The car fell through ice at the lake today #Okoboji
#midwestisbest
Does my beer have to be green to be acceptable to start drinking this early ? 
#SeriousQuestion #StPatricksDay 
🍀💚🍺
Chris just txted me&amp;said,"I don't think that I could ever be an evil mastermind". Clearly we've been watching too many James Bond movies lol
Just hit 90 degrees here in #phoenix
😕🔥☀️
1st legal #StPatricksDay tomorrow.. What is everyone doing ?!
🍻🍹🍷🍸🍀💚
Can't wait for summer &amp; to be back in the Midwest 
#midwestisbest
All I wanna do is go to happy hour for $1 margaritas to celebrate #SpringBreak but instead I get to do homework #luckyme
#SprangBreakForever
I hope everyone has a great day &amp; an even better #SpringBreak ! 
☺️
Life is too short to be concerning myself with opinions of people who don't matter or care
Don't have any class today &amp; I was up before 10am....😒 #WHY 
#SpringBreak
There's an #ostrichfestival in AZ right now &amp; @coltford will be there ?! Whaaaaattt
Why is breakfast not served all day in the union ?
1 more test, 2 essays &amp; a project, then hello #SpringBreak
But actually, is it #SpringBreak yet ? 😩
So much homework &amp; studying to do &amp; all I wanna do is sleep #motivated 😒
Reallyyyy wanna go to a #SpringTraining game soon !☺️⚾️
All I wanna do today is tan, go shopping, then go to the gym.
My professor typed "http://t.co/tD5Ru2wldJ" into her google search bar, then was confused why it seemed like the page just refreshed...lol
Ben's surgery went well, thanks for the prayers &amp; good vibes everyone !
..Thankful for these learning opportunities.
Because I am shown grace repeatedly,I feel like I am continuously being tested&amp; put into situations to show grace to others..
So I'll just enjoy this moment I'm in right now.
Constantly stuck in between wanting short periods of time to pass by faster, but not wanting to grow up too fast..
Today is perfect☁️☔️💕
Missing my cousins/other brothers😩 just a couple more months til we're all reunited ! @dcastle56 @Chris_2the_pher
Got a "trim", feels like I basically got my head shaved.. #baldpeopleprobs
If y'all could keep my family in your prayers &amp; send some good vibes this way, it'd be much appreciated !
Growing up &amp; figuring things out is one of the most difficult, but also rewarding life experiences
Of course I have the most homework and a CLC presentation due the week that I feel like I'm going to die..
I have absolutely no patience for grown ass men, (who are older than me, might I add) acting like little boys.
&amp; if I somehow manage to actually do my hair and make up...basically a miracle.
Some people my age or younger already have careers,families&amp;their own houses.It's honestly a success for me just to make it to class on time
Whoever wants cupcakes, I baked some today &amp; they're up for grabs.
Except 1 is on reserve for @TeseAigbokhan
Ew, why did I just have the overwhelming urge to go get acrylic nails ?..
If I could have anything rn, it would be #tacohouse @bojiprobs
Just found out my fav has a Twitter #GaryJerryLarryTerry 😂 @JimOHeir #ParksandRec #spiritanimal
Still have an hour to do my DQ's, so it only makes sense that I'm on every type of social media procrastinating as long as I possibly can...
Sorry to the guys that live below us, we decided it would be a great idea to rearrange all of our furniture at 10:30 at night.. lol
I think it's time for a new tattoo or piercing..however, my bank account seems to disagree 😭 http://t.co/o9Rt9tEnK7
It's naptime 
#collegelife #donotdisturb
Forgot I had a major benchmark due today, not even worried about it 😅
#welllkindaworried #collegestudentprobs
It's so nice out today ! I think I'll have a drink &amp; do some homework by the pool :) 
#ThankfulForTheLittleThings
Not rly into #ValentinesDay but wishing this guy was here, cause I guess he's alright sometimes.. See you soon-ish @MadManMalusa 💕🙈

9 1/2 hrs of sleep in the past 3 days..Might as well just stay up at this point. Maybe I'll just make breakfast for the roomies😋
I was so hungry when I got home,walked into my apartment&amp;saw trash from @innoutburger, ate some almonds #BasicallyTheSame #NOT
😅😭😩
Just spilled hot wax all over myself... So, that was fun....
My phone died last night, which meant my alarm on my phone didn't go off this morning &amp; I missed my first class.... Coooool... 😒
90's at noon 🎶👌💕
Note to self: when you haven't drank any coffee in a month, don't start right before you're trying to go to bed...#RunningOn2HrsOfSleep 😧
It's 9:45 &amp; I'm ready for bed. I'm blaming it on the NyQuil, and not the fact that I'm turning into an old woman..
  #TooOldForTheTurnUp
The raisin to almond ratio in the trail mix I bought is like, 828373 raisins to 3 almonds...😒 #naturescandy #RemindsMeOfWrinklyOldPeople
Watching How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days while doing homework &amp; drinking coffee. Plus, I have the apartment allllll to myself.
#PerfectSunday
Needless to say, Jess &amp; I have now bonded on a whole new level..😂🙊👯
Thought all my roommates were asleep,so I walked out of my room-completely naked..yeah,Jess was still awake&amp;proceeded 2 walk out of her room
Just 2 more DQ posts &amp; I'm free for the rest of the evening !

"I loved you at your darkest"
Romans 5:8
This verse is really hitting home lately.
Over this whole being sick thing.. Definitely not the business.
Thank you drunk me for putting gatorade &amp; pedialyte next to the bed for when I woke up- #youdarealMVP 🙌
Just found out @ThomasRhett is going to be in AZ !!!! Can't contain my excitement !!

The people that live above me apparently think it's acceptable to pick up anvils&amp; drop them on the ground repeatedly..
NO, IT'S NAPTIME😒
U of A bound 
#RoadTrip #tucson 🚗🐻
So hungry, but already sick of school food &amp; I don't wanna go grocery shopping #CollegeStudentProbs
Haven't had a class even close to this early since freshman year.. I don't even know what 9AM is ?... #help
Ended 2014 &amp; started 2015 the best possible way I could imagine 
👫❤️🎉✨🍻🍸🍹🍷
I need to stop going to bed @ 4am so I can start waking up before noon...
Just thinking of the hangover I'm about to have on New Year's Day is making me feel nauseous.. 
#NewYearsEve
Haven't gone to sleep yet..praying there's not a screaming baby on this 3 hr. flight.. #ATLbound
Wes &amp; I are too intense when it comes to #TriviaCrack we need help
Dear John is on FX 😅😭😳✉️❤️
&amp; the countdown begins... 11 days #ATLbound
Know what's always weird to me, is when you have multiple friends who have the same 1st &amp; middle names..
I had the strangest dream that I was attacked with a shopping cart by a homeless person who wanted to sing me Christmas carols..
Shoutout to @ScottyLundell !! It's yo graduation dayyyy ! Congratulations- hope your day is awesome :) 
#collegegrad #welcometotherealworld
I hate @Cody_Wahlers 
Also, @Josh_Wahlers thanks for all the orange juice.
#YouDaRealMVP
YOUR ALARM IS GOING OFF PLEASE WAKE UP &amp; TURN IT OFF BEFORE I START SCREAMING
ARE WE DONE WITH CLASSES, FINALS &amp; ASSIGNMENTS YET ?!
I despise online CLC projects #GCUproblems
Y is breakfast not served all day,everywhere?! I think that could potentially save lives,create world peace&amp;end global warming #yourewelcome
All I want in life is breakfast from Chick-fil-a but I never get up early enough, thunderalley is too far &amp; I look ratchet af in the morning
Who tf is this girl sitting next to me while I'm studying ?...
Oh my gosh, the conversation Wes &amp; I just had #icanteven hahahahha😂

Why is luggage so expensive ?! Also, why am I looking at @eBay for luggage when I should be writing my papers...
#finalsweek
I WANT TO SLEEP BUT I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO &amp; WE'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF COFFEE !
 #sendhelp
All I've accomplished today is drinking mass amounts of coffee &amp; dancing &amp; singing around the apartment
#finalsweek
Napping is the only productive thing that I do with my life anymore 
#finalsweek
Seeing all the snapchats of the #ArtFestival in Miami &amp; I'm so jealous I'm not there😩
Crossing my fingers that classes get cancelled if there's more rain 😂😅
Someone tell me why I get kicked out of the apartment that I pay for over Christmas break just because it's on campus ?..
Sent Wes a letter in the mail, he absolutely loved it..I think snail mail is gonna be our new thing ❤️📝✉️
Woke up this early just so I wouldn't miss the @TheIowaHawkeyes @Huskers game !!
