Don't come for me unless I call for you. ✋ #TylerOakleyTaughtMeThis
I'm sitting down cause you're taking up all my workspace and you're taking forever doing whatever you're doing,not because I'm fucking lazy😒

There are a lot of one days that I want to achieve. One day, I will have achieved them all.

How an Orangutan can get stuck up in a tree, I will never know.
I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't colour inside the lines

I'm still working on my masterpiece
Only 2 weeks in, and I can't ever imagine the day I leave them behind.
