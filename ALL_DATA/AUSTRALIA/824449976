My friends from Minnesota are arguing with me about hockey... I'm sorry we've been making the playoffs longer than your team has existed💁🏼
I wish I was home watching the wings game one of the playoffs with my best friend and a beer❤️🐙🍻
Wait... Less than 24 hours left in Australia... Where did the time go? I'm not even at the airport yet and the emotions are flying😭
So perfect and so true☺️❤️ https://t.co/maMNplbGwv
Some people just make my heart melt ❤️ Spread your good vibes and good things will come your way in return. http://t.co/JbXwheQKoJ
Happy Birthday Ambs!!! Miss you and can't wait to celebrate😘😈🍻 @AmmberAnderson
I don't want to lose my tan😭😭😭 http://t.co/8FrvXGOiTU
Qualities I look for in men: smart, funny, buys me pizza, owns a trampoline, watches hockey, &amp; pulls a beer out for me when I come home
As much as I haven't been excited to come home, I'm so excited to party in Saginaw again 😏🍻
The simplest things are the most extraordinary things
Suddenly you want to travel, but all you've done is look down on me for traveling for so long 🐸☕️
Can I just pretend to go home and actually fly back to Newcastle this weekend? 😢
Don't trust people when they tell you they're different... Make them prove that they are.
And on the 95th day she met Kangaroo Jack #twodaysleft 😢 http://t.co/27UkI23lyt
I have very limited patience for reality
Everyone thinks 60 degrees is so warm and I'm going to be in a winter coat in that weather when I come home Saturday 😭🙈
I'm so glad people are actually starting to understand my true love for pizza😍🍕

Wait... I'm going to be 22 years old this year? That sounds so old😭😒
Stop looking for things to go wrong, just because you're used to tragedy doesn't mean you need it in your life to feel comfortable.
Three days left in Australia😳😭
There is no "we" in pizza.
Okay crying because of snapchats from @milymoyy and @KailynLittle 😭❤️
I'm not ready to go home in 6 days😭
So many goodbyes have been said the past 2 weeks and they are all harder than I would've imagined 😭😔
Because what's life without a little thrill? ✈️ http://t.co/YTzmw6VONX
Already had to say goodbye to one last night, don't want to say goodbye to the other this week😭😭😭 http://t.co/xqHCToSWXT
I just jumped out of an airplane. http://t.co/lMWYpuVNtH
Never lose your sense of wander http://t.co/ES2T6DrURv
Everyone's hating on my choker, but fuck y'all because I love it💁
Baes🔥😍 http://t.co/95zvrMAatW
I think I'm in love with the Gold Coast 😍
Sydney was good to me http://t.co/CauCQZ7IeB
It's not rocket science to figure it out
Maybe if you invested your money into experiences rather than useless material things then you could do it too
I find it funny when people who only wear name brand things ask me how I have the money to travel so much
I've gotten 7 free drinks from the managers of this bar since I've been here... Is this real life?
I just bought a beer and got a free pizza... This is my kind of bar😍
I will never get sick of this place http://t.co/0Je2T9fcd6
Some drunk girl just offered me some French fries and we're now bffs
Sad to be leaving all these amazing people, but I feel so privileged to have had them in my life the past 3 months❤️ http://t.co/fTF2MYSWYw
Just figured out I can go to Thailand this December for 10 days for less than $2,000... I think that might be my next trip
To have money when I get home or to buy a coordinates bracelet...
The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experiences
Home💕 http://t.co/I0NwcFB9Ue
I can't believe tomorrow is my last day in Newcastle😭
Craving a Bloody Mary right now, worst thing about Australia 😭
I'm going to have to delete my timehop before next year, otherwise my Australia posts will make me insanely depressed😭
I've wandered everywhere and I was never alone, for the world was always by my side #slowyourselfdown http://t.co/P1NEQjjy8l

I don't understand how it's physically possible for me to be so clumsy
I have all the Harry Potter movies on my computer, but Goblet of Fire doesn't work so I have to skip it... this is wrong on so many levels 😭
I've met some pricks in my day, but you sir are a fucking cactus🌵
This little guy is all I want right now😭 http://t.co/EsNumB959A
Live your life to your upmost potential for you and for everyone who ever believed in you.
He taught me everything I know about life, "Create your own reality through your dreams" is what he always told me... Best lesson I ever had
I'm convinced that it's harder to do homework in Australia than it is anywhere else in the world
If a guy isn't willing to show he's proud to have you then he isn't worth your time
Selfie with the awkward couple in the corner of the club showing way too much PDA 😂🙈 http://t.co/708bFxjPML
I am why we can't have nice things
I really want to get another tattoo before I leave Australia
Plunge boldly into the thick of life and seize it where you will http://t.co/ZGQPu01PgJ
My biggest fear is being stuck in one place for my entire life
Last day of work today, now time to play in Australia for 23 days😜🙌
Stop wishing for tomorrow and start living for today
I'll be home April 18th! Let's get the squad back asap when I'm back 😜 @joshbeau @milymoyy @f_lesperance @djpattip989 @twsimmon
