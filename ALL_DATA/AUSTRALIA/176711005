If you have to use "I have many friends who are ..." in a sentence to justify your position, it usually means that position is bad.

Aus really is a geologist and palaeontologist dream.
Geology is awesome.
Biology is just so interesting.
I wish I studied sciences more at school. Poor teacher quality put my off at the end of my schooling.

What a good egg. There is no way I am currently any level of attractive.
I am so pale, with stuffy red eyes and a dribbling nose, mouth breathing loudly. My baby comes over, pulls the blanket up, "my beautiful."
It's been about a month since I last played destiny.

Watching Mockingjay currently.
#NetflixDownUnder anyone have any wisdom as to how much? What will be excluded? Etc?
I'm gonna try and sweat the sick outta me. Got a knit and blanket in my knee, water bottle ready to hydrate. Bring it illness. I am ready.
Have a big day tomorrow and feeling not too crash hot atm. Fingers crossed I perk up tomorrow morning.
Saddened to hear of the passing of malcom Fraser. Vale hon Malcolm Fraser.
Blueberry is the best flavour of muffin.
Harry Potter.
Thanks for those media teams reporting the melbourne incident without using the accused name. A victim focus is where we should stay.
In reality probably prefer fruit ones but still freaking delicious.
Tried choc chip hot cross buns for the first time today. Thanks for the heads up guys. Why was I not directed sooner? http://t.co/qjc487Z2LX
Just lovely to see that type of support for your partner and child. Was really nice.
Because they had a young baby (the most beautiful cheeky girl who made raspberries and cooed) and he was there supporting her &amp; caregiving
Actually, there was the most beautiful couple in CSE today. The wife was participating in the course and the husband came to help (cont)
In serious need of a puppy right now. I need to cuddle something soft and alive and give it affection.
This news cycle is heart breaking. Can we please talk about positive things. #tellmethegood
