How is that possible? https://t.co/L6rUfnGiDs
Hannah Montana was THAT bitch! 🙌👑 https://t.co/6W02pE8yeK
Nicki Minaj never needs help. 💋 https://t.co/WSA7t7KFuE
Everybody knows Madonna is the Queen. https://t.co/VqHyq2Pzsf
Has it really? Didn't know people actually bought her music. https://t.co/N0JCuEJWNO
Please, remember December!
Only people who believe being gay is a choice are people who believe Jesus wrote the bible. Smh https://t.co/cutnoyfr7g
She could do so much better, but I guess money make bitches say yes.  https://t.co/mlgPyrG9fP
This. Bitch, you playing! @NICKIMINAJ @davidguetta @djafrojack  https://t.co/x0FSzWTyja
He can demolish this....🙊🐱💦😂 https://t.co/i6kJhVEdZK
"To keep you from breaking my heart..."
Me waiting on "The Boys" by @NICKIMINAJ to become @Vevo certified. http://t.co/oVfigFM1iz
A recording studio? 👀 https://t.co/5afgRonVGL
Just because 🙊🌸 @carlyraejepsen #IReallyLikeYou http://t.co/0VJqszHdnI
Oomf's **** is big. I wanna touch it! 😊😂
If there's no choreography in this video, I'm fighting you, @NICKIMINAJ! #HeyMamaOniTunes http://t.co/dGndegnBHm
Smh. That's a great song. https://t.co/Qlw2j8OfTr
I'm assuming this is from the video? 👀#HeyMamaOniTunes @NICKIMINAJ @davidguetta @djafrojack http://t.co/KiNlwR6Q51
The next single? We haven't even gotten "The Night Is Still Young" to chart yet.  https://t.co/QFcGnaqoOd
OMG!! I'm in tears @ the fact that it's about to take over the charts!!!! 😊 https://t.co/1XM74x14rd
I have said it before. The only thing Iggy Azalea does better than Nicki Minaj is that she cares enough to promote. Nicki doesn't care much.
Everyone knows how much I love what @IGGYAZALEA does w/ her music, but I hate when her fans come at @NICKIMINAJ, as if Iggy music is better.
"I get more nervous in front of small audiences than I do big audiences." - @ddlovato
If you really respected Nicki Minaj, you'd keep her name and her fans out y'all mouth. PERIOD. ✌️
Of course yall choose to play the victim as if yall don't try to come for Nicki also. OK. This shit urk me. 😒  https://t.co/s4Ae0EsH1R
And don't say that the BARBZ are the ones who started that because THE WORLD started it. Everyone hates I-G-G-Y. 😒 https://t.co/zahwSgBaAC
I was going to shade this with the fact that "Trouble" is flopping, but you're right. Iggy is JUST FINE. 😊 https://t.co/wJ5CxAI0zv
Yassssss! https://t.co/3kkqYUdz4V
That's not his ex, but k.... https://t.co/jOVwycrLco
Im going to block you. You always making something up. https://t.co/26CsGTVt2Q
Yassss @ "Hey Mama" coming for the a Top 20 spot soon!!!! 🙌 Need a damn video, @NICKIMINAJ @davidguetta @djafrojack https://t.co/q21DrNyo3w
"Not a dollar in my pocket, but I rock it like I ain't broke!"
"Here we are now. Everything's about to change." - @MileyCyrus
"Swing My Way" still feels right, @bobatl @sevyn 🌸😌
I bought @Kiesza's album a while ago, and I'm just now actually getting to listening to it in its entirety. 🙌😊
Hard. Rock. Steady. Rock.
Queen 👑 https://t.co/SgU8huqxZf
Didn't realize I was listening to Beyoncé album. I just knew I was over her twerking without thinking. 😢
Yassssss!!  https://t.co/8cjds8EbO8
Danity Kane could've been sitting at the top of the charts right now, showing Fifth Harmony how it's done. #NoShade http://t.co/qgWoPukVzy
"Ordinary Girl" and "Que Sera" were the best songs from Hannah Montana's last days. @MileyCyrus you've always been amazing! 💗
I'm blocking you. https://t.co/2KGHqENxJ1
Somebody find me his @ name because I'm gonna drag him to hell.  https://t.co/YaMnP2s4U4
Yall remember when Hannah Montana (@MileyCyrus) worked with @IyazLive? "This Boy" used to be my song! 🙌
Why was "LA Boyz" by @VictoriaJustice and @ArianaGrande ignored?!?!? This is pop, summertime goodness! 🙌🌸🏄💋
"Not a dollar in my pocket but I rock it like I ain't broke." - @VictoriaJustice
Miley Cyrus (or Hannah Montana), Demi Lovato, and Selena Gomez use to be the Holy Trinity. 🙌
"We may be apart but I hope you always know you'll be with me wherever I go." - @MileyCyrus
If Hannah Montana (@MileyCyrus) and @EmilyOsment's song "Wherever I Go" didn't make you cry.... You didn't love that show like I did.
Hannah Montana's (@MileyCyrus) song "It's All Right Here" was so perfect!
"I'll never ever let the world get the best of you. Every night we're apart, I'm still next to you." - @ddlovato #MadeInTheUSA
"I wanna talk back, and get yelled at! Fight for nothing, like we use to!" 

These lyrics made me love @ddlovato! #GetBack 🙌👑
The Barbz are just concerned about Nicki Minaj. We all wished after SB that she'd end up with a rich white man. 😊
Hannah Montana's album slays all of your faves, tbh. 🙌
True, but Miley let herself go. Her voice is a waste now.  https://t.co/qO7paAT7Fv
Demi Lovato is my favorite singer. She be singing her ass off! All her songs have messages too. 🌸
Say you'll be my nightingale.. 🌸
Baby Mama http://t.co/QZ0RpYgakQ
I don't hate Aubrey O'Day, I hate her as an artist. She should just stick to reality TV because as a musician she's typical.
"and you my bitch, I don't even have to walk you!"
BARBZ WHY YOU NO FOLLOW ME? 😩 I need more of you in my TL.
If it had a damn video and performances, it might could. *side eyes @NICKIMINAJ @davidguetta @djafrojack* https://t.co/yXh1NV1j9Z
Yasssss for this tweet! I really needed a video for "Bad Intentions" tbh. https://t.co/XDnJ4TKYBG
People.... Nicki Minaj has known Meek Mill for years. Let this "she hasn't even known him long" bullshit go.
Crack the Top10, please!!!! 🙌👑💍 https://t.co/OpJjlJRFst
Who wouldn't want to marry @NICKIMINAJ? Like.... You'd have to be gay as shit! http://t.co/qK8lAN6gvX
Bitch, Lil Kim fans stay with the bullshit. Go listen to that PayPal bitch and call it a day. Nic ain't even buy it. https://t.co/LlFwCgmn1O
why so angry ? chill . . . 😂 https://t.co/iY2DRL6Tn3
DROP THAT KITTY DOWN LOW!
Petty 😂😂😂😂😩 https://t.co/B8Qjlyf7B5
I always forget that Missy Elliott was on Katy Perry's song "Last Friday Night". Nicki Minaj would've gave a memorable verse.
Nah, she might've said "Yes, I suppose." 😊😂 https://t.co/3RP1Z96c8j
Yes, until Aubrey and Shannon admit they were wrong too, and stop playing victim, there's no closure. https://t.co/uOEdqvmS80
Assumably. She has not confirmed anything. https://t.co/vFoHO1WrK9
💀💀💀💀💀
RihRih https://t.co/fShmIA2Ara
😂 I fucking love you, Angel! https://t.co/TGq99gwDfi
surround yourself with people who are actually good for you and this wouldn't be a problem. 👌 https://t.co/B3dXL3Shii
Y'al dogging @NICKIMINAJ &amp; @MeekMill relationship as if your parents didn't just fuck, conceive, and split. 😊 #ItsHerLife
Maybe that's why @NICKIMINAJ sent Roman away. 😊😂 https://t.co/1RXoX8uguz
As long as they're avoiding each other, the feud between fans will still exist. That goes for all members of DK. https://t.co/btLJHtKgSo
Who had HipHop &amp; Pop on one album? Whose punchlines still were the fucking baddest? Who the fuck took over the game in only 5 years? 😊
When FACTS piss the bitter bitches off, everyone is assumed to be a teenage faggot. It's so sad.  https://t.co/kkS1Epzvf1
Girllllll....😂 What was an Iggy in 2013?  https://t.co/lMlgZLryPz
Yassssss for this shade!!! 🙌 She deserved this. https://t.co/AzonaRKXms
It's obvi not a publicity stunt. She's finally enjoying her life. Why is that a problem to the world?  https://t.co/a8C9TsCTir
Can't compare her to Kim. Kim got with Kanye and had a child and they're fine.  https://t.co/sXyad3Ur3W
The fact that "The Night Is Still Young" (which isn't charting) and "Hey Mama" haven't had videos released is why I'm a bit irritated.
They're irritating me with these bad decisions. Why not release a video while the song is doing good?! https://t.co/T42bHS8g3e
If @NICKIMINAJ and @MeekMill are engaged, which I doubt, I support it. I just don't want her to be in a Ciara and Future situation.
This is why Lil Kim's Grammy doesn't matter. Nicki Minaj could buy her discography, to be honest. 😊 https://t.co/BNFOoiR7yC
Why you put all them in one tweet? 😂 https://t.co/ppCTYCyv1n
Excuse the hell out of me! 🙊😩 https://t.co/GV9dfS31GP
http://t.co/Ju808oQjAH
Need to wash my hair!!
Post what bitch?!!?!?! https://t.co/d7ru0UZ86B
WATCH!!!! https://t.co/O1KiMXJ9sd
So the truth must really hurt, huh, @RASHEEDA? 😂 http://t.co/Wt07TRFRda
Am I the only BARB who actually loves when Nicki Minaj wears her own hair instead of the wigs?
Guess what, @RASHEEDA @TamarBraxtonHer @ToyaWright, y'all look stupid now. @kmichelle deserves an apology from all you hoes!
Give it up for them LA Boys! 🙌 @ArianaGrande @VictoriaJustice
Selena Gomez &amp; Demi Lovato - Studio DC Almost Live http://t.co/gB0PlNyocC
Tinashé reminded me of @LoganLaurice in her new video for "All Hands On Deck". http://t.co/Rv9oDB6NOw
In the mood to lay in the bed watching videos.
