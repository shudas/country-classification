Love watching Dioner Navarro run.
Love it when pitchers aren't afraid to pitch inside. Andrise just totally set up Martin and dropped the deuce on the outside corner.
Russell Martin with a sparkling .050 avg so far this season...
What's cooler than his and her üç∫üêç shirts? Uhm nothing! Available in men's and ladies' sizes! http://t.co/mcUmksB10P
Any one interested in a üç∫üêç shirt can pick one up at Garden City Mall tomorrow night between 5:30 and 6:30 for $20. http://t.co/VodVyXBCGa

Beer Snake Selfie. Just in time for the playoffs. http://t.co/kesOZ77es7
Jeff ONeill is still a butt plug.
So Thorburn scored a game winning goal and Pavs had a 0.0 GAA last week?
Not gonna lie it was pretty hard to leave this yesterday, but no way I'm missing the playoffs man! http://t.co/7rVhHtPeC4

See you guys later going to Cuba for a while....
Nice to see something written about Kane objectively. http://t.co/WsYKG2TK6A
So my Filipino math tells me if the Red Wings beat the Wild the Jets who are in a must win situation would pull within one point with a win.
And in other news Marion Berry waits by his phone for his call from Cooperstown.
Just saying, I called it. https://t.co/kM3WnYZaxF
Jets Win!!!! Undefeated when my Caucasian son is in attendance! And sorry haters @arby_18 is a true blue fan!! http://t.co/uFdNcrROVj
Guy getting tossed in section 32; wearing a Bure jersey just cause he was defending himself I guess. Crowd was all over him.
That's not a good sign..
Note Scheifele is not good at skating backwards.
E for effort though Frenchy!!
Guy in front of me wants to see Pardy on the PP..... I'll have what he's having please!
Most important period of the season!
Must be a defensive reflex of his to bellyflop everything he's in trouble.
Nice meeting @tzdcs at the game. #GoJetsGo
Uhm this could easily be a 6-3 game right now. Gotta tighten it up.
Fucking Sedins gotta tell the Men In Black to revoke their Earth privileges..
Got ID'd buying a beer today. Guess I'm looking all kinds of sexy today. http://t.co/3pGrUUFjW6
I guess it's not a good idea to leave a Sedin all alone in the crease...
Me likeee 85-18-67....
Three more years!!!
Slater gonna Slate!!
At the game with my Caucasian son Gabe. His first game so obviously we're gonna win! http://t.co/lKR9bUx4hB

Taking my step son to his first game today sitting with @arby_18 . Should be a memorable day!
Summer of Sound Tickets Available. DM me for details. http://t.co/R2me5mscSU
Only problem with knowing that Young's is open on Good Friday is that every Asian in Winnipeg knows it's open too, EVERY ASIAN IN WINNIPEG!!
Hey Young's is open they said. Go get some good Asian food to cook they said. We can have a nice seafood dinner  they said... Shoot me now!!
