That's pretty good  https://t.co/qZdvkgVZ7i
Boom @NickPaul27 3-2 @OHLBattalion
2 man advantage for 2 full minutes with no goals. Uh-oh
These #cogeco cameramen are terrible. I haven't moved but I've missed half the game #getittogether
Ummm hey @OHLBattalion the second period has started FYI
Boom 2-0 @OHLBattalion
1-0. Good start @OHLBattalion
I can't believe the @MapleLeafs started Bernier over Reimer tonight. I hope he goes somewhere where he's appreciated next year #TMLtalk
Ok @Cinemax can you get going on seasons 4-10 of @Cinemax_Banshee now. I don't like this waiting
If Ottawa is +300 to win their first series I'm taking it
There are hot streaks and then there is Mark Stone
These @BlueJays are looking dangerous. I am getting nervous to see who the injury bug is going to take out of the lineup first
Are the refs from ottawa tonight? #TMLtalk
Where the hell was this play all season? @MapleLeafs
Wow. Stay classy Kentucky
Let's go #Duke. Michigan state's run ends here #DukevsKentucky
I just crushed my family in "frozen" monopoly. No free rides in this house
Do you think Ellis is in Kentucky's head? #MarchMadness #Kentucky #Cincy
At 38 I'm at home with my 5 yr old watching Disney jr and drinking a 6 pack of Guinness #old
In my 20's I used to take the day off work and line up at the bar at 11 AM on St. Patrick's day. #goodtimes
Pretty excited to see what #teamproctor has in store for the finale @Cinemax_Banshee @UlrichThomsen @Liliflower33 @mattyrauch
Shut up Healy. Always lots of criticism by a former marginal player
Blues/Habs parlay +134 while we are at it #betwithyourheadnotyourheart
I hate to say it but Blues -1.5 +170 over the leafs
Someone should have shown this to @MitchyT29 before the Xmas party right @whitmac56 @dirt5772 http://t.co/B82lFL7jZs
Thank god for all the people on facebook posting what the temperature is or I would never know its cold outside #enough
This is probably the best shoutout I've ever seen #PITvsCHI #NHL
Can't wait for @Cinemax_Banshee tonight can we get a little Carrie, Burton and Job in this one? @mattyrauch @MisterHoonLee @ivanamilicevic
What a way for @TriesteKDunn to go. Your move @antonystarr #banshee @Cinemax_Banshee
Super Bowl is over and the leafs are terrible. What do I have to look forward to now? #connormcdavid?
Good call taking out reimer. Do him a favour and trade him @MapleLeafs #TMLtalk
I love the @Patriots and Brady but @Edelman11 was the MVP
Oh imagine that the @seahawk are being poor losers #idiots #classless
Hey @RSherman_25 That was #21 #idiot #stickthatinyourego
BOOM @Patriots #PatsNation
It is impossible to like the Seahawks. What is @RSherman_25 boasting about? You've been invisible this game #egomaniac
Winner? @sportsrage http://t.co/FRx3faIYZe
We may as well renew @Cinemax_Banshee for seasons 4-10 now @mattyrauch @Liliflower33 @antonystarr @ivanamilicevic @MisterHoonLee
Day off for super Sunday. Go pats #PatsNation #SuperBowl49 #NEvsSEA
In loving memory of Andrew Keating #BellLetsTaIk
I am seriously upset Nola is gone but you don't mess with Burton @Cinemax_Banshee @mattyrauch @OdetteAnnable
There is something more to this Robert Allenby story. #notbuyingit #halftruth
I guess we don't call holding on the offense anymore #NEvsIND
I think we all need a friend like a Burton on @BansheeTvShow
Didn't see that one coming #GBvsSEA
It's really easy to dislike the @Seahawks
I'm really laughing at those "experts" I saw on @tsn who have rated Russell Wilson ahead of Tom Brady of the four QB's remaining
I have to admit I love the way this game is going #GBvsSEA
I don't think I can pass up on @packers +8. Good move?
Nice run by Joe Dirt #DALvsGB
Maybe the coach should go join his brother in college @Ravens
Boom @Patriots what a game #PatsNation
BOOM @Patriots
Momentum has changed #PatsNation #NEvsBAL
BOOM @Edelman11
BOOM GRONK!!!! #PatsNation #NEvsBAL
I guess the refs bet on Baltimore @nfl #garbage #NEvsBAL
Is this the ref crew that did the Detroit Dallas game? #PatsVsRavens #PatsNation @nfl
What a terrible call. @NFL get your shit together
Nice return by @Edelman11 #PatsNation
Not sad to see Carlyle go. He never sold them on team defence and seemed to punish the young guys more than help them #TMLtalk #LeafsNation
Looking good on the bowl games so far. I know how this ends unless 2015 wants to be nicer to me
Rough day. Outdoor NHL game, NCAA bowl games, rum and coke. Happy new year to me
Really @NHL? Billy idol to kick off the outdoor game? Didn't see that one coming #whitewedding #CHIvsWAS
I really hope Rask and Bernier go in the third #TMLtalk #LeafsNation
Other than the players and their families, does anyone really care about the #SpenglerCup #myguessisno
A tremendous defensive battle is taking place at the Air Canada Center. #LeafsNation #TMLtalk
Remember when kickers used to make field goals? @Eagles
Congrats @NickPaul27 on making team Canada. You made North bay proud #WorldJuniors
$100 says the morons who threw their jerseys on the ice are hoping to get one for Christmas. #LeafsNation #gocheerforbuffalo
I like how every guy who sacks @JManziel2 has to do the money sign after. It's been done guys. Get creative
What gives #CamNewton the right to showboat? You are 4-8-1 superman. Congratulations loser. @Panthers
Had to work all day. Who cares? Home for the @Patriots game #PatsNation #NEvsSD
Remember when kickers used to make field goals? #NFL #MIAvsNYJ
Getting through the garbage until the Game of the Week #NEvsGB #PatriotsNation #BradyvsRodgers Pats by a touchdown
Well Marc trestman is getting fired @ChicagoBears #noheart
Big meeting of the minds at the Wall house today #wolfpack #minusone
Happy day off for the American #Thanksgiving. 9 hours of football, food, beer and gambling #BOOM #NFL
Sad to see what's going on in #Ferguson. Unless you were at the proceedings you don't have all the details remember that people
RIP Pat Quinn #LeafsNation
I don't know when the Cowboys signed Joe dirt but I'm glad he got that touchdown #DALvsNYG #beasley #nfl
This is more the Giants team I know
Nice shot of the VP kissing his 20 yr old girlfriend #cradlerobber #goodforyou
I've already heard more about @OBJ_3 catch than about anyone on the Jaguars over the last 3 years #nfl #unreal #playoftheyear
Looks like the Broncos field-goal kicker is going to get gang beaten by his teammates after the game #DENvsMIA #missedpoints
I loooove having @LKomarov back in a leafs jersey #TMLtalk #LeafsNation
I have been a diehard leaf fan for over 30 years and will never get to sit in the lower bowl @MapleLeafs #TMLtalk
