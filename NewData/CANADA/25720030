Air travel would be significantly less irritating if security expectations were the same at all airports. #inabin #notinabin
Head to the airport in four hours for a week long business trip &amp; suddenly I hate all my clothes &amp; just want to take a nap. #emptysuitcase
There is something very wrong about smart hockey guy like @FriedgeHNIC sharing air time with the likes of Stock and Kypreos. #sorryelliot
In all this @NHLJets playoff talk I would be curious to know how it impacts a professional sports guy like @pwilliamsNHL? Business as usual?
Burke get a haircut would be a pretty funny chant to hear at MTS. @MTSCentreChants @NHLJets
Family huddled around radio likes it's the 1950's. BRB going to put on my pearls &amp; heels before I make Big Red a drink. #thankssportsnet

Back in Winnipeg for first time in 2 years &amp; where do boys want to go? The @JetsGearStore, of course. #NHLJets http://t.co/9m90ylrGD3
Sitting in traffic gridlock on Kenaston. Don't ever change, Winnipeg. #welcomeback
Sometimes Twitter is just too full of horrible people for me to handle. Tonight is one of those nights. #signingoff
