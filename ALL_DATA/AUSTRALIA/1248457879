Move over Pizza, these are my new favourite flavour of @Pringles http://t.co/JRZ6iRYP6W
Just found out that @C4Countdown won't be broadcast in Australia on @SBS for a fortnight, which means I won't see it during the holidays ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
Richie Benaud died, so I bought @Wil_Anderson's DVD to cheer me up http://t.co/B4MVIOe5CZ
Billy Bragg and a Doug Anthony Allstar #omg #heaven @billybragg - @abcconvos with Richard Fidler http://t.co/ybDKsCdvrg
Is it me, or does @adamhillscomedy look like a member of @TheWiggles in this photo? http://t.co/lx0ZzO4OZ0
I'm watching reality TV but I'm not yelling at it, I'm wondering why I'm not on it. #gogglebox
Yep, @Johnny_Marr is the cool one '@GRACE4EVEREVER: Throwback to when Morrissey's Wikipedia page got edited. http://t.co/NTZT3EKEm9"
Well, Clarkson's been sacked by the Beeb, Top Gear might be axed, and we've all got an opinion, so here's mine: Take the show to @Join_Dave
#wmquestion my favourite spring activityâ€¦ would have to be staying inside and barricading the doors up so I don't suffer from hayfever. #WHY
How come @TheFootyShowAFL is the only Channel 9 program is can watch without attempting to smash my television into the wall.
I Probably shouldn't listen to @DAAS_Live  radio interviews before I go to sleep. I get excited when @RealTimFerguson  mentions my coasters
They've axed Bob the Builder and Postman Pat. IS THERE NOTHING SACRED IN THE WORLD!
Why are doorknobs such arrogant cunts #lookingformysanity
Watching the @neighbours 30th anniversary doco and OUTRAGED! by the fact they haven't mentioned the @DAAS_Live song 'Kylie and Jason'
The thing I like about Scunthorpe, is that it's probably not the only English town with the word Cunt in its name
Part 2 of 2 but after seeing what @Wil_Anderson did to the kid in the front row (mentioning wank socks 30 times) the back row was fine
Part 1 of 2. Would like to say that @Wil_Anderson's show was absolutely brilliant tonight. Would have loved to have been closer to the stage
The gr8 thing about doing Northern accents in drama is that it's an excuse to watch lots of @JohnBishop100 @JasonManford and @realrossnoble
Reason's it would suck to be @gdavies 
1. You would always bump your head when you went into the next room
Further proving Dr Who is crap "@Join_Dave: DAVE thought: http://t.co/hVhg3fR69t"
