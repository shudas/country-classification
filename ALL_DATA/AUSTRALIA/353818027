Idk why I'm listening to the most ratchet music while I'm trying to write my paper.
Srlys my chem prof needs to chill. He says he's being so hard on us because this is our last year at Uni. WRONG. I have another year left 😠

Whenever "All of Me" starts playing, I stop what I'm doing to admire the song because it's just so damn beautiful. 🙌🏼

Sometimes you learn more about a person being thousands of miles apart than you would with each other every single day.
