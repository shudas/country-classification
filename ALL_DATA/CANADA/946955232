THE WORLD NEEDS FEMINISM!!!
The only thing I can say is please educate yourself before opening your mouth to talk.
Saying you're not a feminist is like spitting in the faces of the women who fought for you to even be able to share your opinions!!!!
We should all be fucking feminists because no one wants to be judged based on biology.
So you don't believe in equality? Why don't you sit down then and be quiet like a good girl. Oh, you don't like that? #youreafeminist
Women who claim to not be feminists need to educate themselves..

That awkward moment when you wear your winter coat when it's 11 degrees because you haven't been outside all day....
As a future teacher, I swear to never assign group projects that require students to meet outside of school time.
I predict a mental breakdown before 4..
Theres a difference between being a bitch and a boss, I just happen to be both.
