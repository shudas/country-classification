Now I gotta keep it on the low with my name in class or else this guy will be looking at me like 😒 then again I can just explain to him...
Full did some shifties and realized I copied his work posted after mine instead of copying my own work.
Then he was like "so some one called Evelyn just copied my work". I was like 😐😐😐
The person was sitting right behind me too.
So I accidentally copied and pasted someone's work at uni today 😂😂

Wisdom tooth is growing 😩

To the person that gave the freshie my number without even asking me? Shame be unto you. People get murdered because of this.
Let's just say I've blocked I'm in any kind of way he thinks he can contact me...
And he has the audacity to tell me he wants to marry me and I should keep myself for him. Like wth?
So some guy from Ghana got my Australian number from God knows who 😒
Note to fresh boys: DON'T TELL A GIRL YOU LIKE HER THE FIRST DAY YOU SEE HER. It's a big turn off uno.
