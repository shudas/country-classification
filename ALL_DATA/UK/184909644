Tight game at 2-1. #NYRangers need to find the intensity they had in the 1st. Find that and the win should come. #NYR #LGR
#NYRvsPIT
A perfect 1st period by the #NYRangers. Play the game our way! #BornWinners #StanleyCupPlayoffs
Second round, enjoy the golf #Pens fans/players.  https://t.co/ktO7qnG7MP
Yup you could be correct, but it won't be against the Penguins that's for sure! https://t.co/zXlI4jZVGF

#Pens are rattled and I love it! #NYRvsPIT
28 seconds! That's how you start the #Playoffs2015 baby!!! #NYR #NYRvsPIT
Even more than usual, the Garden is looking beautiful tonight! #Playoffs2015 #MSG

Great to see @TigerWoods back playing competitive golf. Still believe there's at least 1 Major in him. If not he's still a joy to watch.
Big weekend of sport;

#Caps @ #Sabres has been a surprisingly good game so far. Only mid 1st period but Buffalo lead 2-1. Hope they keep it up!!
Massive couple of minutes coming up for the #NYRangers. As much as I hate the caps you've gotta respect the PP. 5on3 is not good!

Finally Dion does something worthwhile.

Can't wait for an evening full of #NHL action. Face-off times are set up perfectly to be watching in the UK/Europe!
Too hot to Yandle. Love it!!!

This could be a massive turning point for the @NHLFlames, hopefully not though! #BigLoss

Love #DeadlineDay around the #NHL. With so much happening, a team can go from playoff outsiders to #StanleyCup contenders.
On the fence tonight. Two of my favorite #NHL teams facing off against each other. Never an easy watch!
#CGYvsNYR
Standard @FifeFlyers üòû
As a #Flames fan I don't want either of these teams winning. #LAKvsSJS 
Guess as long as it doesn't go to overtime I'll accept who wins üòõ

Almost time for the #StadiumSeries game to face off. Hopefully live up to expectations.

Better be a fight a some stage during this game! #TMLvsWPJ #HNIC
#Toronto are up #SchittsCreek without a paddle. #CBC
#TMLeafs are probably the biggest farce in the #NHL this season. Looking at their roster they have no excuse to be 26th in the league.
#NYRangers @ #TMLeafs tonight
Time to get back to winning ways against, by far, the worst performing #OriginalSix team this season. #NHL
Gutted but I'll take the point. Can't afford to show up for 1 period and expect to win games. #NYR #NYRvsDAL

Sigh üòî #NYR
"Save" is the most used word used by all commentators during this 1st period. #NYIvsNYR #MSG
End to end hockey!!! #NYIvsNYR
This is going to be a real tester for the #NYRangers. 
#LGR #NYIvsNYR
Rooting for #TeamToews because;
1. Nash plays for #TeamToews 
2. Ovi playing for #TeamFoligno
The #NHLAllStar weekend is always farcical but worth a watch nonetheless.
Love a #NYRangers win!!
A GOAL!!! Never thought I was going to see one tonight. #NYR 1-0 #Sens 
#NYRvsOTT
A slow burner but the #NYRangers offensive game is growing into the game. #NYRvsOTT
Pathetic policing/security here at Ibrox. Why did they let both sets of fans out at the same time? @RangersFC @JamTarts #RFCvHFC
Not sure why #LiverpoolFC never made an approach for @Torres last summer. #StillGotIt
Just noticed there's Spanish #CopaDelRey football on. 45mins of entertaining football coming up üëç #RMAvsATL #MadridDerby
Leafs are on a downwards spiral and it's getting out of control. Love it haha!!!

Can see the #Capitals running away with this. #Hawks look terrible throughout the 1st 13 minutes. #WinterClasic #NHL
Can't beat watching the #NHL #WinterClasic on New Year's Day. Should be fun for all.
‚Ä¶and the streak continues üéâ
Merry Christmas #RangersTown
Nash with a hat trick??? #NYR
5 on 3. Sweeeet! C'mon boys.
#NYR #LGR
Massive power play coming up. These guys are gassed and I fear the #Capitals still have another goal in them. C'mon #NYRangers!!!
#NYRvsWAS
#NYRangers are making hard work of this. Cruised the 1st and 2nd but this 3rd period has been shocking! Finger out guys!
#NYR #LGR #NYRvsWAS
God dam it! Lucky #Capitals 
#NYRvsWAS
Nash's season is going from strength to strength. 2nd of the night and now 3-0 #NYRangers!!!
Girardi has Ovi in his back pocket. Too good, too funny!!! #NYR #LGR
Our PP is back and makes it 2-0!
#NYR #NYRvsWAS
Ovi is spitting feathers hahahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ
#NYRvsWAS
Can't stand Ovechkin. Absolute prick of a hockey player. #Capitals #NYRvsWAS
What a great hockey play, opened them right up! #NYRvsWAS 1-0üö®
Lets go #NYRangers!!!
Keep this streak running and get one over these overrated #Capitals.
#NYRvsWAS
Winning streak now extended to 6 games. Hopefully another on Tuesday to make it 7 for Christmas. #NYR #LGR #MSG
Could do with an early goal in the 3rd to keep the nerves away. #NYRangers
Can't believe it's still only 1-0 in favor of the #NYRangers. Hope these missed opportunities don't come back on us! #MSG
Quick whistles do my head in. What ever happened to the 3 second ruling?

Where did @FifeFlyers win come from last night?!? More of the same tonight please. #COYF
Love it when #MUFC beat #LFC. Another 3 points and now 6 straight wins.
#EPL #MUFCvLFC
What a finish Rooney! Beautiful wing play at perfect pass. 1-0 UNITED!
#MUFC
Personally I think Ally McCoist has made the right decision leaving @RangersFC.
Will always be a #RFC legend though!
It's a tad slippery out there tonight. Love winter when there's snow and ice.

Another win for #ManUtd and what's more important is it was away from Old Trafford. Up to 3rd with a massive game next Sunday #MNUvsLFC
Never a dull moment in Liverpool. Helicopter flying over head‚Ä¶ at least it's quiet one üòè
Has the @DetroitRedWings not been paying their bills? #VANvsDET
Happy #StAndrewsDay all.
Great win for @ManUtd and even bigger 3 points. Just need to keep the momentum.

Real classy @FitzyG13, easily seen you play for @Finner16. #Gutless
