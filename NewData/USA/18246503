Of course, my major actor crush is Harvey Keitel. In Bad Lieutenant.
Of all the Daredevil dudes, Wilson Fisk is the only one I find attractive. I wouldn't have him hold a car door for me, though.
Watching Daredevil, our guest @Alise_Gluskova mutters "Of course" each time a bad guy is Russian. She then critiques their accents. ;)
Theda Alene Weatherford - Blue Mountain Eagle @HackinTimSeeley @indycred @ScottAllie Oh my god! http://t.co/TEbGMhqfv9
Yow. It takes 1,799 gallons of water to produce 1lb beef &amp; what you can do about the CA drought. @ZeroWasteChef http://t.co/QPTBooMbWD
There is a Buckman dad here with a beard, wearing flip-flops, hair in a man bun, in a hoodie. He is Ur-Portland!
Happy Monday! Links (and Videos) to Make Your Day Brighter http://t.co/uEER0hoJ0M
Writing really is like fermentation. Letting some ideas sit out to see what bubbles; carefully feeding what does, throwing out the waste!

Things @ScottAllie says to me almost every day: "You're a monster."

It's true: awesome potato pancakes, baked goods, pastrami hash, yum! https://t.co/ytiQiQCcAb
In other reduced-garbage news, psyched @peoplescooppdx has bulk dishwasher powder. Refilled my Cascade box, ha. #ZeroWaste
Dilled egg salad for breakfast is where it's at! Made it out of leftover deviled eggs. #ZeroWaste
Superbaby! http://t.co/RNEw7U8AgM
Sarah's second food: applesauce. So far, not liking it much more than zucchini! Guess I used some tart apples. #nosugar
Ha ha ha! Really, I should make fish en papillote for a #TwinPeaksDinner. Ha! http://t.co/n6eJgsWnz5
Maturity is passing on breakfast brie and realizing there's some egg salad that needs to be finished first. #choices
Title of the book I'll write about Sarah: "Why You Hit Mommy in the Face?" Hers for me: "Why You Wipe My Nose?"
Ugh. So, Uncanny X-Men is the BEST. How many more sleeps, @BRIANMBENDIS? (That was a "thank you for making me cry" ugh.)
So a bunch of drunk assholes are setting things on fire behind my house &amp; the police won't do anything until my shed or house catches fire.
Passed out at Passover. http://t.co/CqolMSNBAy
What a macaroon! http://t.co/JIjZY6Kevg
Also I think she just gave me a hug for the first time. But she could have been reaching for my hair. Ah, got it.
Also: argh, I need coconut! How fast can  I get her in the car?
I must say, Sarah is an agreeable baby. I just had to wake her up from her nap--almost two hours! Long way away from her 30 min ones.
Daddy's girl. http://t.co/ETjmft3mz9
At @blockspdx for the first time, sampling goodies. The banana bread and breakfast cookies are SO GOOD. And the rugelach! Yummmm.
