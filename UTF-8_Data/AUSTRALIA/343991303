I can NOT deal with people making up rumours. I've done plenty wrong that I'm happy to admit to already, there's no need to be a fantasist 👉
Treated myself today 😍 http://t.co/9OspInhatq
Just seen a contender for the UKs number 1 most hypocritical tweet of 2015

#MortgageBrokerIssues
2 pissed off clients, 2 pissed off solicitors and a pissed off management company but I still think I'm more pissed off than them all added
There is no way I even know 374 people 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Deleted 374 people off Facebook this morning 😂
If you and your partner met in 2013, split in 2014, got with other people then got back together in 2015 you HAVE NOT been together 2 years
Got snapchat again, add meeee: charlsemma
Story of our lives last night @georgiamae_xx 😂 http://t.co/PPQmvpDF0m

Seriously contemplating driving to @megaanleane's work to try convince her to come out
Wish @megaanleane would do as she's told.. 😏
I wana go out so badly but 9am client meeting and being ill is a fairly decent reason to get tucked up and have an early one
This had best be a joke http://t.co/jRcrO1dIE1
Why do I keep using hashtags, they're horrible 😩 ########
Just bought @petebishop1993 a birthday present.. Still got almost 2 months to get the rest sorted #prepared
£22.50 for 2 full sets and an extra pair of knickers from Ann Summers, bargain😻👏
Mafia with Trev again 📺
Alexander McQueen exhibition at the V&amp;A museum 😍😫 want to see it all again http://t.co/44RbolGBJO
Family friend owns some 1998 McQueen.. Might have to get closer
So many girls trying to act like their boyfriend doesn't control them that they forget how to be a decent girlfriend
Just because your boobs are huge DOES NOT mean they are nice #sagging
Fave compliment 👏 http://t.co/CLa8lQqYpi
Just let the sales lady at Halifax talk me into getting a large overdraft
Not sure 19 constitutes for a child anymore but compared to 40...
As if my client just told me he can't tell me what he was doing when thinking about me this morning.. YOUR 40 I AM A CHILD NOOOOOO
Alexander McQueen exhibition at V&amp;A is amazing, 100% recommend it if you can get tickets
Convinced @petebishop1993 to take me to the Maldives in September 😍👏
So excited to be going to the Alexander McQueen Savage Beauty exhibition tomorrow
I am all over the Mac X Philip Treacy and Giambattista Valli collections 😍😩 http://t.co/TS9KqhyVdg
who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell... You know you love me XOXO
My baby passed it's MOT with no advisories 😄👏
I love that I have the kind of relationship where we are just as likely to book a holiday to Ibiza together as we are to book the Maldives
The mafia is on @TomBarkley96 !
Firm believer that when a relationship ends it should stay private. Your reasons are your own and nobody needs their dirty laundry aired.
Most childish break up of the century 😩🙅
A lot has changed but your still my best friend! Love you @bethcrozierr x x x http://t.co/1ex7AROk9Z
Shameless birthday selfies in @ALMAU_eu xxxx http://t.co/3VcKaazUQ8

Halifax paying me £125 to switch my bank account to them when I was going to do it anyway.. Thanks 💁
60 days from now is 50% through Petes deployment.. 😩 SOMEONE TELL ME THIS GETS EASIER
Crushed ice lemon water is the most refreshing thing 😍

Sometimes I hate my own thoughts
Everyone's always in such a rush, like calm down your ruining life
I reallllyyyyyy want to go out tonight 😩
Just finished work at I started at at 8:30am.. Hard work had better pay off
Like how did you even get in my house? How long have you been here? Who do you belong to?
Just sat minding my own business and I look up to find an unknown cat in my house eating my lunch on the floor in front of me
Fuck it, at least I have a back up pair..
How have I ended up buying 2 pairs of the same shoes in a week when I've been searching for them for 2 months😩
Sold some items on depop and made £110 in 3 hours.. Not bad
That's some serious year 8 antics
If a couple have been together less than 6 months and they're publicly declaring how much they love each other, I can't take it seriously
Couldn't even wait 12 days http://t.co/tIuoiEvZND
My girls aren't even prepared for how many pictures I'm going to make them take on my birthday @megaanleane @georgiamae_xx @georgiepollockx

Want this? I'm selling it on @depopmarket 💸 http://t.co/4iq2Mvo0TI
So thankful that I met my life partner so young, it gives us more time to grow together and build a future
Get so impatient when I see really successful people then I realise I'll be in that position before I even reach their age..
I can't wait to see what Pete gets me for my late valentines/birthday &amp; waiting present when he's home, that boy doesn't do half measures 😍
Counting down the days until he's home 😩❤️ http://t.co/BvAnSsVpJY

Me and @georgiamae_xx text 24/7 and ALWAYS about makeup or clothes or having a moan 😂
Got paid at 3:30 and I have £15 to my name now
I wana go out tonight but a foot injury and 2 mortgage applications are telling me not to
Anyone who knows me knows I break my phone every 6 weeks so I've bought an indestructible phone case for my business line
Got my stepdad a little present 🎁 http://t.co/n1kVce7ByN
Counting down the days to a pornstar martini
I'm really annoyed that in 2015 people still hold views like this #FarageFansAndUKIPLovers
Genuinely concerned that there isn't a political party I feel comfortable enough to vote for
"All Cosmetic surgery should be on the NHS" you're a fucking idiot love
Who is this fucking dick head on Farage Fans &amp; Ukip Lovers!!!!!!
I miss my boyfriend 😭💌🇬🇧✈️📝 http://t.co/k80aIfHxtc
Can't believe I've fractured my foot I'm such a dickhead
Maintaining the balance between friendly and professional is something I clearly need to work on, second client to ask me out now😩
