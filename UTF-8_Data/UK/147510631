Lovely debate rounded off with a GROUP HUG.

This is what progression looks like, people! #BBCDebate
I imagine this is how Miliband flirts with girls #BBCDebate
ITS NOT BECAUSE OF THE IMMIGRANTS NIGEL YOU CUNT #BBCDebate
Nat Ben is also doing great &amp; Leanne #BBCDebate
I think #NicolaSturgeon is winning tonight's #GE2015 debate #SkyNewsPoll What do you think? http://t.co/6FEvqgCrc3
I think Nigel must realise he's stupid if Ed Miliband is laughing at him #BBCDebate
Trident is about as necessary as Nigel Farrage is relevant. #BBCDebate
Nicola getting laughs, cheers and Nigel Farrage flustered. Marry me #BBCDebate
If Miliband wants we at home to be the judge he'll definitely be in the bottom two.

#BBCDebate
Let's take a moment to appreciate this 3-2 gender balance.
Progression is happening, guys! #BBCDebate @AngrySalmond @StormySturgeon @theSNP
I've never had a fight but if I do I want Nicola S by my side #BBCDebate
Punching the microphone, classic Miliband #BBCDebate
HELL YES! #BBCDebate
Sturgeon'll shank yer ass, pal #BBCDebate
Miliband saying "Charlotte you are right" is the politician version of "I hear ya sista" #BBCDebate
"I'll always put working families first"

Yeah, first on the list of who to tax #bbcdebate
Natalie Bennett is good and I like her Potter-esque necklace #bbcdebate
"Only UKIP is prepared to talk straight"

Which befits your member's quote "telling us homosexuality is normal when it's not" #BBCDebate
If I write an autobiography I want Leanne Wood to do the audiobook #BBCDebate
Hope Nic Sturgeon wears her tartan stilettos tonight #BBCDebate
I need someobody who can beatbox for a thing I'm doing in August so if you know anybody who can offer their talent hook us up, babe.
Can't believe @TravelodgeUK think their rooms are worth Â£150 a night. Wow.
Edinburgh Fringe planning! http://t.co/vgVppjFYzh
Not long now, @ThePleasance and @Gildedballoon! Looking forward to seeing these buildings Fringe-ed up sooooon ðŸ˜¸ðŸ˜† http://t.co/rq7oObIUCu
This is really good. http://t.co/rFImHWpOvE
Think I've got concussion from playing Hide'n'Seek.
Off down to Beattock &amp; Moffat over the next couple of days and Edinburgh on Thursday; lovely!
These are brilliant parents. #TransgenderKids
I wish I had Louis Theroux's job although my ambition would be dampened in knowing I'd never be as flawless as him.
Guys! Louis Theroux on BBC2 now! Go!
Contrails from the 747, FRA to YVR! http://t.co/Xry5HNpOZn
Ironic that UKIP are promoting an 'Australian Style' points system.

Damn Australians, coming over here taking our points systems. #GE2015
The real winner tonight is... democracy.

In as much as we have reached the democratic verdict that Nigel Farage is a cunt. #leadersdebate
Yay!
Farage is wanking behind the podium at the mere mention of immigration #leadersdebate
What makes me especially happy is that I'm pretty sure Nicola will be wearing her tartan stilettos behind the podium #leadersdebate
Ed Miliband seems really proud of his broad shoulders metaphor. #leadersdebate
I wish I was Nicola Sturgeon. #leadersdebate
Goin be to 4 country different summer in holiday!Â¡'
Martha Stewart is melting under the stage lights. #BieberRoast
I think the main thing that needs to be reaffirmed in #GE2015 is that the party leaders care about their policies not just being a winner.

Meatloaf Live With the MSO is an incredible show. Amazing.
HIGHER BUS MAN, this is quite helpful if you can translate the SQA talk http://t.co/7xm7iVVvrU
Can't recommend the @ninaconti @GiveaGiggle documentary enough; funny and relevant and poignant and just perfect. So, so good.

Heartily recommend the @TomCraine Story Show Podcast- really, really good.
@Xfm
Alone in McDonald's last night and a lady fell asleep in her Chicken Legend. I'm mixing with high circles.
Hearing @brendonburns &amp; his son drive through the Outback is beautiful &amp; funny &amp; cringeworthy in equal measure. Such a good podcast.
