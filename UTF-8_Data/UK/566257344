I honestly couldn't hate college more at the moment
Niamh's a bellend 😭😭
Anyone got McDonald's monopoly green Bond Street help a brutha out
I am well bored
It's so hot and I'm so pale that I'll probably get a sunburn from the rays coming through the fucking bus window
Very undecided 🙇🏻
Why did I even quit my old job 😭
Just because u have a boyfriend doesn't mean ur are not ur own person anymore 😅 goodness
Can I justify moving 4 hours and 54 minutes away to go to uni? Hmmmm
My Zara order is at the store but I have to wait until tomorrow to get it 😩 sighhhh
Blehhhhh 😷😩
Did my stomach actually just growl that loudly that my whole English class heard.. Yes, yes it did.
Have we actually got to go back to college tomorrow or is it some sort of sick joke
You know when you've had money and you've spent it all and you have nothing to show for it whatsoever

Yeah

That
Honestly I feel sad and disappointed in myself for not revising but at the same time I don't have the effort to do it today so life sucks
Never leave all your college/sixth form work until the last day of the holidays 😩 oh and revise 😳😳😣
I actually left all of my college work until the day we go back. Good one Sophie
Sick one 😒

renting a film from iTunes was a complete and utter waste of money. my own fault for thinking it expired in 29 days instead of 2 days.

I couldn't be more in love with Eric in That 70's Show 😩😩😩

Resulting to 46p tortilla chips instead of Doritos because that extra £1 somet means something to you when you have no job
Why can't I find a job that pays like £10 an hour and that I absolutely love

Film lessons can actually be kind of boring when you have no friends 😭😭😭😭
My bus has come early and I missed it, I knew it 😧😒😳😩😩😩😓

Been with Jamie for 4 months today and every day I think that he could not be more annoying, and then he proves me wrong 😊
I don't think I'd be happy with the Fantastic Four remake if Miles Teller wasn't playing Reed
Finally rang the tax office 😩 I am gonna be rolling in it
My Easter holiday will be spent watching the however many seasons there are of PLL
OH MY GOD!?!? #Hollyoaks
I've left my memory stick at college for the second day in a row. Looking at the positive side, I have an excuse for not doing any work.
If the bus that was supposed to be here at 7 minutes past doesn't come at 17 minutes past then ... Well I'll just continue to be impatient.
RIP Lil' Chris, your music was my childhood 😩😩😩
Idk why I even chose media when I dread the Monday hour and a half lessons
