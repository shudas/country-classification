Today with @claireofsummer_ was good
A good day turned to shit pretty quickly
I wish you'd be proud of me. But you're not.
Can't stop listening to Sexism
I really need to get out today, I feel like shit and I will go insane if I stay in. :/
SOMEONE MEET ME TODAY OMG
Someone meet me?
I'm so proud of @BornFrom_ADream
I'm so ew
You damn right know that there was something up and you just plain ignore it half the time. Ugh!
It's the same for dogs, idk how people could hurt them
I love Cats too much, I mean how could someone hurt a precious little fluffy thing
Where the hell did this headache come from? Holy crap I can't even stand up without wanting to sit back down. Fuck
Me + makeup = nah http://t.co/FnUGkEclOe
That really relieved that awful urge.
So 2013 arched eyebrows Caitlin is back. H e l l o
Remember that time in Oldmachar where there was a random dog running about the English huts and everyone was just cuddling it?
Every Monday I feel like shit and idek why
WOW WAY TO GO TWITTER, JUST PUT A LYRIC IN THE WRONG PLACE. DICK.
The damage done is far beyond repair
I've sung my last song today
Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I know, no one said it's fair
And after all this time I thought we'd just grow old
I never meant to hurt the ones who cared
I never ment to leave this world alone
But now, i'm hoping someones there
I never put my faith in up above
Never thought I'd lie in my own blood
Now I find myself in my own blood
Wow, I hate myself.
I push cake into my mouuuuth, it's the only thing that slowly stops the paaaiin
Why is it as soon as I mention the fact that I feel like shit, EVERYONE fucks off.
I'm in such a dubsteppy mood.
