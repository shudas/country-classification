Focus on the better
It's almost that time
So many people lack basic respect
Actually wanted to see you tonight..
I'm coming for everything they said I couldn't have

Long showers, loud music, deep thoughts.
Everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was
My problem is that I don't appreciate what I have that's in front of me
My life is fucked
Back massage would be perfect
In need of something to relive this stress off me
I always have late timing.. WHY IS THAT😒😔
Every mark, every scar, tells the story of who you are.
Change today, so tomorrow won't be the same
#whoisxman
More money, more problems.
I want you to want me
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I mean, you know where to find me
Niggas be hurt too.. But you never gonna hear him admit it, you'll just see him with a bunch of different hoes. Trynna hide the pain
#GOTTTI
I'm here for a reason
It makes me smile, cause I got it
I hope you like it..
Damn, it's getting intense
I've lost friends in the process of figuring myself out. Always stay real even when they ain't.
This is something brand new, huh?
"Congratulations, you just F'd around the room" 😂😂 #hasty
That still makes me wonder..
😒
She gave me brain, she a mastermind to be exact
I need better songs..
Tour bus like a National Geographic

Easily irritated.

Almost home
You goddamn right I watched #Furious7 once again last night. 😂
Man, lemme go back to sleep. Already in a bad mood. Long ass ride back.
Why in the fuck would you take a selfie right after you just got in a wreck? Swear people on my snapchat story is something else
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a new whip, I cause a scene.
Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too

Girl. Keep shitting on all these hoes. Don't let another nigga get too close
Don't get me wrong
Don't want you think the wrong thing.
Going back to ATL again. Hit up the mall
My body's calling for you
It's so rare to find loyalty.
You sound asleep 😂
Now I can't sleep, lol
That was really unexpected, but I love it💕
I just needed my babe to make it even better
My night http://t.co/XDMiZBldFX
Haven't skated in forever
Here. We. Go.
My life is so confusing sometimes
Damn, you gotta put me on the spot, right now?😅😓
Deep conversations and natural connections
I just want you to witness it
Views are perfect
See if I can be on the set of ATL 2. 😂😂
Bout to hit up downtown Atlanta.
You know what I came to do
Can we just leave already?
They playing the same shit

Nigga plays the trashiest songs ever

Deciding if I should start dancing and kill the whole floor or not....

This is getting really uncomfortable for me...
On my R. Kelly shit, rn. 😂😂
Tell me, what's your desire, baby your wish
Is my will
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play
Cause your body's calling me And with your permission let me start your ignition
Nothing's been said yet
I wanna go on the beach right about now
You don't even know
Then it just changes. Like that
😒
Oh, please no.
