In looking for a recipe for a birthday dessert I just Googled: Asian cream pie #RecipeFail
I so wish I could spend that much time in the bathroom each morning.  Or even have that much alone time. #ThugLife
Just got my hair tangled in my bra clasp. Either time for a no bra policy or a haircut.
Looking for a new career...maybe I could review something. Not sure what. Suggestions @skinnepa?
Told my Husband that I was going to say I was a Trophy Wife instead of a SAHM. 
He snickered.
So rich widow it is.
Husband's who sleep past 9:30 DO NOT get Valentines Day morning BJ's. #RulesAreRules
