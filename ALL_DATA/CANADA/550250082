One last thing thing: @RickStrankman is a damn good man. He's better, braver and more principled than the very best of his detractors.
People who wouldn't vote WRP anyways are mad about pies. I'm done giving a shit about something so stupid.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, already.
Right now on the #abvote feed: Pies are tools of patriarchy and other reasons there has to be a comet hurdling toward us to wipe us all out.
I guess not everyone likes pie. Politics over pie? Stupid.
Desperation with a side helping of insult to our intelligence. That's all this piegate crap is about. Also. I'm gonna bake a pie, now.

Hockey fights on my twitter.
Oh... The last laugh? It's delicious. Like the last ice cream sandwich, eaten out of spite.
Remember that time they pronounced #WRP dead at the hands of Danielle Smith? Bahahahahah &lt;-------That's us, having the last laugh.
See. This guy gets it  https://t.co/U66kBPoCt0

There's a lot of "One guy said something bigoted so you're all bigots" happening right now. And *that's* an entirely bigoted attitude. #wrp

No even close to the point I was making. But unsurprisingly,  he missed it.   https://t.co/UkQVOkNwnp
