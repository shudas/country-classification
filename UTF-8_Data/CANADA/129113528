And then I let out a big ass loud fart in the middle of svasana. Still living your fitness nightmares so you don't have to.
My legs are covered in sick workout bruises. #fitness #legs https://t.co/N8XcMkH2I1
Years of being an awkward freak have taught me the art of looking like I don't give a f@#! while feeling so mortified I want to die.
My pants fell down in TRX class today. Yep. I'm living the fitness nightmares so you don't have to.
I just discovered that our school gym has a climbing wall! Now I need to find out when and how I can get in on this.
Having some good life choices for breakfast this morning. Oatmeal, yogurt and an apple. #oatmeal… https://t.co/W38BYh7JtM
Tonight's #VoiccesAfterDark "Sarah,  how's you vagi- uhhh"  "umm... Adequately stuffed?" she meant to ask about my veggie lasagna.
It was an honour to be recognized at @voicesmyicn Youth Champion Dinner. Thank you so much! *tear tear*
Reminder to self: Reading the @MyFitnessPal forums is not the same as studying for my nutrition exam.
Being sick blows, but I suppose the new season of Trailer Park Boys makes it suck a little bit less.
I don't want to be sick!!!! I want to go to Yuri's Night!
Let's be real here...  I'm not going to get any skinner laying in bed all day drinking ginger ale. I need to work out.
I dunno. Maybe a day off to be sick would be justified if I didn't have 3 exams to study for, a sink full of dishes and no clean socks.
Sweet. Now I can go to the gym or yoga or even get out of bed without having to get a lecture about overdoing it.
Had a blast at Tabletop Day @SkullSpaceWpg today!

I swear to god I'm gonna bitch slap the next person who giggles that a logic exam should be easy because you just give the logical answer.
Sarah vs Math round 1. The scorekeeper has determined that I am victorious this round.
Got my fingers crossed, my pencil sharpened and the quadratic formula memorized. Time to go pass math!
Kind of taken aback and feeling kind of mushy inside because C remembered that I drink mint tea before exams.
On the Playlist to my math exam: I'll Make A Man Out Of You, Imperial March, Eye Of The Tiger.
Omg screaming baby on the bus. It's 10 pm. I've been working out and studying all day. I literally can't even.
Ugh. My brain is so fried. Screw everything.
Dear Subway: why is it when I ask for extra spinach and a couple jalapeños, I get 4 spinach leaves and 10 jalapeño peppers?

30 days of yoga day 6: I can do a full plank in my vinyassas now! Also, meditation has me super chill.
C was up late last night. He made me breakfast while I slept. #breakfast https://t.co/DhLHE9JH4H
I love getting up early at C's place. It involves his mom showing me pictures and telling me stories of his childhood. It's great.
30 days of yoga day 3: It took all I had to get there, but I'm glad I finally went. I can actually plank now!
I mathed all by myself! Woo! Gearing up for me vs math: round 1 on Tuesday with @BryanPenfound http://t.co/QylqRes3ZE
*Sigh* One last heated debate in Logic. Damn I'm gonna miss this class! *cues Vitamin C*
And then I missed the bus. This day sucks.
Fucking really? Back tire is flat again. Ffs.
My tire is finally holding air! Woo! I can finally ride my bike! Cue the Queen!

It's a rare occasion where I get stuck at a table where the people I am with are more inappropriate than me. Fuck that. I have beer at home.
The snow is not even off the ground and I'm already covered in hives from an allergic reaction that can't be identified. Awesome.
Last programming class of the year! Woo! Now to study hard for the exam!
I got my official offer letter today... For the summer I am a systems analyst! It's a real job! It's a sweet job! I am so stoked!
.@MarieinPegcity I needed to be reminded that even if I slip and fall, I'll never go back to where I once was, that place is now gone.
Thank you @MarieinPegcity for an uplifting, much needed talk of encouragement and progress.
And listening to my prof pick on Gwyneth Paltrow which is pretty great.
Discussing fat phobia in class today.
Oh god I hope there's room to lay down in the nap room soon.
I'm writing a test on quantification theory today. This makes me feel smart.
I have a test at 8:30 am. My body has decided that I need to stay awake doing stuff right now.
Love makes you stupid.
Ugh. I need to get away from my place for a bit, but do I need to get out of there as bad as I need to avoid my boyfriend's family?

Only I can possibly get a sugar hangover so bad I have to leave school.

I seriously want to start bitch slapping people.
I keep going to class hoping this will be the class it all clicks and it just doesn't. It just gets worse.
Awesome. So I have failing another quiz to look forward to. Is it almost over yet?
Totally made my day when @MarieinPegcity said I was looking good! Thanks girl!
Debating... Upper, lower or core today? #gymproblems
So it turns out that my sister stresses me out more than my math class does. Wow.

My Java prof just initialized a double d. Naturally, I burst out laughing.
Wow. The one quiz I thought I actually did well on I failed miserably. Awesome. Seriously. Why do I bother?
Some days I think I want to switch direction completely and go into nutritional science and food chemistry.
My nutrition prof just ruined alcohol... And then saved it?
Maybe with as jaded and frustrated I feel with school, I need to sit and think about why I am doing this.
A moody Facebook status turned into a whack of people telling me not to settle for my BF. What the actual fuck?
