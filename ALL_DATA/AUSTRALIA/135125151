Oh, and thanks #ABC730 for the Silvana Nero nightmares I'm about to have. I mean it from the heart of my bottom.

After Barangaroo, it seems to me that it's Nile who doesn't "believe in" anything. #Atheist has nothing on him.
Nile: I'm so ordinary. The rest of you are all wrong. #ABC730 #nswpol
WTF does "believe in" even mean, anyway? #ABC730 #nswpol

Gaah! Channel-surfing to find bloody Kate Upton on Channel 10 advertising that friggin' game!

*checks PVR for cooking show recordings*
Some bastard has locked their dog in a car in the Penrith Council car park. Police dealing with it fortunately.
You mean the meme generator might still have been up?
Letter. Of. The. Day.

Brilliant. http://t.co/DMUF0G0OXW
Alright, alright. I'm out.
A marketing campaign to end all marketing campaigns.
#FreshInOurMemories
So that was Tuesday, then. Not a bad effort, that.
End of this ep of Anzac Girls is cracking me up in light of the Woolworths #FreshInOurMemories kerfuffle.
This fail is going to stay #FreshInOurMemories for quite some time, I think.
Next time, @Woolworths_AU, ponder just a wee bit more deeply the question, "what could possibly go wrong?" #FreshInOurMemories
I wish they'd at least let the Gosford Anglican Church have their turn with it. #FreshInOurMemories
.@woolworths_au Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. #FreshInOurMemories
It's not every day you see a major company put a kick-me sign on its own back and take a long walk through cyberspace. #FreshInOurMemories
Why did it take them so long to take the #FreshInOurMemories image generator down?

TFW looking at Bill Shorten and both despairing of and fearing the end of the Abbott government.
Oh, FFS. do these wing nuts have any actual, you know, evidence of Halal certification funding outlawed organisations? #LateLine #auspol
Nice display of social conscience there, Alannah. How about more of the same on asylum seekers and privacy? #QandA
We're happy to spend oodles of money making enemies in the Middle East, but nothing to support indigenous communities. #QandA
Ultimately, however, being invaded by the British and having the place declared Terra Nullius was an unfortunate lifestyle choice. #QandA
TFW criticism of Islam in particular looks like a proxy for racism. #QandA
If Daesh is representative of Islam, then the KKK and WBC are representative of Christianity. #QandA
Labor was chasing the votes of people who will never vote for them when they supported #DataRetention. #QandA
Labor, you are SO WRONG on data retention. #QandA
Hey, Labor. If you guys change your mind on #DataRetention and #AsylumSeekers, you'll pick up a lot of votes and crowd the Greens. #QandA
What we really need protection from is a nosey-parker government obsessed with secrecy. #QandA
Instead of looking at journos' metadata to see who spoke to them, you monitor everyone else to see who's speaking to the journo. #QandA
Seriously, #auspol, why can't the government just get a warrant and start recording then? #QandA
Better still, why do we deserve to have metadata retention laws imposed upon us at all? #QandA
Rugby League doing its best to push me away. That's a penalty every day of the week. A really bad miss by the refs. #nrlsouthscowboys
Maybe instead of a (poorly targeted) financial penalty, perhaps denial of access to relevant public services? #AntiVaxx #auspol
31 now? FFS, what is it going to take to stop #VAW? #ABC730
Good demolition job there, Daesh. Arsehats. #SBSNews
Choosing to rely on herd immunity seems selfish: "you all have to get vaccinated so that I don't have to."
Oh. It is, I see. We're just arguing about the shape.
I didnt realise the Laffer Curve was still a thing.
Already with the leaks, #GameOfThrones? I'm still waiting for an opportunity to get into S2.
So I experimented with recording a simple riff with 4 pan settings in GB/Jamup. Wow. Now I just need to learn how to play.
Not enough, @billshortenmp. Only exemptions should be from independent doctors for medical reasons. Cc: @Peter_Fitz http://t.co/nW5PsUkA9P
FFS, Game Of War. DIAF already.

Digital rape and digital murder on the digital high digital seas. I guess that's what they mean by digital piracy. Arsehats.
OIC. There was Divergent before this one. No wonder I felt like I was missing a lot of back-story.
About to see Insurgent. In a real cinema, on a real ticket paid for with real money.
When they've broken every other promise, why should this one be a problem? #auspol http://t.co/lwxykx26fq
Getting a wee bit sick of ads for whatever bloody game it is that Kate Upton is trying to flog.
I think Nick Xenophon has rather misunderstood the purpose of Direct Action, which was to do nothing while fooling the gullible.
"An angry Xenophon said what was described in the discussion paper ‘neuters the whole purpose of Direct Action’."

Men, stop murdering women. Thats what, 30 now? Just stop it. Arsehats.
If GST is broadened across all G&amp;S then how are the low/no-income folks to be compensated? #auspol #abc730
Mate, if you have no grapes then you will have no wine to sell. You can't use up your growers forever. #abc730
And while these leaners pay sod-all tax, the rest of us are left to do the lifting. There's your budget emergency. You're welcome. #abc730
It's never a good look for political leaders to react to a media report about a thing they ought to have been across already. #abc730
And why does Tony need a current affairs program report to be apprised of such a dire situation? #abc730
Yeah yeah; Ice Ice Tony… How's that bloody budget of yours, anyway?

#abc730
Ye gods. It's neither piracy nor stealing. It's copyright infringement. It may not be right, but stop misrepresenting it.
But, FFS, stop calling it piracy unless there is murder and rape on the high seas involved in the copyright infringement.
Thank GOD. Someone is finally talking about UPLOADING. Too bad the #ABCRN journallist is missingvthe cue.
In any case it's the making-available-and-distributing that's doing the damage. THAT should be the focus, not "illegal downloaders".
3. All the other "downloaders" just somehow never get around to obtaining their copy the right way. IMO, out of plain laziness.
2. Some people would have paid but the distribution network said no. That's shooting yourself in the foot.
As far as the foregone revenue argument goes,

1. Some people were NEVER going to pay, so there is no revenue lost. It never existed.
(Never mind that copyright lasts way too long, but that's a whole different conversation.)
Uploaders and downloaders being the same person in a torrent is a feature of the platform, not the offence.
Why the talk of "illegal downloaders" and not "illegal uploaders"? They're the entities breaching the right to copy and distribute.
Is there a way to deny standing to copyright holders unless the material in question was legally available at the time? #abc730
Some of those "downloaders" are people who would otherwise have paid the proper cost of a copy if one were made available. #abc730
But you know, go right ahead and push more people onto VPNs and crypto in general. Whatevs. #abc730
Moreover, rights-holders need to go after the persons making the copies available, ie the uploaders. #abc730
FFS, it's not piracy. That's rape, pillage and murder on the high seas. You're talking about copyright infringement, @SabraLane. #ABC730
Come on #QandA, that's a lot of stop-the-boats gloating you're airing. #auspol
Could be lamb, could be venison; sell it as "mammal". Wouldn't happen, so why do we buy a meal as "fish"?
Going to scrutinise the hell out of future fish purposes.
It's like the Soylent Green of the ocean.
Finally getting around to watching Matt Evans's What's The Catch. The situation is a lot worse than I thought.
Let this be (yet another) lesson in Unintended Consequences for lawmakers. #TheDrum
A law selectively enforced is a bad law. #TheDrum
