Hey look, rain.
A&amp;B's Group Therapy is killin' it!
So god damn hungry. 12 hour overtime shift on a Saturday and only thing I've had is most of a kids sized pizza and a tea...
My mechanic thinks my engine will be ready to drop in about a week from now! #sr20det here we come!
Why am I cursed with a constant state of indecisive living? It doesn't matter if it's a minor or major, I just won't know what I want lol!
Starting the week right with a 15 hour day! Boo yah!
Sooooo fucking over this week.
I have so much energy right now, I don't know where it is coming from!! Maybe it's the warm weather ...
I am so excited for some warm weather
When I get bored I look at car forums, then immediately cry inside. Why do I torture myself!!
My healthy eating habits have died since my job turned to driving for a living... It needs to change.
Sure is weird when @Defond07 is gone, and I'm home alone. For starters I have to look for food....
TGIF
Such a strange feeling when you self reflect on yourself, and compare your past to present and how much things take such different routes.
Forever alone!!! ... At work.
Love getting overtime pay by Thursday morning, hate my job though haha
Woke up today feeling like it's Friday, then realized it's only Wednesday! Fuhhh!
Started tackling the cancerous rust on my car last night, going back for round 2 tonight, I'm ready! #Project180sx http://t.co/qW8fVvUkUR
Wow did Garden City really just lower the speed limit on Taylor street from 55 to 40. #fuckingidiots
Is it really 60 degrees And raining in mid Jan? ... But global warming isn't real right? Lol
Just purchased my timing components and rings for the #SR20DET. Now I should have all my parts to overhaul! I'm so ready!
I've been waiting for the weekend since Tuesday morning, is it here yet?? #exhausted
Had hiccups all night, just to wake up and get them again! #shootme
I want to be more productive and live a more worthwhile existence, but I haven't quite figured out how yet.
It's still cold.
It's cold.
Beer &amp; Wing over everything with @Defond07
#Gotta hustle today to make it home for New Years! #oilfieldgrind
Thinking about paying for someone to rebuild my #SR20DET. Anyone know where to start looking? HMU
God damn tornado came through my house last night!
Hey it is snowing! ... Aaand it stopped. #notsowhitexmas
Remember in middle school when you put your feelings on SM for everyone to see how you feel was cool. Glad we don't do that anymore!
Why do people take social media so seriously, it's not life and death! Just because I like/ shared it doesn't mean it's how I feel. #growup
Every man is a millionaire, at least by his sperm count.

Funny thing is that even these millions still go to women.
I think I actually like 4winds wings more than BWW.
My head is throbbing and I couldn't figure out why, until I realized it was after 3:00 PM and I still haven't had any caffeine!
I seem to have lost all patience to be at work, thanks Colorado for reminding me how much better you are...
Another day of perfect drift weather gone to waste....
Starting to get excited for our vacation to colorado! At this point I'll just be happy to leave Kansas, even if I just sleep all week!
Think I might switch back to Twitter for a min. Fb has me pissed off and annoyed.
I just want to puke. I need to get away, first week of December cannot come fast enough!
Good way to piss away any future you had planned.
I just wanna build my car!! :(
Almost. Home.
God dammit I fucking love it, don't you?
So tempting... Must resist. Lol
Why are we all cursed to want more?
It's so majestic watching the sun rise from the horizon every morning, and also very sad that I have to wake up before the sun every day.
I am loving this rain, but all this wind can fuck off!
I don't know how to feel about this... http://t.co/ZJ2zl9lnyM
It's hard to listen to techno for too long of a period. Reminds me of the past too much. Something's are better left there.
I guess she trapped me after ... http://t.co/29irkyXm7w
Workin hard today. http://t.co/5NmBCttvK4
It was so hard watching this disappear behind us on our way home yesterday. Missing it already. @… http://t.co/8G06MaHJf6
Funny the looks you get when you drive a skytrac forklift down the busy streets of GC at 430pm
I can usually make myself be patient for a lot of things in life. I have to admit, the wait to go pick up the plug &amp; play #SR20DET is killer
I drive these same highways so much sometimes I wonder what I was doing before I show up to my destination.... :/
This car gives me so much motivation for my build. It's nice to see a lot if ideas I had put to real… http://t.co/5dQT8h6XtK
Cool guy Doug that escorts oversized with me bought the caravan daylight doughnuts! Coolest guy around!
Nothing gets me more mad when someone who doesn't do your job tells you how to do you job. STFU!!
On that early morning #hustle. #nofilterneeded http://t.co/uwlgc4DABa
Damn. Never thought this would be real life, but that's what I get for thinking! http://t.co/ys4khxaQfp
The joy of looking for your job site. #oilfields http://t.co/6SSKIAGcUt
Nothing days it's Monday like a coffee chased down by an energy drink. #TheStruggleIsReal
