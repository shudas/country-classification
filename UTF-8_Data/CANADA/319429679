So can someone Carkner Subban next game?
So lets put MM with Turris and Hoffman with Zbad please. Chiasson has been a possession losing machine for the season
Sooooo.....pretty well hate the Habs forever and ever now
They are not perfect but I'm starting to like our defense more and more....just keep CP and Cowen in limbo
I fucking love the 3rd line
Has everyone been told to beat down Gallagher every shift? Or is he just an asshole and deserves it?
No penalty?? Wtf
Hoffman has some jets. Maybe thats why he plays with Legwand. Give the line some possession, speed and shooting ability?
Markov for Norris!
Chiasson gets like 4 crosschecks. Good times. No call
If by "sentient" you mean "good eatin" then I think we are on the same page ;)
Sens have accomplished something the Habs never could even dream of. Being so bad your accused of cheating. #WeCausedTheDraftLottery
Does anyone actually value Craig Button's opinion on anything?
Love how kn chopped the Vegan chef completely ruins her salad. Well done hippie
There has never been a goaltender as fun as Andrew Hammond. (Maybe Leclaire in a sad ironic way?)
One thing I feel bad about in after this Sens run, us I just don't care for Andy anymore...I feel really bad but Hamburgler fever ruined him
Vampire Diaries why do you follow me? I hate both vampires and writing.
So Easter Sunday I found my 2 year old hugging a Leafs Teddy my dad showed her. #WorstDayOfMyLife
Idea for a movie: Hockey team uses fast food nutrients to propel them through Championship  #Sens
Gotta say happy to have never been on team tank. I just wanted to dump all the garbage. The team basically did and look how far they came ;)
PLAYOFF HOCKEY!!!!
