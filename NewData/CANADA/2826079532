I love this show #TheRoyals
To the man who made all us oddball's feel like we belonged, thank you #LeonardNimoy
He played a man with no emotions who would not cry over anyone, but we all cry over him. #leonardnimoy
People come and go but I just hate it when the world loses a great influential person. So many more will come and go #LeonardNimoy
Still greaving but each day is getting a little better. #LeonardNimoy
You can't tweet a feeling...#LeonardNimoy
Alive in our hearts and minds never to be forgotten. Always missed. #LeonardNimoy
