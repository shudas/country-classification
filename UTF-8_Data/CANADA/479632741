You're going to have to give up something to get something
get out of your own way
Why is everyone so quick to judge when there's more than one way to get the same result?
Don't think too much, just do the best you can do now.. In this situation, and repeat for each moment. Good things will come.
Just realized this is the longest I've been out of province 😳 no wonder the struggle is faaaa realz
