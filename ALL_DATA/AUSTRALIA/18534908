Felicia: "No wukkerrrrrs!"
All of Australia: "Omg Felicia, no."
My new favourite insult: "You're harmless."
I want to see confused Final Fantasy and perplexed Fast &amp; the Furious fans join in the #FF7 hashtag
I think AAA could work in Australia, but probably not with American business practices.
Cityrail, if you could, stop being so late that all close connections to other trains are impossible for commuters outside of the city
Y'all, teenagers on the train called me cool. I have made it, it only took me 30 years. Hold my calls, I'm important now. üòé
Poor @amethystquarter having to put up with me http://t.co/RdzfXX9HRW
So bright and warm outside, where did all my cool weather go? üò≠
I am amazed at the things adults do out of spite. AMAZED. ADULTS.
When you write 'pork cutlets' as 'pork cutlists', you know it's going to be a day
For posterity https://t.co/wA6Au3NpFq
Just finished our #adventurejam game! Woohoo! @amethystquarter is awesome!
I'm sending in my @iAccelerateClub application today! Please wish me luck, I would love to get my company off the ground.
Ruined 'I Sat By the Ocean' by Queens of the Stone Age for @amethystquarter by substituting lyrics with "We're pashing ships in the night"
ALL THE ART IS DONE FOR OUR #ADVENTUREJAM GAME \o/ \o/ \o/
Draws a squirrel in a scarf, elephant in a bow, crocodile in a top hat. No problem. Can't draw a damned apple.
Did someone order a croc in a tophat? #AdventureJam http://t.co/ZLxeRPZJzt
For Twitter's personal records. https://t.co/XZhB9ouTOT
So, twitter, what hat would a crocodile wear?
Someone asked why I don't review games. Honestly, would be terrible. I'd put my personal opinion, and then rate something like 17/3.
When you live in an apartment block and the person above you can hear/understand the lyrics of your music, it's probably too loud.
(I am a little tired of Adam Jensen, will this make me lose friendships?)
Do you think bones are pretty neat? How about tarot cards? What if those two things were combined? https://t.co/m72KuNp6Yp
Like, Joe Hockey, you serious trying to put GST on games, music and movies? How much do you really want to drive business out of Australia?
This is an animal that exists. It is called the Indian gharial crocodile. http://t.co/jCjKtDlo1O
Did someone say they wanted a squirrel in a scarf?

No?

Well, I made one anyway. #AdventureJam http://t.co/YcHiWTnWZd
Ah yes, my nemesis. A flock of cockatoos. http://t.co/mNusrX3Rm2
"If I were a woman, I'd be a total slut!"

No, if you were a woman, you'd be totally sick of this shit.
I forgot about the security questions I made up (was asked to answer them by a CS rep)

'Can you answer this: How many penises do you have?'
Saying goodbye to my Microsoft CS agent was almost tearful, she's amazing? That was amazing? I don't even know how to feel.
Me and my Microsoft CS person are laughing and chit-chatting online. So unfortunate this isn't the norm! http://t.co/ylPm988GZE
I love that they aren't judging me http://t.co/JUgYgUma7d
love it https://t.co/jfvfnwqGC2

I don't care what people say, cats that have extra digits are AWESOME. Bring on the cat people!
Good morning, beautiful. Milk? Sugar? Of course. Now let me drink you.

"Just testing the dialogue system!" - @amethystquarter defending why he's typing about penises for an adventure game
I love that the armor in this game doesn't have hammered-in boobs. http://t.co/IouDfe3e6i
