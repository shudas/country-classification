Nancy has the best quotes. I love her but she's so republican.
Nancy: "If Hillary is elected the bible says God will unleash his wrath because we won't be able to protect Israel."
*Reading Hillary article"

Nancy: "We don't need her. She's another Obama. We have to get in and protect Israel like the bible says!"
Nancy is my bus driver and is a staunch republican and the following conversation comes from her and I...
I've read three articles over Hillary today and I'm so ready to vote #HillaryClinton #Hillary2016
