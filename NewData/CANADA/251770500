I just want to sleep..
I can do this, 4 more days.
Get me out of this shit hole town.
What's the point now... It's a waste
You can't trust anyone these days
I'm so exhausted, and my knees are in a lot of pain. Let me sleep for a week straight and I'd be happy.
A lot of women drive me absolutely nuts. Go fuck yourselves.
I could sleep for days and be perfectly okay with that
It's not even worth it now, whatever.
Biggest bitch

10 more days!
4 exams left, and 13 days until I get the break that I deserve. 4 months with my best friend :)
Maybe I should just stop talking.
Finished my last assignment of 2nd year! Now 4 exams to go and I'm halfway done by RN schooling.
Getting sick &lt;
Okay deltoid, stop spazzing...

Last day of clinical tomorrow! Sad to see it go, but relieved. Less stress.
Life's full of mountains you're going to have to climb.
No sleep for the next two days.
27 more days!!
Some cuteness to lighten up Twitter :) #CutenessOverLoad http://t.co/77ZpExMECF
