I joined the @nctafe team 10 years ago today. 6 different roles later I'm still challenged and loving it. #work
Great celeb endorsements for the release of #MortalKombatX . Here we see Shang Tzung's fatality. http://t.co/XFnMtsDo6n
Oh no! I'll miss @RHOMelbourne tonight!!! #RHOMelbourne
Love hearing Up by @ollyofficial at the bar :)
Yay! #Friday https://t.co/sn51KrrI77
It's Friyay!
I googled "Switch The Bitch" and I got the wrong book, @Gina_Liano was right. #RHOMelbourne http://t.co/hVnCMRUJMs
I want to see the #armtwirl at the #RHOMelbourne reunion @JanetRoachHW #eeeeeeverybooooody
Oh my! Next week looks amazing!  #RHOMelbourne
Seventy one-th floor? @lydiaschiavello  #RHOMelbourne
Which bitch switch is which? #RHOMelbourne
This tweet is so couture #RHOMelbourne
Switch The Bitch by @Pettifleur sound similar to The Bitch Switch by @OMAROSA  #RHOMelbourne
Yep, definitely want to be a housewife now  #RHOMelbourne
EMERGENCY! Hot men alert!  #RHOMelbourne
The storm is back! #tempest #RHOMelbourne
Shopping, champagne, Sydney and Manila trips... I want to be a housewife!  #RHOMelbourne
Those dog outfits are very couture  #RHOMelbourne
Cash dash!  #RHOMelbourne
Bling it on!  #RHOMelbourne
I don't even know what couture means :/   #RHOMelbourne
Booping with the kitty :) http://t.co/MmXJwjnDKy
If you're spending hundreds of dollars pampering your dog you should be donating to charity instead so it's not wasted @theprojecttv
I'd like @joelcreasey 's hot crossed buns @theprojecttv
I vote Liberal #ThingsJesusNeverSaid
I love Gretle. She should be on more often. Smart, sharp, funny. @theprojecttv
lol @joelcreasey referencing @jessicamauboy 's 'DayBut' reference, hilarious  @theprojecttv
How do you get to be one of the 100 people surveyed for @FamilyFeudAU ?
Rediscovering Fiona Apple's "When The Pawn..." album today. So good!
Delicious http://t.co/mYkK18C3xJ
Currently rediscovering The Miseducation of @LaurynHill.  Such a brilliant album.
I don't understand why people like dr who. What's the appeal?
"I forgot that inside we're identical, even though we have different genitals" - @FamilyGuyonFOX #hilarious
Well, today was a bit shit #work
Who would be watching #RHOMelbourne  ? Eeeeeeerrvery booooody @JanetRoachHW http://t.co/IQCMFlhYLd
Can @JanetRoachHW be Arm Twirl Barbie? #RHOMelbourne
Gina makes some fun digs which are clearly jokes, she's entertaining  #RHOMelbourne @Gina_Liano
So many gold dresses tonight...or are they blue? #RHOMelbourne  #TheDress
Tempest and Gamble are similarly rude. Should probably learn to control their outbursts, but it makes for good tv #RHOMelbourne
Yaaaaaas! More arm twirl! Eeeeeevvvery boddddy!  #RHOMelbourne @JanetRoachHW
Tempest is rather tempestuous  #RHOMelbourne
"Women carry their animosities a little too far" - that's the premise of the show, and we wouldn't have it any other way #RHOMelbourne
It's a nice mix with the new housewives this season #RHOMelbourne
Gamble cheers for teams like I do, by colour palette #RHOMelbourne
Not long until #RHOMelbourne - best day of the week!
Pretty happy right now

Who is that hot dude on @livingroomtv tonight? #yum
Thanks for a fun conference @CriterionConfs #socialedu - See you next time :)
Love #BerkeleyPOV #socialedu
Learning about Zayn leaving #1D at the #socialedu conference.
Ginger Spice is leaving the band?! What will they do now? #1D #ZaynMalik
The coffee is terrible. Luckily the speakers are great. #socialedu
Glad to hear everyone has the same challenges for resourcing, measuring, strategies and the balance of recruitment vs retention #SocialEdu
"social speed dating" Alicia O'Grady - love it! #socialedu
Reminder that 'tertiary' education isn't 'university' education. Tertiary includes VET education. Any TAFE's in the room? :) #SocialEdu
Voted! #auspol #NSWVotes http://t.co/zLcDflpDR7
It's ironic that #QandA is about rural issues but it's set in Sydney with hay bales. Typical metro view of rural Oz.
Damn. #QandA is round the corner from me at Sydney Show Grounds. Should of gone! @QandA
Short term strategy will backfire for Dee and Daz I think #TheBlock
"Reno Rumble" looks like the biggest waste of time. Flogging that dead horse are we @Channel9 ? #RenoRumble
I want a TV in my bathroom #TheBlock
No drawers?! Storage is a must! #TheBlock
Ooh! Excited about the scores tonight! #TheBlock
Loving the rooms on #TheBlock tonight @TheBlock9
I Am Number Four is a bad movie.

I can't wait till next week!!!!!  #RHOMelbourne
"@GambleBreaux is totally besotted with cash" in more ways than one! $$$  #RHOMelbourne
I'd buy a range of Barbie's based on #RHOMelbourne. #NouveauRicheBarbie
Sad.  #RHOMelbourne is almost over for the week.
The everybody arm is back! Yaaaaaaas!  #RHOMelbourne @JanetRoachHW
This is the best dinner party! Bitchiness, tears, singing waiters, new money...  #RHOMelbourne
"She's blonde I can't understand her" @lydiaschiavello - perfect!  #RHOMelbourne
The dynamic changes on this show weekly! I change my favourite housewife every week!   #RHOMelbourne
Gamble is so defensive! No one wants your wolfie!  #RHOMelbourne
"How fucking fabulous" @JanetRoachHW - sums up the serious really!  #RHOMelbourne
Damn @Gina_Liano - can I meet your friend? So hot!  #RHOMelbourne
Glad I could bring the world of live tweeting during #RHOMelbourne to @ChrisMcGovern5 :)
Yay! Dinner party confrontations!  #RHOMelbourne
Yay! @BenGillies888 is my favourite housewife!  #RHOMelbourne
I wish I were nouveau riche #RHOMelbourne
Are you switching the bitch tonight @Pettifleur or just being a bitch? #RHOMelbourne
Santa pants needs to fuck off  #RHOMelbourne
"A younger man appeals to me. Why would I spend my time pushing someone in a wheelchair?" Love it, Janet  #RHOMelbourne
Remember when your mum commented to people about your cute bum? Yeah, me neither   #RHOMelbourne
Pettifleur commenting that her son has a hot body is a little creepy #RHOMelbourne
I thought I would be more left that this... #auspol @VoteCompass #nswvotes http://t.co/WBpNqJuo1U
I want @JackieGilliesTV to be in the next Mario Kart game in with those buggy skills  #RHOMelbourne
Remember the last time you took the helicopter to golf? Me neither.  #RHOMelbourne
