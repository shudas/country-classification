I'm clearly in way over my head
Tired. Feel sick. Fuck my life. Work. Oh cock.
I wish people were awake when I needed them... Anyone for that matter, would love someone to talk to
So @0ctoRad smacked her nose while bending down because I made her laugh... I win this one
You're never going to stop until you've run yourself into the ground. Grow the fuck up.
You may not of realised it yet, but welcome to hell bud. Enjoy your stay
It's as easy as that to make a friend. But it's hard as hell to keep some of them happy
My mood right now, I don't know if I want to punch and wall or cry
It's nice to know you can't be assed with me
You motherfucking hypocrite
I miss school man...
Looking back I should of abandoned the idea of sixth form and gone straight to college, I'd have such an easier life now
Let's see how today goes 👀
It's got to that point where I can't even look at myself anymore..
The responses she gives me are why I love her 😂 @Em1lyWebb http://t.co/DWTWmhx9Va
If I wanted to be pestered by children I'd go back to school
It's a game, it's not affecting your real life, if you let it affect your real life though, I suggest you seek help.
Don't you fucking dare start pointing out my flaws when you've done worse than me you little prick
Waking up at nearly 3pm, no one to tell me that I'm lazy or can't lay in bed when I'm off work, finally some peace ✌️💭
You know, I can't believe you, get out of my life now.
"You're not funny" one of the most original things you could say 😂
When she's bored of you, you'll be gone bud soz 👀
Some old school 30 seconds to Mars, yes 👏
Payday tomorrow 👏 my god I need the money so badly
Can I get paid already? .-.
I've seen and heard of a lot of motivational quotes, and speeches recently. I should start listening to them
Ctrl+Alt+Delete you out of my life 👏✊
Red vs Blue season 10 just gave me the feels all over again. Goddammit @RoosterTeeth How are you so awesome?!?! #redvsblue #rvb

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
The Hawks are stalking 👀
Love having a clean room ☺️
Day off, think it's time for a day of @monsterhunter  I need some new equipment! #MH4U
Ever had someone place blame all on you because they're too pathetic to take blame? Yeah I have 😂
My eyes hurt more today ;-; fuck this shit
Really can't be assed for today 😂 tomorrow I'm laying in bed and anyone who wants me awake can piss off 😂
Bed at 3am again, sigh..
I'd really like to meet a girl that had my kinda sense of humour. People who don't understand it only get moody with me 😂
If I can see that shit without my glasses, it's not hard to see at all
So my Facebook messages don't want to send -.-
All I need is my glasses fixed, if I knew that all it'd cause is problems for you all I wouldn't of bothered
Fuck I feel ill, god help me ;-;
Sound about right for you, trying to be a cheap stake wherever you can expect on yourself 👍
I don't know what it is about it, but I fucking love this song @ASITISofficial  http://t.co/dCsx2eVsxC
It's like 7:45am I think I fell asleep at around 4am, I don't know how I'm awake but fuck I need a… https://t.co/QIo70ETH3K
Coffee ;-; need coffee
So much I want to tell you but I don't know if I can
I take the piss out of way too much for my own good, I'm a bad person :L
I've never been to the cinema at midnight, I think I made a good choice to start ^.^ #Avengers #Marvel #AgeOfUltron http://t.co/J3VdnKdiLX
I don't know why I bother, if I need help none of you really care and I'm too worried to talk to anyone else...
So I nearly got killed again, assholes.
It's amusing how manipulative humans are
You're all the same
Lie to me once, that's all my trust in this company gone.
You need to stop being a little bitch, and you should learn to take a joke 👍
Today is going to drag and be boring as hell
You've become everything you said you'd never be.. You all have
All I pretty much do is support people, even if it pains to me do so. Can I have support pls?
Sigh, today's been boring as fuck :( work tomorrow, I'm going to feel shit
Oh god @0ctoRad help meeeeeeeeeee http://t.co/zHm7tYD8bv
It's too early ;-; this why ordering stuff online is dangerous to me, I have to wait for the parcel
3 years ago today I was sat on the living room floor texting @0ctoRad 😂 http://t.co/62I6sB6HPe http://t.co/ycxHa6aJFW
Oh man I'm laughing so much @0ctoRad http://t.co/09eck8sKKC
I don't think I've ever felt so empty
It's true 👌 http://t.co/FNV53q1rOP http://t.co/JI6MDR3ca8
This is why I keep myself to myself.
That reality just hit me like a train
I love work at the moment, until the end of next week it's more like holiday ☺️ then I have a week holiday after that :3
So my phone likes to autocorrect "what" to "Megan"? How does that even work
Time for the shittest day ✌️ the only good thing about today is that after I don't have to worry about fuck all for 3 days
Don't even care, I'm so happy about this #FiveNightsAtFreddys #20202020 http://t.co/BMpOh5ehf4
That's disgusting. I have literally no hope in my generation.
I miss the old you..
I can't lie, the last year has been ridiculous. A year today was when it all changed.
I always feel better when I'm out at night rather than the day
I'm not sure if this is good or bad...
Hmm okay then...
You know it's nice to be wrapped in bed, being ill as fuck however no fun at all 😫
I'm not getting sleep tonight now am I
Fucking toxic, god.
What would my life be without YouTube, like seriously
Ever noticed that you're all talk?
Exit stage left
I guess that teaches me for waiting up
There are of very few people I can really trust and talk to, sadly they're all asleep
I clearly must have some extremely old fashioned views when it comes to dealing with these things
Who will fix me now? Dive in when I'm down? Save me from myself, Don't let me drown &lt;3
I can't sleep nothing is working
Honestly can't be assed with people tonight, I just want to text the small few I want to talk to
If I knew I was gunna get screwed at I wouldn't of bothered
Just fuck you, honestly I'm not in the mood and I now feel like shit.
Check out my broadcast from my PlayStation®4! #PS4live  live at http://t.co/xVTHd4TzL2
Eh its a stream and I get scared a lot?  live at http://t.co/xVTHd4TzL2
You know, it's impossible to keep someone happy if they can't look at themselves in a mirror and think "I like who I am"
Times like this make me want a car...
I hate my emotions, I hate how much I worry, I hate how I can't function properly anymore
It's so frustrating when people don't do what they're supposed to do
LETTTTSSSS DOOOOO DDDIIISSSSS
