boys are such stupid creatures, like really stupid, like plank of wood kinda stupid 👏
What a waaaaste of my time 😤
Bloods thicker than water but you still need water to live
Woke up this morning feeling like every single drop of positive energy had been completely drained from me
If I could travel without having to pay id be gone and I wouldn't be looking back
Had the worst sleep I have ever had 😔🙅
I want sleep but I have a verrrry strong feeling I won't be getting much of that tonight 😔
It's scary how certain people can change your views and actions towards things, I'm so blessed to have the people I do 👼
Lippy marks 💄 https://t.co/jvb6ijNZMD
Tom: Erin you're a flamingo, cos you're tall and pretty
Cannot wait to get home 😩
This is exhausting me 😴
Over thinking to the max 😔💭
Waaaay to confusing 🌀🌀🌀
A customer just put a bet on the grand nationals for me #oscartowin 🏇🏇
A girls day is 1000% needed today @erxn_ 👭
Can't wait for the evenings with drinks, music, a BBQ and friends! ☀️🍹🍻🎶
Tomorrow cannot come quick enough 👼🙌
Happy birthday @jessicadams13 👑 hope you have a lovely day! 😽🎉🎁🍷
You have to realise how much you're worth, to understand how you should be treated ☝️
Have absolutely no idea why or how people stay with there partners if they've cheated on them, no one deserve disloyalty
Once you trust someone enough to tell them your secrets, you then cannot make them forgot your business and I haaaate that
hate not know where I stand with someone/in a situation
all I wanna do is cuddle up n watch a movie n sleep 😴
Loooool don't make me fucking laugh kidddddo
You know when everything just starts falling into place ☺️
Woke up in the nicest mood ever 😇
The smallest things give me the worst anxiety eveeeeer
Need to stop wasting my time and energy on people who don't deserve it and concentrate on those that do 😇
I'm gonna need a looot of caffeine to get me through today 😴😴
Had such a nice day with my two favs 🐶👭🚶
👅🍊👭 https://t.co/Dq9tup3QKe
Mums convinced I'm doing drugs because I'm losing weight
😊😊😊😊😊😊
Sometimes saying less is more
Only I could leave my car keys in someone else's car 😴😴
Put your milk with my coco pufffffs
Why do I do it to myself 😖😫😖😫😖
I think I'm in hell
I am absolutely exhausted 😩😴
I'm absolutely exhausted and it's raining yet I'm in such a good mood ☺️
starting to see peoples true colours recently and I'm too happy right now to have the drama in my life 

Bye bye 👋
so many snakes about, feel free to talk about me and be nice to my face but it's a waste of time, I don't give a fuck what your opinion is
Fast and furious 😻
Looking at someone's tweet can be so misleading, twitter is full of the things people can't/won't say in person
Soooo happy at the moment, everything is going so well right now
so therefore 3- why the FUCK am I sleeping alone??? I've now officially woken up for the day that sounds like hell, brilliant
and 2- why is it so much easier to stay asleep/go back to sleep when you have someone else in the bed with you
1- why am I up regardless of the weather outside that sounds like it's hell calling my name
Feels like something has changed recently and I absolutely love it 💃💃💃
I'm having an allergic skin reaction to something but I have no idea what 😩 this is torture
Lakeside with @erxn_ today 👭🎀
Every time I start to feel any sort of negative way, I just wanna/do get drunk
I wanna go for a long drive 💆
Happy 19th @dc_crowley !! Have a good night 🍻🎉🎁
I have the funniest friends in the world
It's a thin line between love and hate
So crazy thinking back over the last couple of years 😶 so much has changed
Really need to get drunk tonight, like super drunk, like super now
Is it socially acceptable to start drinking now? 💆
Was hoping the lack of sleep I've been having recently would make me sleep till the afternoon but apparently not 😔
Look at that close up 😶 https://t.co/BQwwhlLWnG
Don't worry bout them girls over there cos they basic
I want to get drunk 🙅
Right now I feel like I could be in a room full of people but still feel alone
Why does no one love meeeee 😿💔😿💔😿💔😿💔😿💔
Happy birthday darl @Josh_hurcomb have a good one 🍻🎁🎉🎊🎈😽 xx
It's just to 🗻 that i don't give a fuck
love it when my mum approves of someone 😇
Knew I'd payed out a lot this month but checking my bank balanced has broken my heart. RIP me cos I'm not surviving this month
Over thinking things is a huge problem of mine
2 people followed me and 2 people unfollowed me // automatically checked by http://t.co/EPVei0x5Gr
Im so anti social in the mornings when I get on my phone after waking up, gotta check every social media site for the last 6 hours
Love my mum so much! 😇
Today is not my fucking day 😤😤😤😤😤😤
Why are we in bottisham n how do we get home
The men are jealous and the woman all in competition
Washing my hands with you 👋
Surrounded by amazing friends and family, got to change my mindset and put myself first for a change! 😇
Having virtually no sleep last night is killing me today 😴
Absolutely broken
my head is well and truly absolutely fucked
Refuse to become lost over this.
Fuck you panic attacks 🙅 fuck u 🙅
I am so quick to block everyone out, finally feel like im finding myself again and I'm suddenly lost in it all
So feddddd up of the constant shit, we aren't 5 now, you're quite fucking welcome to mention it too me personally you bunch of wankers
Neeeeed plans for tonight
It's too nice a day to not wash my car, my college work will have to wait... An extra hour or two won't affect the week and week late it is
Just found these on my phone, absolute muppets @jodieparknx @erxn_ @TomLamb1996 http://t.co/wm7fW5D2fh
so excited to think about what this year could hold for me 😇
Happy birthday @BarleyHutcher 🍻 have a good one! 🎉🍺🎁🎊🎈 xx
Feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach with a blunt knife
Absolutely hate letting my guard down
soooooo happy ☺️
