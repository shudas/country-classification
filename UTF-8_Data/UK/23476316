I convinced Tom that the Eiffel Tower on the Las Vegas strip was the original and the one in Paris is a copy. 😂😂🇫🇷
Not feeling doing a presentation tomorrow
Booking myself onto the Sex and The City tour for when I go to NYC 🇺🇸🗽💅
In this weather I come to realise I don't have suitable clothing for spring/summer as all my clothes are black/grey
Getting a real job is hard. FACT!!!

Cinderella was magical
My vegan food, is so vegany that I have to take a picture + let everyone know I'm a vegan because it's so cool to be a vegan. Hashtag vegan
Think I'm the only person who hates this weather. Comfy winter clothes over summer clothes any day of the week
I think watching everyone else drink last night has effected me and made me have a hangover.
Dog and Doublet is the only decent place in Wolverhampton
£10 to get in Yates/PopWorld last night. Was full of little druggies/underaged kids. #dontgoouttobabysit what a load of crap.
I love the double d.... The dog and doublet
I don't appreciate bank holiday weekends as I still have to work everyday
Do you know what's painful? Cutting up chillies forgetting and then touching your nose and eyes.
Knew the silly bint in New Look hadn't processed my returns correctly 😫😫
Glastonbury travel is sorted. Next step is picking the party tent @alex_caitx 🎉🍸🎉
'We can be heroes, just for one day'
Pregnancy is not a beautiful thing. FACT.

When you run out of eyebrow pencil. End of the world. Eyebrow game is not strong today
Intense.
I've missed just missed 4 trains because of drippy people walking around new street at snail pace. Need a rocket up their arse.
Letting go of your suitcase down that Sheffield train station hill is not a good idea. Your suitcase goes a lot faster than you do. FACT
Cannot handle today already. Just need someone to hold me
PR night out 🍸🙌💋 @IAMcelestenoble @KatieSanchez9 @imarnyray @beth_kearsley @Fayee_slann @HannahMcCreesh #wemadeit #theend 🙌
Can't believe Kim is on this KFC program

When you forget who your replying too and send your lecturer kisses 😱😫🔫💀
Final draft of my dissertation is done 🙌
Haven't rated this season of Girls
Sod's law on your day off you always wake up early 😴😴😴😴
Considering I have zero emotion over most situations, I've cried twice over my dissertation. 😭 least it's done. The End.
My mood could be described as meh, no effort for anything or anyone today. 😒
I feel like in my acknowledgements section I can only thank myself for writing the dissertation. 🙌
I've been writing my conclusion for my dissertation for the past 3 days. Can't I just put ...'The End'
I could be doing my dissertation but online shopping is so much more appealing
I don't know what's more embarrassing, the fact Tom farted and threw it at me, or the fact my mom saw him do it 😂
When you think you've tapped your mate..... But it ain't your mate @alex_caitx  😂😫🙈
Didn't really rate Guardians of the Galaxy 👎
Having to look presentable just to go to the shop is the bane of my life. Wish it was socially acceptable to go round in my pjs.
Those last 500 words of your dissertation 🔫🔫
My window ledge is too far to rise out of bed to get my drink but I have savage dry mouth. First world problems.
Some shocking eyebrows on First Dates this week. Feel bad for the porn star, he must have been a broke ass bitch.
Image therapy went well @alex_caitx 💪 closer to target each week
Knew I added a randomer on Skype instead of my dissertation mentor this morning 💀💀🔪🔫💣 http://t.co/2hAikDoaE8
900 words to go. 📚📖🔫💣🔪🔨
So worried I've added some Middle Aged man on Skype instead of my dissertation supervisor. All will be revealed later.
Just managed to watch Raised by Wolves. Got to love the classic shots of Banks brewery.
Did I miss the memo about how cool it is to be vegan. Everyone's vegan. Swear it's so when they post stuff online they can hashtag vegan.
Word on the street is Noël and Liam have made up = Oasis reunion = Oasis at Glastonbury as the Sunday headliner. 💭💭💭
I don't even think I can bare to watch it
I get the piss ripped out of me at uni for having an accent, I can 100% I do not sound like the actors in'Raised by Wolves'worst accent ever
Either booking a one way ticket out of here or seriously going shopping when all my uni work is done. 🌞🌏
Comedy Central is why I never get no work done. Friends marathon all day everyday
First dates is a class program.
I think I lost the sibling Mother's Day present battle this year. Nothing beats homemade gifts. Mark stepped up his game this year.
I ALWAYS cry at the end of Gladiator.
Erm @alex_caitx Tom made me cheat. I guess my vegetarian counts as Speed food right? Oops. http://t.co/BIky3kr0uX
Having to dash to a Sainsbury's because your sibling has out done you on Mother's Day presents💐
F the methodology.
The past was yours but the futures mine.
Just seen Shaun from This is England at Sheffield train station
Feel so much better after meeting my dissertation supervisor. Only 3000 words left. C'mon!
Royal Blood was pretty darn good
Half of my Dissertation is done. I feel like I need a drink 🍸
I am probably going to die tomorrow at Royal Blood. There fans be cray.
