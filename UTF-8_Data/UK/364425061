LibDems broke the most important promise they could promise my generation. A rise on tuition fees shows how "important" education is to them
Great day and response out on the doors in Nairn and in Inverness today #GE15 #activeSNP #AlreadyWorking
Can finally get a chance to to out campaigning again seeming I am off work today 🙌 #SNP #GE15 #AlreadyWorking
Love you @hausofeilidh 💕😘

If Jim is so against these nuclear weapons why doesnt he just scrap trident and say no to its 100 billion renewal?? Lmao stop #ScotsDebates
Murphy wants to help people off the dependency on food banks but votes for 30 billion of more austerity cuts with the tories!? #ScotDebates
Jim Murphy is like a drink of water stretched seriously 😒💤 #ScotDebates
Today has been so awful😓😤
Love my friends unreal ammounts💕💜
Gonna be spewing all of tomorrow omg 😒🎉
Don't be fooled by Nick he broke every promise he made to this country in 2010 &amp; hopped in to bed with the tories #leadersdebate
proud to be part of a party that is against nuclear weapons &amp; more austerity cuts on the most vulnerable in our society #leadersdebate #SNP

The only argument you should need to vote SNP is to scrap that big waste of money known as trident that we spend BILLIONS on.
Such a good night doing door to door canvassing and a great response for the SNP #AlreadyWorking #SNP #GE15
Record delivery of more austerity and siding with the tories is what should be written on here! #alreadyworking #SNP http://t.co/U969oJ6HoB
Such a great night out canvassing with the SNP tonight getting excited for the elections now! 🎉 #VoteDrew #AlreadyWorking #GE15
Nothing kills me more than seeing my friends upset😞💔
Love how unelected house of lord members are the ones to decide that 16&amp;17 year olds in Scotland don't get to vote elections. Hypocrisy.
Nothing I hate more than someone old telling me how I am "too young" to know or understand which party to vote for in the elections.
Soo many amazing things planned for this year😱🎉
11 hour shift tomorrow 💔🔪
Seeing people i love being so hurt literally breaks my heart so much 💔

Soooo cold after campaigning tonight but it was so worth it #AlreadyWorking  #SNP

Campaigning with the SNP tomorrow night 👏📋
My under manager spilling 24 pints of milk all over herself was the highlight of this morning still cant stop laughing 😂😭
I am not afraid. I won't burn out in this place. My intention is to fade and I will, I will.
Fed up of never being good enough.

Parties are happy to spend 114 billion pounds on a weapon of mass destruction while 1 in 3 children in Glasgow are in poverty... I give up👋
So thankful for the friends I have made in the past year they are all just so amazing 💖

Can just tell I will wake up tomorrow and want to smash my phone when I see the texts I sent.
so buzzing for drinks tomorrow night!
I always get so fired up watching question time I need a padlock to keep my gob shut lmao
The SNP are the 3rd biggest party in Britain and are not getting any representation in the debates why not involve them too!?
