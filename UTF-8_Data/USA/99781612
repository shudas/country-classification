Sometimes you gotta look at things differently and just see the bigger picture.

The only time you should ever look back is to see how far you've come.

I can't be out here on no laid back shhh ..
Keep my boy @TheHurraKane in your thoughts &amp; prayers as he gets surgery tomorrow! The GAINZ are gonna be toooo real once he's 100% again 💯💪💪
Notre Dame is shooting out of their minds 😑 Sheeeeesh...
The struggle of having an itch under your cast......

Thought I'd bring out the famous foam finger for the game we've all been waiting for! #SHOCKEM 🌾🏀🌾🏀 https://t.co/MD8OHigGxv
I don't remember the last time I've been this excited/anxious for a college hoops game 😁 KU vs. WSU 🏀😈🔥💪
Let's go Shox! 🌾🏀
Y'all might think I'm crazy, but I think KU loses to New Mexico St. today. Just my opinion though 😬
RJ Hunter... Ice in his veins!!
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored ..
Happy Birthday S/O to my boy @joeymeyer35!!! Have a great day brotha!
Okay I don't know bout y'all, but I think Christian Laettner is a badass. I'm a fan!! 😎👊🏀
Can't believe Wichita State is a 7 seed.. The Midwest region is absolutely stacked.
Good luck to my dudes @TreyOneil12 @BMeyer44 playing for another state title today! Do what y'all do best, that's win baby win 😎
S/O to my SJ guys going for that 3 peat today! @sjcoachk @ckinnamon10 @deanwade3232 @Alexischino_14 @CallerosJorge @calleros_09 Get it done!
Wish I could be going to PCB with my boys @LaytonLeydig23 @Treymendous24 @jimma31 😩 Have fun fellas &amp; send lots of snapchats 👍
Lol so who was the savage that drew those masterpieces on everyone's vehicles at CCC 😂😂
Surgery went well. Just another minor setback. As if I needed another ounce of motivation...… https://t.co/j2i3YNX125
JEREMY MACLIN IS GONNA BE A CHIEF!!!
She my trap queennnn 🎵🎵

This dude's mindset is incredible. When he speaks I listen! http://t.co/daQthxiEY2
Surprised my baby sister at her game tonight! Never gets old watching her hoop. Can't wait to be back… https://t.co/xqKGIAcHxj
Loved seeing my two brothers tonight! It's been way too long!! @ St. John High School https://t.co/5cZJxuvSYE

http://t.co/wPYawSXag6 - Never been a huge fan of Kobe, but it's hard not to be one after seeing this whole interview..
Ankle surgery a week from tomorrow 😓😰
This basketball season flew by... Feels like just yesterday we were starting pre-season.
Hate it had to end that way but these guys are my brothers man. I couldn't have asked for a better group of guys. #TrojansOn3FamilyOn6
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Man I look up to God, I wonder if I fell from the sky. Would I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly?
Happy Birthday to my "PIC" @Dylan_Allison10! Haha. Love and miss you bro!
Happy Birthday @BeRealTheis!
Sophomore night here in Colby for my boys @joeymeyer35 and @KhyWooten_! Come out and support for our last home game of the year!
Just goes to show you it's not easy to win on the road in college basketball. No matter who you play!!
Always gotta remember there's someone out there that looks up to you

Only people I need in my life are the ones who are gonna better me as a person and push me to be the best I can possibly be 👌
Good catching up a little bit with my man @ChaseBanister tonight!
Teams are gonna storm the court, ranked or not. It's a such a huge deal beating a team that's as dominant as KU is year in and year out..
J. Cole is gonna be in Wichita March 15th and I'm gonna have to miss it 😪😒
"Nobody looking out for nobody, maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody"
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me.
Hate losing man. Especially like that..
Happy Bday to my PG @BStarr_2! Enjoy your day bro and let's get this W 😎 http://t.co/OcUyIrQ3K6
