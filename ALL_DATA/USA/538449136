EDC social tonight but have zero idea what to wear 🌈💕💜🐸 #whatisplur
Senior wills is the scariest because it means I actually have to let go of part of college. 💔
Is it really school when free ice cream is given out on campus and you get to layout by the pool?
There is no greater feeling than that of never having to take economics again and passing with an A #thisblondesgotbrains
Watching supernatural and getting homework done, I like this kind of productivity 💁🏼
This time next week I will be in "Orlandeaux" and I just can't even focus because I'm so excited 😭💗
I GOT MY FIRST CAMP OF THE SUMMER WITH MY TWIN OMG OMG OMG! #hellomississippi #icried #brittlyngoestothesouth
Picked up my stole today... It's getting real
I think I will permanently smell like Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen and honestly, I'm not mad about it.
Chapter at the pool, is that even a question? #asualphaphi #onebigpool #fullofaphis
50 shades of bags under my eyes #teamnosleep
I swear my mom never answers her phone, but if I don't answer before the first ring she gets pissed

How much of my material do I know already? The fight song. That is all. And without music. #staffprobz
I love spring because I get to wear my white shorts again 💗💜
I can't say I'm mad about moving home in a month because I get my own bathroom again 🙌🏼👸🏼

Need some ice for that burn? No, but I do need some aloe vera 🆘☀️🚫

Cucumber water, the smell of sunscreen and 80 degree sunshine. #perfectday
Good thing it's baseball season again, I can finally understand what's going on in the world of sports ❤️⚾️
I officially know I'm getting old because I just tried tumbling without stretching and all my joints cracked and popped 🙈

Causally just started singing all of the alpha phi recruitment songs... I don't want to graduate 😭
I've received a swimsuit from the easter bunny since I was little and I am so grateful my momma still follows that tradition 👙💗 #HappyEaster
I can always tell when it's almost 8 o' clock because I become narcoleptic and pass out wherever I am at that point in time #never2old4naps
Jellybeans don't count as bad carbs on Easter weekend 💗🐰🍭 http://t.co/RqD1Sh30AP
4.5 miles in 85 degree weather was a stupid idea 🔥 #somebodycall911 #shortyfireburning
Talking with my dad about Epcot has me so anxious to get back to UCAisland! T minus 18 days!!
I had my blinker on to turn into a parking spot and some asshole pulled around me and swooped into the spot. I hope you burn in hell.
If hanging on the monkey bars upside down is wrong, I don't ever want to be right. http://t.co/qtfQ1omB4e
Since I'm going to Louisiana for a month does that mean I need to start learning how to spell everything with a "eaux"?
Almost 22 years later and I still get compliments on my name. Good job mom and dad ❤️
Stretch double downs into the pool are never a good idea...
A great day with my momma is a day well spent ❤️
Really missing my brother today. Can you just come home already?
🍃 Mint water is life 🍃
I need a pedicure and 10 million dollars
Took a solid 45 minute shower to try and get glitter out of my hair... It's still there...

If you can guess what movie I'm watching, we can be BFFs
It's 10:30 and I'm in bed already. The grandma life has struck
On my next Disney adventure I just want to push the beds together and have one big staff sleepover. Is that asking too much?
Using my babysitting money for airfare and I wouldn't have it another way
If you give me a back massage I know it's real

The amount of emails I have sent today is a little insane, am I a professional yet? #makingmoves
Holy cow I was not expecting to have this quick of a turn around by sending out my resume an hour ago. 🙈😳
Trying to explain "what would you do for a dollar" to people here and it isn't working. 😑 get me to UCAisland already. #onemonth

Get me out of this state, I don't belong here.
I'm honestly not sure how I obtained half the numbers in my contact list
I forgot how much I loved circuit training #sundayfunday
Woke up in a panic thinking I slept through day two of competition only to realize I'm not in Florida... I'm at home. #withdrawls
Talking with my brother after spending the day with my sisters has been the most perfect Saturday 💗
My parents went to a spring training game and top golf this weekend without me, ugh rude.
Mah lil mah lil #houseretreat #asualphaphi http://t.co/g4u28khw3G
Riding the pink cheeky to house retreat woot woot
I add lime juice to all my food because it masks the bad healthy taste
1. Why am I the only one home? 2. Why does nobody go out with face paint here? 3. Why do I not live in the south?
Not being at school in 12 days yet still getting an A on my exam just now 🙌
