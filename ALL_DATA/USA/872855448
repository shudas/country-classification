Positivity

Problems
Damn what a good night this turned into :)
Happiness is made when you can smile when you fall 😊
You treat me like an option,
I'll leave you like a choice!
If you’re losing your mind, you can jump into mine
Let me open your eyes to a world that is blind
Everyone wants more but you get what you give.
In life it's more then me that's why it's called the bigger picture.
I-Ii-Ii want to love you,
But if it's not ri-ii-iight what can I do.
Everyone I know could be so much more then a check,
so much more then a grade,
So much more then a test.
I'm better off alone anyway
Putting it all in the past
It sucks that we couldn't make it last.
Kinda sucks.
😕😕😕😕😕 
there goes my night I guess...
