"For the First Time In Forever" from Frozen perfectly encompasses my feelings about starting college.
Never have I been so excited that someone was voted off a show. #sorrynotsorry #FoodNetworkStar
If you are not at the Royal Oak Church of Christ right now- you're missing out.
Narrowing down what books I am bringing to college has been a tougher decision than choosing said school. #booknerdproblems
A whole summer and not one trip to Cedar Point- now that's sad.
College means only taking 5 classes. #holla
Late night cinnamon streusel coffee cake muffin baking because why not.
