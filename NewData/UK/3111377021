So I love you
Just as long as you no the truth
As am no good way gadgets  or twitter
So its a bit like  the computer I don't no what you write cos I don't no how too
Just to say david I don't follow you on twitter I just tweet
And can't wait till I meet you to just say thanks for  everything  you did
I no you will david help to change  me and I love you for it  cos iv got a few bad happets
But you will help me change my  mind  and ways
I no David am all over the place but you can help me when I see you its just because no one told me the truth
But david I really like  to see you
But for some how they never did
And I should have been told truth  bye my family
And it cos of no one will tell me anything david
Cos I need to move I hate living hear
Monday or bye saturday
Is that if you do it soon I can get out off hear by
All is I ask is that
But you no called the night too  so I await your call I think I wait for another two years if I have too
Oh I no the staff no I no and I no David will call if he still likes me
But in in morning so I await your call
Out for dogs hair cut at 2 back at4
Looking today in Glasgow but she no see anything
And need to go for a dress for me daughter  for her party
Me dog for her hair cut tomorrow
Or came for me I just had enough now and it time to leave
The it is and was real but my text never  got text back and no one told me
It's just no one ever text me back too confirm that  was on computer
But I think there was a lot
As I never seen what was on computer
I don't no if everything I text to my sister got there
But that just getting it of me chest
And I had my back pack ever time I new they where come
Too me so I new  year past but no one came
I  new staff watched me too out back  I  they should have phone me too come
Just good I got it off my chest  as it been in me for a bit  and maybe the truth will come out now
I just need to get off my chest
So ill no say anything else
And its is time for it all to stop and me no the truth
And I don't blame my sisters there still helping but no telling anything else
And the men he work with  so thank you
All because he try ed to go out  with me he found out
Even I can't get divorced  because he's holding it up my ex for two years
And if it was not for David telling everybody what happen  no one would have done  anything
They all never stood and help till it was to late  to
And my family
Cos they all new
Ever body from police health people have all failed  me
My sisters should have told me there two scared of  the  out come
Oh bail  for good behaviour
And my ex is the cos of it
But they still do it again again and again
Police trying to give them a chance
They got bail so there out and still do it
But I need to be told the truth
And still to the now I don't no anything apart from paper
Yes I have changed my mind a lot but no one  would tell me the truth
And could have done TV but I  was never told they where come or no one phone
I could have been away for hear with  staff  long time ago but no one told me
And it comes down to no one telling me anything that's why I want a big change
Some times change is good but I need a big change in my life for the better
But I will change for us  but I want you
Off me because I all way change my mind but that  is down to what am going throught
But you never phone so that's why I think you are in dowt
I just need to move or change house
I think you think I will change but I dont
But I don't no how you feel
David you no I love you
My sister keep  holding it up but no more
But Simon Cowell  bye my story so there's just thing that's not  been give
Would make get out of this country for good
So in your heart and for me can't you just give that thing if you can't make that call it
And I need to you to do it for me my sister would do it but I give you it to change mine
You have not phone yet so your in dowt
Cos I can't live the way I am it's no good
Even if you think you can't just give me the thing  that  w ill
Your one step  away from helping me make that change
So make that call to help change my life as no one else will
To hurry up and for someone to do it for me to make that call
So you understand  it is real and it's hard and no one will listen
And you need to make  that call to change my life
I no now you no you need too do it to get me and kids out your just my hero
As my life is hard and it's a bit daft
That's good david you said that's it
And I will wait on your call  or do I see you Friday  or my kids out thrusday
So will I david be away from hear by Monday
But you have to call
And you can choose to go
With me but you will phone soon and I can move out of where I was live
It's okay if you give me a call before I was leaven the UK I was going to ask you to drop everything to come
Getting workman out Friday morning for me 2 sinks the no draining away david
And its cos of these ones and my ex doing it
But just phone try talk to me cos all this is nuts
I told my sister that's what I was doing
Cos the way I feel that I want to run away
They will kiss you cos it you have stop me from going on a plane the morrow
But when it keeps happiness I just want to leave the country to start new
You must have read my sister mind as they say I can't run away I need to stay
But let the people no
