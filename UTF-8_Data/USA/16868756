Worth remembering: Montana would’ve passed the Medicaid expansion in 2013…if one lawmaker hadn’t accidentally cast the wrong vote. #mtleg
Medicaid expansion bill (SB405) just passed the Montana House #mtleg, 54-46 vote.
Re: #mtleg debate, does Medicaid expansion actually save lives? Some experts say yes: http://t.co/2FgD12iiVb http://t.co/XImzJSzPBn

Read the CJR report on Rolling Stone. Thought they missed one important detail: The type of story that Erdley normally specialized in.

The ACA was signed into law in March 2010. The private sector hasn’t lost jobs since. http://t.co/fI8Y5XQNqB http://t.co/Xlbb7YnxIn
Private sector has gained jobs for 5 straight years — a record. http://t.co/n5kD2QqDLF
Jobs gained…

Under W Bush: ↑ 1.3 million
Under Obama: ↑ 7.2 million
ACA effect?

· Hospitals saw best 6-months of jobs growth since 2008
· Ambulatory sector had its best 12-month run *ever*
In the past year:

· Health care: ↑ 363k jobs
· Construction: ↑ 282k jobs
· Manufacturing: ↑ 188k jobs

· Federal government: Added 0 jobs
A reminder: How the jobs report can fool Americans and trick the market. http://t.co/ac28raCLJi
Worth a reminder: The initial jobs report has a +/- of 100,000 jobs. 

In March: U.S. could’ve gained 26k jobs -or- could’ve gained 226k.
Today's Emoji Jobs Report:

🏥 - added 22,300 jobs
🚚 - added 9,500 jobs
🍔🍻 - added 58,700 jobs

🏭 - lost 1,000 jobs

Overall report: 😁
In March:
· Hospitals ↑ 7,900 jobs
· Doctors’ offices ↑ 6,100 jobs
· Home health ↑ 6,000 jobs

· Nursing care facilities ↓ 6,000 jobs
Bad jobs report — just 126,000 new jobs in March — but pretty good for health care, which added 22,300 jobs last month.

Again: Credit to @mcuban for engaging his critics. While he’s wrong on health care, he’s directionally correct — more testing is the future.

Arguably the most interesting part of @mcuban’s riffs: What it reveals about a smart guy with $$ to spend, who thinks he can fix healthcare.
