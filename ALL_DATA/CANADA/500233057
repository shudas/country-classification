Pretty mean of coworkers to try to convince you that you gotta work late and maybe miss part of the jets game :(
Watching geese fight is amusing. They seem to be pretty protective of their mates lmao
The means by which jets fans entertain themselves on Twitter on gamedays is beyond ridiculous lol

Is Ladd playing tonight?

Already shaking with excitement...still another 8 hours to go. I need help lol
I'll die if the jets win today. I'll die if they don't. Haha I'm screwed
