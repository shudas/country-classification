It's going to be an absolute miracle if I pass my first year of uni
Yeah, good one.
My first year in uni summed up pretty well #huddersfield #uni https://t.co/VKg7SEIHWf
Well the saving for Thailand begins, maybe just one more game of Blackjack though...
Chilling in the sun with ameliamccreith and alex_spindler ☀️ https://t.co/YleQqitBLd
Always love seeing City lose 😁
Days like today just justify why I hate 99% of the population
Best highlight of my first year at uni, giving _shingstagram a Flat 92 special haircut whilst still… https://t.co/XARzOhRgEq
What's with the sudden obsession with girls getting tattoos under their boobs? They look absolutely terrible...
This guy seems eager 😂 http://t.co/WSr0gMN7hW
You know your life is on a downwards spiral when you're watching Flog It
Skegness train is always full of delinquents
Why can't I grow a fucking beard. Being 25 looking 18 isn't the look I wanted at all
So much work to do, don't even know where to start
So glad Easter break is here, need the break 😅
Love doing the Scousers over, scummy cunts.
Stressed out of my head, urgh.
Why did I choose to study computing?
Looking forward to tomorrow night #camelforlife
Why are all French people absolute cunts
So all my lectures got cancelled today, unexpected lie-in's are the best.
Being the only guy out with 4 girls, face says it all #five #huddersfield https://t.co/2pf2P7GJzs
Going back to bed between lectures was probably the worse decision I've made, I cannot physically move
Can't beat a bit of oldschool Brand New. Deja Entendu, what an album
My new sounds: Give It To You https://t.co/zTbsMptnCp on #SoundCloud
Been working in revs all day, drinking in revs all night
To say I'm tired after that shift would be an understatement
Not sure how I feel about having to stay in Huddersfield all summer...
Think I'm gonna apply to be on The Undateables, I'd fit right in 😂
Only good thing about Tuesdays, new episode of Better Call Saul
Odd to think half the people you meet in your first year of uni you'll probably never speak to or see again. Can't wait for year 2 though...
Girls on Tinder are so classy... http://t.co/301NwLPbhx
I haven't done any Uni work since December, should probably change that...
What the hell went on last night?
So I wake up to the internet exploding about a colour of a dress. http://t.co/synigs2RcS
Proper fancy a pint. Pint anyone, no? Pint? Okay then.
I probably should go in more often on a Thursday, don't think once a term is enough...
So I'm doing a computing course and I need to write a paper about Diabetes.. Why do I bother with uni?
I'm probably the worst person at food shopping, always end up getting more junk food than proper meals..
Got an interview at #revs, the dream is happening..
Reading week should be 2 weeks long
Pass me the cider
Might have an interview next week to work at a golf course, I don't even like golf.. A jobs a job though! ⛳️
I just want a job again, fed up of having nothing to do every evening/weekend!
£1 triple vodkas will be the end of me
You know someones a bit of a cunt when they put their name as "Big Abz" on Facebook.
Better Call Saul is definitely on par with Breaking Bad, can't wait for next weeks episode!
Fucking fed up of the same shit every game United play, it's embarrassing.
Might as well not even have a reading week, half my lectures always get cancelled into it anyway..
Looking forward to moving into our house in year 2, the thought of living with @Jagohn scares me a little though..
Last lecture until a week off, I love you reading week
I really do wish the fire alarm would stop fucking going off in Camel every time I go there
Wish I went out now, bored bored bored
Had a dream I was on trial at Inter Milan, fair to say that didn't go well..
Had an awesome birthday flat party for my 25th yesterday, couldn't of asked for a better night
You know you've got a cool kid on your course when he comes ballin' in with his "Computing and Engineering ambassador" t-shirt on #swag
My sleep pattern is shocking, wish I could just get to sleep at night 😒
Party preparations begin tomorrow, buzzing for Wednesday!
Never understood the hype behind Super Bowl, never will.
Think it's everyone's mission in my block to not let me sleep today 😴🔫
I love insomnia :)))
Actually can't wait for next Wednesday, gonna be so good
Been in uni for an hour and the lecturer still hasn't turned up, why did I get out of bed..
Only a week left until the best flat party The Castings will ever have 👏
So undecided 😩
Missed the gym 4 days in a row, already slacking
So my halls has had no water for nearly 4 hours now, we're all gonna die
Bored of being bored, I need something to do on weekends
Mans getting angry in the courtyard, all kicking off @ The Castings
Drunken dickheads need to shut the fuck up quicktime
How do I keep getting firsts on assignments I have no idea what half of the stuff is on my lecture slides 😂
Camel was buzzin' last night with 5 people in there, shocking isn't the word
Can I just be summer now, without the having to move back home part?
Haha, how ironic.
I will go to the gym at some point, but getting out of bed is just too much of a struggle
Missing friends from back home, even if they are as mongy as @bradley_spencer 😉 http://t.co/O7zJZDDeHM
So tempted to just quit uni and go live in America 🇺🇸
People getting their student loans 2 days early and I'm just sitting here £600 into my overdraft.. I can't manage money for shit
6 days into 2015 and I already hate this year. Brilliant.
