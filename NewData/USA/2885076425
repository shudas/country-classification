WHY ARE YOU SO DARN BEAUTIFULLY HANDSOME, DANNY TRAN? YOU MAKE IT HARD TO BREATHE .
I just want to surround myself with people that have good vibes and do not find it enjoyable to make another persons life hell #SOUL
I got no time for immaturity.  Don't start drama with me ... WE ARE GRADUATING IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS! ;D
I have a ton of homework to do, but have no motivation to do any of it at the moment...
You are just so cuteeee that I hate saying goodnight when you make me feel so awake and so in love ):
I am 200 pages in and already there has been 63839363 plot twists in this book lol GOT MY HEAD SPINNING

Curse you Express for making me want something I can't stop thinking about ))));
For the first time in my life I actually saw a materialistic thing that I WANT ssssooo bad besides a piano !
Danny and Martha are seriously my best friends... I know I can trust them with everything that is goin on.
