Every time I have a big feed I wanna go to sleep. I should walk it off, not sleep on it.
Feeling lonely. I'm awake and on my own. Wanna do something.

Now we're all wondering what to do for new years.
Why is it called #BoxingDay? Throw out the boxes from yesterday?

She is consistent and relevant.
I'm pissed!

Both ways
Gordon Tallis. I hope you got you moneys worth.

(Not much coz you're a Queenslander)
Tallis been there, done that!

He should have known not to keep questioning Thurston after that bullshit display from third umpire.
Fuck you! NQ cowboys robbed and assaulted at the same time in the last 30sec. I've lost faith. I'll stand by Thurston. No matter.

I must be the only black person that doesn't think Kevin Hart is funny. All he got is little man jokes and a bung eye.
I'd make good wife someday.
