If you see something awesome, talk about it.  I rather hear or see great things from everyone.   #letitshine
Attention for my freelancer people who live in Phoenix, when you fill out the tax forms,  what the heck do you put as your starting date?
So Column and chapter should hopefully be up tonight.  I need to sleep...and watch the last two episodes of daredevil.
All I got to say is that Daredevil is awesome, and my roommate boycotts flying squirrels.   (don't ask.)
Can someone from Arizona help me with the tax forms do I can come to your show? I have no idea what to put in for dates on some stuff.

Comic thoughts:  What can top saga month in and out?  Still the measuring stick of modern comics.
Tonight new chapter will be posted.  #Wattpad #writing
talking to a friend halfway across the world, I realize:  We are all the same.  We want and seek the same things.  Why are we so afraid?
Would young me be proud #youngmetodayme

Before I get violent with Devil May Cry, I just want to thank everyone that works with me.  You all rock and I appreciate all of you.
Happy Easter to all.  Whether you celebrate the Messiah or worship Ishtar, I hope you had a good one.
One of them involves a family member I've been wanting to work with for a long, long time.  I may push her too hard, but I believe in her.
This week more concentration on some stuff.  It's NOVEL time #itsclobberingtime and hopefully I get to start working on two special projects
And just like that, another draft handed in.  poor @MirrorWorldPub , now they got to read all the rough stuff.  #book2
this tea isn't having a good day.  A happy accident http://t.co/1elTkKsW08
Phoenix Comiccon May 27- 30th.  I will be there and I will bring books.  Cannot wait.
Lastly, Loving Wayward by @JimZub.
Gotham by Midnight is a surprising gem.  I blame @rileyrossmo1 for this series discovery.  Sad this is on hiatus till June.
Enjoyed the Valiant.  The Immortal Enemy is a much more dangerous villain than ever, and really enjoyed the story.  Valiant indeed.
Comics thoughts:  Really enjoyed Ms. Marvel.  Finally picked up last month's issue and was amazed.  One of Marvel's best books hands down.
