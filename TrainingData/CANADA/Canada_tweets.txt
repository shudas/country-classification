People are quick to judge - hardwired for hatred. I don't mind if someone doesn't like me, I'd just prefer if they actually had a reason
I miss having somebody to love

I will never understand how people think cockiness is cool
Enthusiasm is infectious
I feel like a lot of people type the word defiantly instead of definitely, but actually mean definitely
If you need a valentine to feel special then you need to re-evaluate your values
Oh how I would love to love again
Let's be the change that we want to see in the world
