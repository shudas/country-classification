You NEVER know what somebody is going through. Be nice to everybody, and if that's too much for you, be humble.
but you didn't have to cut me off, make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
not going to complain about my grades, i'm just grateful i'm even being educated
finally motivated to go on a run
but homework
if ever you need someone, well not that you need helping
but if ever you want someone, know that i am willing
so much homework
no motivation
so many choices on netflix
i'm so excited for marching band
happy easter!!! 🐇🐥🌞
