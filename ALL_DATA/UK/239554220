A little honesty goes a long way
So poor right now
But I'll be at uni and won't be able to afford peanuts
Snapchat has really made me wanna go to Coachella next year
Im so useless at this
I actually don't look 12 in my new passport photo 👌
I know I'm close friends with someone when all we do is take the piss out of each other
Would love a riverside apartment in Central London
Home Sweet Home!👌 #Brentford https://t.co/a9p5WCi0ww

No matter what I'm getting up for, I'm never a morning person
Only spent £20 last night too, cracking
Well last night was unexpectedly good!

I'm just shattered all the time

Hate having to justify myself and my actions to others all the time
Could do with a whole day in bed today
Should really get fitter but McDonalds Monopoly
One 2 hour kick about with the boys and my legs feel like they're going to drop off
University = pending
Just can't wait to go on holiday
Should save money really.
Retail ruins weekends
Remember when Saturdays used to be full of lie ins, junk food and TV? Me neither
Greggs breakfast = Happy Adam
Too. Early. Need. More. Sleep
Surround yourself with people that bring out the best in you

Forget the Mini Cooper or the £100,000, 6 Free Chicken Mcnuggets is the real jackpot in McDonald's Monopoly!
"Ever feel like you're just an annoyance to someone?". Me "Yes, all the time"
My phone signal is shite tonight!
If only I could find time and fianance a year's travelling in America!

People should try and better themselves each and everyday, be successful
Confidence is key
Quality night
Trevor Sinclair's bicycle kick 👌
Chelsea this season very similar to Man United two years ago, can grind a result out when not playing that well.
What a relief
I'm bored of the same old stuff, day after day
So nervous
Shattered
Such a good couple of days
Manchester 👌👍🎉 https://t.co/D4S8Vx231z
I will not apologise for my Snapchat story this weekend!
Would love to go to a festival this summer but hate the idea of tenting and poor personal hygiene
Definitely more goals in this game #brentfordfc
I spend half my working day yawning and the other half moaning about not being in bed.
Relevant! "@UKBanter: making plans in the groupchat like http://t.co/BA87uDRYV4"
I hate half term, all the cheeky little shits about town
Don't over think things
Love the smell of fresh paint
Nights out in Banbury get very tedious and repetative very quickly
Still have to get up early start though 😒
Love going to bed knowing I have a day off tomorrow
My phone is just shit
I can't manage money, fact.
Despite my love for pancakes I am atrocious at flipping them!
Shouldn't have gone for a run before work this morning, I ache everywhere.
Just need a decent nights sleep
Sometimes I just stare at my Gmail waiting for uni offers to come through.
Dad returns home from work and says "We don't need to have pancakes tomorrow right? Your too old for that stuff" How dare he
I get so excited thinking about summer
Finally hit me that excessive boots meal deals, fast food and vast quantities of alcohol have made me rather unfit over the last half year.
For someone who overuses snapchat and takes far to many pictures on nights out, I really do hate my picture being taken!
Need a lazy day
As well as the QPR and Newcastle job Warbs seems to be linked with Villa? He must be a shoin for Wenger's replacement next surely?
The pace of the Championship is relentless.
9 out of 15 players out for next weekend on Fantasy League -.-
Cold pizza!👌

Saturday👌 http://t.co/L7YuKHWYZe

I feel so boring and predictable sometimes
What a joke
Feel yucky 😷
Simply couldn't care less about the Superbowl
7 players in my fantasy league are doubtful #notmyweek
Hate early breaks
Just posted a photo http://t.co/ITzTv4nTaq
Portfolio nearly done 👍
