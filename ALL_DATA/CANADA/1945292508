So I sit here in my room alone crying again wishing you were here with me and I just don't think I can do it. She kept me centered 💔😭😭
Why can't I get you off my mind... You're not coming back and I have to accept that but I fucking can't. I'm in love with you like fuck 😭💔
I'm so glad she's doing ok...
Fuck I still look at everything and everytime I read her things and it sais "single" my heart sinks 😭💔 I want her back so so badly 😭💔
What's a few more right? Just to feel something other then emotional stress and numbing pain 😭💔
She doesn't need me and shes better off with out me. It hurts like hell and it breaks my heart but why would she come back? 😔💔
1:00 in the morning and I can't sleep. All I can do is think about you. God I miss you so fucking much 😭💔
It hurts so bad but who knows what happens next week? Or next month? Idk... All I want is her to come back. Another sleepless night 😭💔
I wish she wasn't upset 😔 I wish she wasn't depressed 😔 I wish I was what's best 😔 I wish she'd just come back 😔 another sleepless night
Maybe down the road I'll be good enough but for now I'm sorry I'm not. I love you and that won't change. No matter what 😔
I wear the shirt you gave me to bed every night 😔 I miss you 😔💔
You haven't done anything? Sure you broke up with me but I dont blame you 😔
Theres literally nothing I can do.. I've lost her. And I have to give up on us for now.. that's what she wants I guess 😔
She broke up with me and her dad doesn't like me... So why do I keep hope? 😔
Girls flirting with me and telling me I'm gorgeous and yet all I see is you and all I want is you 😔
I want us back.. but it's not going to happen.. everything reminds me of her.. I justv want to get home and sleep my life away 😭💔
I hate knowing when I wake up in the morning she won't be mine 😭 fuck why did I have to be so stupid 😭 why did I have to lose her 😭💔
Don't blame yourself 😭 please... It's my fault ok? I should have been better. I was making you worse.. I'm sorry 😭💔
Well to the hospital I go -.-
I haven't stopped crying or shaking. Her parents don't like me because I have depression? So because I'm not perfect I'm not good enough? 💔
In the end they were right.. I just wasn't good enough... Just wasn't worth it 😔💔
I don't know who to trust. I've lost her and a promise I made came true.. it destroyed me.
Fuck it... Just a few more slits for relief.
Broken and numb... I've lost everything... I mean nothing so what do I do... Maybe just give up on life in general.. maybe... Maybe not
That's it... I'm nothing. I've completely lost everything... Just... In don't know what to think... Numb and broken...
I'm at the point where I just feel numb and broken. I can't even cry anymore.
Just fuck... I'm nothing... I mean nothing. So fuck myself.. if it makes her better. Then that's what's best.. even though it breaks me 😭💔
I don't need someone to talk to. I need you to talk to... No one understands me or listens to me like you do... I need you. 😭💔
😔 http://t.co/C7CC8bSyyp
I've lost all my confidence in myself... For the last week Im constantly feeling like I'm not good enough for anything. What do I do? 😔
Maybe people on ask are right... I don't want to believe it but I just don't know 😔💔
I need to talk to her and figure shit out and be happy again... But I don't think it's gonna happen 😔
I know how this is gonna end but I hope I'm wrong 😔
R.I.P Jacob... You will be missed man 😔
Have you ever missed someone so much that it hurts physically? 😔❤💔
I just want to talk to her... Hear her voice 😔😢
With her I felt on top of the world... Without her I feel like I'm drowning at the bottom of the fiery ocean in hell 😔
I'm starting to believe that her parents are what's stopping us not her 😭 why can't they allow her to make her own decisions 😔
I'm losing her.... Her parents get mad even when she texts me 😭 I don't know what to do 😭 Im slowly losing her 😭💔
I thought you were perfect and so I fell in love with you. Now I see your not and I've fallen harder.
She means more to me then anything. I fall in love with her more everyday and I don't want to be with anyone else. I better myself for you ❤
Stay strong keep smiling. She needs you to stay happy. So keep that smile on your face.
I can do this... I can pull myself out of this... I have to. Hope isn't lost yet
Fuck I can't stop shaking 😔 I need to think positive... I want her back so bad 😔
I fall harder and harder every day.. all I want is another chance 😔
Idk what I have to do but honestly I will do anything to get her back 😢😔 it hurts not having her.. Idk what to do 😔💔
I got lost in her eyes and fell in love all over again. 😔❤
That hurt so much but was worth it to see her :/ ❤
I hate when she's upset and there's nothing I can do 😔 I get a really helpless feeling 😔
I wish I could help her right now... I love you baby... Everything will be ok ❤
I wanna call and say goodnight but I can't bring myself to hit call 😔
I'm so sick of you disrespecting me like you do. You're my little sister and I love but sometimes I just wanna smack you.
It's gonna hurt a little bit not to do somethings but at least I get to see her Like a needle. It hurts a little but in the long run it help
I remember receiving this like it were yesterday 😔 gotta stay positive even when you want to cry http://t.co/jLHPgR85iP
"The truth hurts" those words haunt me and I'm afraid to know what they mean 😔
There's no better feeling then knowing she's proud and happy with what I'm doing ❤ I just hope it's all enough and helps fix us ❤
It's time to buck up. http://t.co/CkvJdRiqix
It feels good to be bucking up. And I really have you to thank for it.. so thank you. ❤
It's time for me to buck up. Off to the mall to give out resumes.
I can do this. Smile on my face. Ready for anything
If you can't I understand. I respect your space and understand. But if you can.. Please call me. And listen to what I have to say.😔
I need to talk to her. On the phone or face to face. Some way this needs to happen. If you want me to fix myself then please.. One last time
Why can't I just be good enough for her 😭 why can't I be that perfect person that she thought I was 😭
Fuck 😭 I need her so bad and at this rate I'll never get her back  😭 I have to prove I'm worth it. No more saying I want to die, I need her😭
I'm so fucking frustrated with myself. Why couldn't I just control my depression? Like fuck. I'd still a have her and be happy I'm sorry 😭😥
So I die. Who'd give a fuck for long? Every single person will get over it Sick of life. Tired of shit going bad and being helpless so pce ✌
I can't even go to timmies without crying. Everything reminds me of you and how I've lost the most important person in this world to me 😭
💔💔💔😭😭😭 http://t.co/EMDqcip0dw
If you were to ask me how many times ive thought about you ice say once. You have never left my head since we met 😞💕😢
Wake up after a dream about you...in tears again 😢
3am and I sit here crying my eyes out wishing you were here... This hurts so bad 😭 I want to call you and tell you I love you but I can't 😭
I miss those phone calls she gave me just to say goodnight 😢😞
Your arms are my bed, your voice is my blanket, and your heartbeat is the music I fall asleep to. I miss you so much 😔
Maybe this all ends soon and I get her back... Gotta stay positive and hope what's best for me is best for her too...
I'm sorry 😭 I love you 😭 I can't live like this 😭 I quit
I thought we could get through anything ... I still do.. But maybe they're right... Maybe I'm not worth it 😭 fuck why did this happen 😭
Maybe it would be better if I was gone?... Who'd care? Who'd stop me?
I can't do this. I want you back 😭 tell me how to fix this please 😭 I don't want to live with out you 😭
Idk what to do... She's the only one who can make me happy but I'm losing her more and more. 😭 why can't she call and we figure this out 😭
I've already failed her..im such a fuckup 😭😭💔
I'd be a hypocrite if I got mad at you for but please 😭💔
Fuck it... Maybe she got the right idea... What's one more?
Fuck I'm helpless and useless😭😭😭
Fuck she going to cut and there's nothing I can do 😭😭😭
When I called her last night she wanted to cry yet I made her laugh 😭 why can't the fact that we make eachother happy be enough 😭
"Baby come back to me, in need you" that's all I want to hear rn 😭💔
She can't call cuz I'll make her worse I can't call her.. She made me promise idk what to do 😭 I just want her back 😭
I had ribs for dinner and started crying.. I remembered her birthday dinner. Everything reminds me of her 😭 I just want us back. 😭
I wish you would pick up the phone, dial my number and tell me you miss me. 💔😭
I'm sorry that I can't 😭💔 http://t.co/sRxd2aZMmi
Maybe if I would have done more I'd still have her 💔😭 http://t.co/MnLxzMC3Km
I still can't stop I hope you know that 😭
I want to work this out... Talk it out... But I know it won't happen . god just fucking kill me 😭
Will we ever be happy and together again?
I sit here stair at this and cry 😭 http://t.co/E34O9DQpez
Why does she have to hurt like this. Why do I have to be the reason she's hurt.. Why can't we just be happy together again 😭💔
I'm such an idiot 😔 guess I have to deal with it wait hope and pray she comes back 😭
Yours to hold skillet

When you figure it all out I'll be right there ready to hold you... Ready to love you as I always have
I keep telling myself to stay positive but its hard when my source of positivity and motivation is gone?...
I wish I could leave but I fight.. But what if I give up. Who'll care... Who'll miss me 😞
I could be Witt Lowry 😞😭💖

Heartbreak fiction Luke Christopher 😥
Comatose by skillet explains a lot.
I can do this but I need relief Just a little bit. That's not so bad is it? Just to get through today? I have to stay positive. Thisll help.
Idk what to do I'm panicking and crying again and I have no one to run to... No where safe to hide :'(
Fake a smile so no one knows how you really feel
I hate you 😢 I try to be happy and all you do is push me and say I'm worthless. Fuck you!
Wake up by Witt Lowry 😔
Like I do and kindest regards are both amazing songs. ❤ @WittLowry I swear he's a god ❤
A lot to learn Luke Christopher
"That fireball whiskey whispers, temptation in my ear" 🎶🎶🎶
So realizing that I can't help but tweet... Lol so I'll just keep my emotions off Twitter for the most part :D :/
This will be my last tweet. Maybe forever maybe not. It's what's best for her.
I have to fix my life to get her back... I don't want her to leave.. I want her back. I wish I could be what's best for her.. I tried. Sorry
I want what's best for her so I have to say fuck how I feel... Fuck my feelings. The only way I'll get her back is if she figures this out.
I try to stay positive... Really I do. It's just so hard without you. You're my first love. You're my everything. Nothing else matters to me
She sais I'll always have a chance but what happens when you realize I don't make you happy and I'm not good enough for you? 💔😭
It's going to happen... I'm about to completely lose her 😭 it's all my fault, why do I have to be such a fuck up? I'm losing her 😭🔫💔
It hurts so bad but if its what's best for her then it has to be done. No matter how hard it hurts me 😭💔
I just want to make her happy but all I do is hurt her. It's all my fault. I'm such a fuck up 😭😭
We are on break. so why does it bug me that none of her pictures are with me 😔 Idk what to do. I want to call and talk again but I'm scared
Everything happening... It's affected me more then anyone thinks 😔 I don't even have the confidence to have my shirt off at home anymore 😔
A dream with us together happy and you were just as in love with me as I am you.. but... It was just a dream.... Reality is a scary place 😓
Fuck.. dreams of her coming into my room... Telling me she loves me 😔 please let her come back to me 😔 I miss her so much 😢
Got to hear her voice... That's all I wanted... Just missing those 3 words 😔
I wish you felt the same 😔 I don't want to lose you 😔💔 http://t.co/FHOQYc1fY5
I want to call her.. but she won't say anything back 😔
Fuck I wish I could help her and make her happy 😔 I'm an idiot and completely fucking useless to her now 😔 I'm sorry I love you 😔💔
I hate knowing she's so hurt 😭 I feel helpless 😔
She was supposed to be here today too 😔
I just wanna know what she's talking about when she said "the truth hurts"
That hurt so bad yet gave me a little relief 😔 just gotta stay positive and hope we get through this soon 😓
I'm such a fucking idiot 😭😭😭
Heartbreak fiction Luke Christopher.
I wonder if I mean anything to her anymore 😔 I try to stay positive but just Fml....
I can do this.. I need one call and I know I can do this. I can center myself and make myself better for her. But I need her help. 1 call...
I need to be positive... Maybe then she will want to come back...
I sit here and wait for her to call even though I know she won't. This is all my fault 😭
She gets better everyday. I break more everyday. I can't live like this but I don't want to hurt her or make her worse I need to hear her 😭
I need to hear her voice 😭 need her to tell me everything will be ok.I'm so useless and helpless. 😭 I just want to get through this 😭
The fact that you can sit there and laugh at my situation to my face while I bawl my eyes out makes me believe you are a horrible grandpa 😭
Fuck I can't stop 😭 I need her.. she doesn't seem to understand 😭 http://t.co/SpXKF3RVMe
