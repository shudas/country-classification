Off to the airport again to get on plane number 10 in 2 months... #airportlife #same
Drunk me is great!
Beer 10 is on hold as my battery is on 4% #Forfuckssake
Can't say how proud I am to see my friends in @heaventheaxe play at Metal Heart Festival on sat night.
Beer 9 and the blonde UK lady I was chatting too is taken #damnandblast
Doh! The 2 lovely ladies have gone :-( However a Spanish looking lovely isn't too far away!!
Oh man! Beer 7 has arrived! How did that happen??
Happy hour beer 5 has turned into non happy hour beer 6.
A 5th beer is infront of me. Summat to do with loose change, happy hour ending soon and a couple of fit ladies not far away...
I think I just saw 2 blokes kiss! #whateverfloatsyourboat #beergoggles
I now have enough change for a 5th beer lol #hatehavingloosechangeinmypocket #anyexcuse
I shall sit here with an empty glass until the twitterverse decides what I should do
Stay for more cheap beer or be sensible? #decisionsdecisions
My friends in @heaventheaxe @massiveoz &amp; @tequilabyrds I have voted for you all to open for the Crue. #cantdecide #loveyouall #motleycrue
250k's driven today, one credit card declined and lots of phone calls to uk, I'm back in Sydney for a night. Brisvegas tomozz for 2 nights!!
I fucking needed that! #chillingthefuckout
Steak, and beer on happy hour is a result in my book. Especially after driving most of the day and a bit of stress today #chillingthefuckout
I haven't heard Your Woman by White Town in years. Heard it twice today in 2 completely different places... #whatarethechances
I've never understood the phrase To Die For. Bit pointless dying for something only to not have it? Or I am missing the point? Is there one?
My case is already fit to bursting and yet still I buy more stuff! I had 4 kilos left on last flight. Getting tight now!
Fucks sake! I updated 28 apps on my phone yesterday and now I've got another 8 to update! Wouldn't mind but usually makes them worse!
Awesome to run up &amp; around Mount Panorama, Bathurst this morning followed by an icy cold spa. Run was slow,hard work! http://t.co/Fo19E4vR3A
Well if I do, that person will get the same treatment #ruthless #gameinvites #shovethemupyourarse
Well I shan't be getting invited to play Pirate Kings anymore! #seeya
Yet another invite to play Pirate Kings ffs!!
Flashy hotel but crappy wifi...
"@henryhopefrost: Shocking. Totally unacceptable race controlling. http://t.co/sJhXn6QyoJ" @TC_Remington @davejjl this is ridiculous!!

I now have a car and after a slightly stressful drive thru rush hour Sydney I'm away! #freedom
I still dont know my pin number lol
Tried twice and no go! Managed to use my aussie card somehow. Bit stressful there for a bit!
Good times at theespygram in Melbourne with my mates aidansm_  jazzalanko from massiveoz &amp;… https://t.co/TAZwDDlaUM
I love going to new places but packing my case does my head in! Where do I get all this stuff from?
I think ive remembered it...but...can't remember if I changed it to something more memorable lol! Well its narrowed down to 2 if I have!
I have a few ideas what it could be. How many goes do you get though? 3? Summat like that. Then I'm fucked!!
Ive got so much going on in my head right now I genuinely can't remember it. Too many pin numbers, dates, currencies, flights, gigs, money..
I've got about 15 hours to remember what the pin is for my uk debit card which I haven't used for 2 months, or I can't pick up my hire car!!
Few fishing boats on the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk #bondi #coogee #coastalwalk #sydney #fishing… https://t.co/7tQzf064wQ
Saw a guy today wearing a t shirt that said I Am Awesome! I felt inclined to tell him that actually he was a twat... #saywhatyousee
Lovely warm lunchtime walking around Sydney Harbour and I've just seen a penguin swimming about #surreal

Last night in a half reasonable hotel tonight.  Tomorrow I've got 3 nights in a posh hotel in Blue Mountains #whatwhat #spiffing
And yet another invite to play fucking Pirate Kings! Ffs! I'm gonna have to unfriend him aren't I?
Beer and Bruce Willis. What more do you need in life? #mancrush
Been watching a quite entertaining afl game but Die Hard 4 has just started.  #nocontest #diehard4
James Boag has popped round to keep me company whilst the footy is on #JamesBoag #premium #beer https://t.co/QIz6Ngo0Zf
I quite fancy doing the world run day thing on May 3 but I'll probably be at Cherry Bar the night before... #shitfaced #notidealpreparation

Clearly this had no effect on the person I aimed it at... #friend #unfriend http://t.co/BojVf3w0OW
The gps on my phone is great.  Unless I'm lost and really need it. In which case it turns into a total piece of useless shit. #wasteoftime
Walking thru a red light district on your way home is always interesting!
I'm prepared!! http://t.co/vsiL176Zme
Saw this on a billboard thing.  Couldn't agree more! http://t.co/DIyoRLKWXx
Watching the biggest loser whilst eating crisps and chocolate seems slightly wrong #skinnybastard
Why does my phone's apps constantly need updating? Does my head in! I've got a torch app.  Why does that need an update? Turn on, turn off!!
Totally getting into the Aussie lifestyle #arnotts #timtam #chocolate #biscuit… https://t.co/iRbhNWSyPj
Quality eye witness on @7NewsSydney  "I was asleep, heard some shots...that was it" Just as well he was there!
Up 268 metres and jumping on glass, as you do.. sydneytowereye

A GoPro and a selfie stick doesn't make you David Fucking Bailey you fucktard! #gopro #beahero #beafuckingidiot
I may have just said Out the way you fat cunt, slightly louder than I meant, in a busy McDonald's! #saywhatyoumean #shithappens #bothered
Its amazing when walking around a beautiful city on a gorgeous day, having a plaster can make or break your day. #noblisterforme
What's with the out of focus motor sport photos nowadays. Surely they're out of focus and should be deleted, not put on istagram? #shitphoto
I remembered to buy a bottle opener from the bottle shop on the way back from the strip joint I mean pub!
Clearly, I'm in a classy joint! http://t.co/MLpRjDs9f2
Drunk me is great!
4 fit blondes have just walked past me #wasntlooking #not
There are several strip clubs on the way back to my hotel #justsaying
I'm in a pub in the slightly dodgy area of Sydney, St Kilda. It's raining. If I wait too long for the rain to ease, I could be drunk.
My phone is now being charged up at least twice a day! I'm either really popular or the battery is getting worse! #samsung #shitbattery
I wouldn't say I'm totally familiar with all the rules but I can now follow an Aussie Rules game without too much confusion #AFLSwansDons
http://t.co/48gmwylu7r @TC_Remington better than Viera and Keane according to the Australians.
I could probably stay in Oz as a pro footballer judging by the standards of the Hyundai A League #MickeyMouse #quitepoor #aleague #amateurs
Early morning run from hotel to  Sydney Opera House &amp; back. The 112 steps at the end beat me though  #run #knackered http://t.co/ognjDpc6Bm
How do you politely get someone to stop inviting you to play Pirate Kings on Facebook? Its starting to get on my tits now!
False alarm! http://t.co/4ntyOCQsp0
So the fire alarm has just gone off in my hotel then.... just as well I was awake at 6:30 am
I've been reading this from the start again. I'm so proud of myself! Done some amazing things #teartomyeye #manup

If you're watching a 3d movie but close one eye, it doesn't work anymore. Film industry is really serious about cracking down on pirates!!

http://t.co/hWwUy66k4X a few words about my time with @massiveoz &amp; @tequilabyrds recently in Melbourne
http://t.co/hWwUy66k4X favourite if you read my blog please, thanks! :-)
Life right now is pretty good! #sydney #opera #house #soh #operaharbour #beer @ Sydney Opera House https://t.co/0kdkd07VJQ
Quite a few asian couples having wedding pics took with Opera House in background. Never seen that many miserable faces! #smile #BestDayEver
I think Sydney is the selfie stick capital of the world.  Or maybe its just because of all the asian tourists?
Surreal times. Messaging my friend @phoebepinnock whilst sitting on steps of Sydney Opera House, knowing I'll be in there later 2 see @train
Life is good #favouriteplace #sydney #operaharbour http://t.co/5DVpXgt6XO
Just gonna casually wander down to Sydney Opera House today and pick up my tickets for tonights Train gig, as you do #differentworld #sydney
Fan boost set to spice up Bathurst 1000 - Speedcafe http://t.co/reu5HgILTl
The view made it all worth while... #sydney #stunningview http://t.co/IiGHoWeCtH
Note to self: get bottle opener in morning. Using penknife restricts the flow of beer.  Not good. Or buy more beer with twist top caps #tool
Reckon I've earnt this today #beer #fatyak https://t.co/MucZw2ByVf
How can I be walking faster than regular people yet I'm dragging a 26 kilo suitcase and about 6 kilo in a backpack? #dawdlers #outtheway
Why is it always the ones who get on the plane last, always seem to have about 3 huge bags? They look put out as there's nowhere for it!
