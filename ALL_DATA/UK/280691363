The island is quality 👀
#KenOnTheCourse with his wee drawings, cut outs and cones 😆
A Rooney goal would be nice
Why did Chelsea sell him 🙈🔥🔥🔥
That nike ad with Tiger and Mcilroy 👏
Please be a red
Yassss
GET IN!
Budget cuts affecting everyone 😂 #kenonthecourse
Dundee United doing their best to give Caley 3rd and Caley doing their best to avoid 3rd
Waiting for Paul Merson to say united will lose this weekend!
Also not impressed booing national anthems
Games like these should be played at Tynecastle, Easter road and pitodrie #SCONIR
Worst El Classico I've seen.
Uefalona 🙉
Not offside!
Boom! Best in the world #CR7
My last RT 😂😂😂
Had Rooney anytime scorer ffs
Magnificent
HAHAHAHA
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omg
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH
Get in!
Looking at southhamptons remaining fixtures they could sneak top 4!
United actually playing like a team and look what happens!
Can't get over that willie Collum actually was allowed to go ref the bayern game last night 🙈
Hope the rumours of Depay to united are true, looked decent in the World Cup!
LOL
Willie Collum redding the wrong game tonight!
Kurt zouma gets bigger every time I see him
Great goal
Also I find it hilarious Murinho has brainwashed all the Chelsea fans claiming a campaign against them 😂😂😂
That video of Morrison and McManaman tripping up and pushing villa fans has me in stitches 😂
The reason Chelsea are so good is they buy so well compared to other team and Murinho knows how to get the best out of them
16 million was a steal for welbeck
Give it giggsy tend of season
Also knew it was a mistake selling welbeck
Lay them out @Pschmeichel1
Chrissy cucumber would have got that right ffs
WHAT
HAS TO BE
The most entertaining game I've seen United play in for a long time #MUFC
Great last few ends! #Brier2015
Great end from team Canada #Brier2015
Anyone but Jacobs #Brier2015
Some shot by Gushue to win that! #thebrier
Up £35 on roulette after 5 mins haha #thankyou
Off work for a week and don't know what time I start work tomorrow 😐
Kurt Zouma is huge! #beast
Can't see Man United getting top 4 anymore
Januzaj has been quality #mufc
Need Caley to score come on!!!
Good luck to highland u18s in tomorrow's final and the main man @HugoCrush
https://t.co/0qwmsA8Idj 😩
Celtic win tonight would make the spl more interesting
John Hughes says the wrong thing 99% of the time.
Paul Merson must have some hatred for man Utd, always tips them to lose 😂
Would appreciate if William hill let me cash out now
chris smalling is potentially one of the worst footballers I`ve ever seen
United were in desperate need of a creative midfielder now they have not 1 but 2 and yet they don't even start. #davidmoyesisafootballgenius
RVP is stealing a living playing for Man United at the moment!
Imagine locking yourself out your house without your keys and having to get a taxi to work.
Need a draw in Lyon PSG game 🙌
No coincidence that when mata doesn't play for United they create nothing! #mufc
BLIND!!!!! come on!
Decent game this has turned out to be!
Bottled it!👀
Thought wales were supposed to be good at rugby
No idea why England didn't get that try? But thank Christ they didn't!
Need a new pair of Roshes.
Jamie Redknapp doesn't think United will finish top 4 because they concede too many goals?
Only 2 teams have conceded less than United...
Hope Celtic get GMS and Armstrong, benefit Caley for Europe!
Aberdeen bottled that! 👀
I find this "campaign" against Chelsea makes for very enjoyable viewing
Excited at the prospect of Watkins up front for Caley now! #ictfc
Elastic heart by Sia 🎵
My dog has just got a tweed bed ffs...
De Gea signed a new deal 🙌
Back to the day job. 😩
Had united -1 Chelsea and crystal palace on a coupon and it wouldn't let me put it on, they all came in! #raging
Suits is back on tonight! 🐝
Blackett should have done so much better to prevent that goal
Take me out is quality!
You can't stop him! #Akinfenwa #BEASTMODE
Fabregas always has something to say to the refs no wonder he got booked for "diving"
Harry Kane is some player
Shaw would be good at football if he could beat the 1st man with his crosses.
Klopp to Newcastle 😂😂😂
This ref is having one! #TOTMUN
American sniper looks class!
Shoulder is in bits 👎
Sportscene is dreadful!
#SPOTY has gone downhill very quickly!
Basel's passing is superb!!
Finally united getting some results going!
Surprised Forster didn't save that with his jaw.
You know united are having a bad game when Ashley young has been the best player
Aye sound ref I'll just headbutt felliani
Graeme shinnie wouldn't have setup Rooney ....
Huge result!
Calvin Harris outside! Wow 💃
