so far 2015 has made me realise that only one down for me is me
staying strong is the hardest thing
if you can't choose between me and someone else, pick them.

them ones when a side bitch mocks other side bitches for being side bitches
i swear some people live to involve themselves in beef
not everyone is meant to stay in your life. some are just there to help shape you into the person you're meant to become
sometimes you gotta fuck up to see who's real

the sad moment when you realize you never fucked with a real nigga, it was just lame after lame
i don't understand how you can go through life without having matured
some people seriously need to realise their priorities
