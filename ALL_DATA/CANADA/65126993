Clarifying "not your vet" for all &amp; @Sweetbonana. Vets are a crucial part of pet's life but good food prevents many medical probs #petchat
Buy superior quality food for your pet! Put your money into your pet, not your vet, as they say. No offence @Sweetbonana? üòè #petchat
Exercise &amp; activity is best for weight management but a lower caloric &amp; lower fat content food helps too #multimenu #petchat
