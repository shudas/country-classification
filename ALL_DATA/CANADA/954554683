Shitty thing of having a party at your place is having to clean up after it... My party was Friday, and it's now Monday.. #stillnotclean
Watching USA cheerleading makes me happy but makes me sad cause I miss it so much #truestory

Being rude and ignorant while your in school to work with children is great role modeling. 👍 #inappropriatebehaviour

Way to excited for Placement tmrw!!!! #toddlers
The amount of homework you get in college is ridiculous 😩
showers are amazing. they make you feel nice and clean, make you sound like a professional singer and help you make all of life's decisions
So many fake people in this world
Forehead kisses are my favorite 😊
I love food but I don't like dishes
Literally kicking the 2faced/fake friends out of my life and replacing them with genuine/caring ones. 👋
Placement with toddlers this semester !!! This should be fun 🙆 #SoExcited
First day and I'm already overwhelmed... But I am excited ... But mostly overwhelmed 😰
This world is truly a scary place if you think about it... #thoughts

It disgusted me how childish and how cruel you are to people. You think it's funny but it really isn't. I feel ashamed to even no you tbh.
Hedgehogs aren’t pets; they’re “quill kids.”
It's stupid how much I love cranberries with salt.... #imweird
