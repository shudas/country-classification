Summer is right around the corner which means I'll soon be blowing the doors off my car pumping Clean Bandit. #ToeTappingGoodTime
Heartbreaking to hear about Mark Reeds this morning. Go Sens Go

Pretty soon we are going to use GIFs to communicate.
2 for 4 on getting me home early! @WestJet don't know how you guys do it.
Excuse me. I'm an adult. I should be able to decide how drunk I would like to be on an airplane.
Welcome to the #Canucks @j_markstrom where the games are made up and the saves don't matter.
Since Benning treated last year's off season like a trade deadline I doubt @VanCanucks will make any huge moves. #TradeCentre
Landed in #yyc Do you think that they're pissed they are only one letter off from being a rush song? #yyz
My plane landed 30 mins early! Thanks @WestJet! Managed to find time for a coffee before my connection.
I don't think I've ever been getting ready for a flight and not sang "Leaving on a jet plane"
Heart breaker there @Raptors. Get @Klow7 back in the line up and we'll get Em next time.

Nothing brings me joy like a new episode of @LastWeekTonight. Kudos for a great program @iamjohnoliver!
If 23 Jump Street doesn't have Michael Jordan I'm not watching it.
Sometimes I'll show up for work 15 mins early to show I'm dedicated but then I remember that most of the fight scenes in Rocky are real...
