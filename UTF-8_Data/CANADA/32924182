Despite the massive challenges facing #tbay, the mayoral debate was about whether to build a building. #municipalelection2014
Colin Burridge thinks he is Harvey Dent and that TBay is Gotham. #tbaydebates #TBay
Shane Judge's platform: don't build the event centre. #MayoralDebateTbay #tbay
3 out of the 6 of the mayoral candidates used the #colbert line "I don't even see race" to explain how to combat racism. #MayoralDebateTbay
Colin Burridge answer to any problem: ignore it! Racism, ignore it! Abuse, ignore it! #fail #tbay #municipalelection2014
Lisa Laco is consistently asking the smart and pertinent questions. @morningshowlisa @CBCTBay #municipalelection2014 #TBay
"We are isolated so we can block roads." Answer to what can we do about Ebola in Thunder Bay. Brilliant!  #municipalelection2014 #tbay
Game changer question from the floor: Ebola! Amazing. #municipalelection2014 #tbay
Many platitudes not much substance at the mayoral debate. #municipalelection2014 #tbay
Not one good answer to "what image does/should portray to the rest of Canada/the world" it's worrisome. #tbay #municipalelection2014
Thank you for getting the debate back onto issues and not rinks! @morningshowlisa
40 minutes into the #tbay mayoral debate and all they can talk about is an ice rink. Time to move on lads.
TBay mayoral debate: a place to yell incoherently from the audience.
Hobbs seems to be the only one who will champion the events centre. #TBay
Shane Judge's main election plank seems to be only about killing the downtown event centre. #tbay
