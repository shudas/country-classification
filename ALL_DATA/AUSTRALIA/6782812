Seeing these plaques on boring office blocks is fairly depressing. I'd almost rather we forgot. @ Hay‚Ä¶ https://t.co/VmL63C60Fw
Indonesia has saved 200 of its citizens from execution since 2011, a world-beating effort.
Caution - this article about Jokowi lobbying to save Indo citizens on death row overseas may infuriate you http://t.co/82cgbec4Sl
Very excited about @srasko‚Äôs Barry nomination - and @luisaomielan whose show was probably the best of the dozen I saw #MICF2015
Some of us got on the anti-Leunig bus earlier than others... https://t.co/q34rxQKzVh
Just read a newspaper. Felt totally hipster. Maybe they could save print by marketing it as artisanal news?
Perhaps demolishing heritage buildings should be made a criminal offence? Even a hefty fine can be budgeted for http://t.co/PJNZryQBHt
So glad I was inoculated against Leunig at a young age.
Repeat after me: Anzac Day is not a marketing opportunity.
I want to write a defence of Fast &amp; Furious 7 but don‚Äôt have a more sophisticated argument than ‚Äúbut it was awesome‚Äù. 

But it was awesome.
He wasn‚Äôt trying to, but @karlkwin just listed all the reasons why Fast &amp; Furious 7 is awesome üöò http://t.co/tIR91Q3GK9 h/t @DonnieMountjoy

‚Äú@sensitivefetus: .@HillaryClinton http://t.co/GXyVvvIcOS‚Äù Outstanding Clinton trolling. Ping @JamColley
I know Americans are getting excited about #Hillary but might I remind you that we Aussies kind of elected a female leader way back in 2010
So Hillary is running for Khaleesi, right?
Okay so that scene went down very differently from the last time they were in this Sept #GameOfThrones
Young Cersei! Was just as nasty as old Cersei #GameofThrones

Winter is coming is here or something #GameofThrones
Here‚Äôs a warning for violence and nudity. WELCOME BACK #GameOfThrones!!!
I‚Äôm going to tweet #GameofThrones in a considerate, spoiler-free way. But others may not, so maybe mute it?
I can barely remember the complexities of A Song Of Ice And Fire, and now the TV series is veering off in its own direction? Mind=exploded
Thank goodness our world no longer endures the archaic feudalism depicted in #GameOfThrones. Bring on Clinton v Bush 2016!
I concur with the SMH that Charles Waterstreet‚Äôs columns are far too special to ruin with tedious proofreading. Who is funny now!
Don‚Äôt worry, @Hillaryclinton. @Wikileaks stole that whole hourglass thing from Days Of Our Lives.
Hillary Clinton deciding to run was approximately as inevitable as Joe Biden deciding he won‚Äôt.
It's not often you can see the Opera House from the opera @ Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour https://t.co/CiPPjYf504

I don‚Äôt see why the public needs to see photos of bereaved people crying. Always intrusive and crass.

Is there really a market for Coke with 1/3 less sugar, so it‚Äôs only awful for you as opposed to absolutely terrible?
Definitely don't see how these watches are worth dozens of times more than the base model. @ Apple Store https://t.co/tw1cEKYvfQ
I guess I like that iOS 8.3 introduces emoji with different skin tones - but I‚Äôm certainly not going to be selecting the white ones!
Sad to hear of @angelacatterns‚Äô exit from 2UE. An extraordinary broadcaster and a generous colleague.

The Dracula *I* know certainly wouldn‚Äôt advertise his terrifying presence by opening a theatre restaurant in Melbourne.
Richie Benaud lived in a quiet, fairly modest Coogee building for years. My brother met him at the apt‚Äôs Xmas drinks! http://t.co/hZkgIXHOzf
Lovely tribute to Richie Benaud by another Richy, @rgcooke http://t.co/4mu7D4ipYj
Richie Benaud was, simply put, marvellous.
I so love the Kids‚Äô Quiz. Starting to suspect that there should be a talkback show for kids that‚Äôs on all the time‚Ä¶
Serious question: what‚Äôs a song 8-14yos are into? Got to find a track to intro the kids‚Äô quiz!
I have Penny‚Äôs theme from Inspector Gadget stuck in my head.
So according to the #Melbourne four seasons in one day theory, it‚Äôll stop raining and start being lovely any moment now, right? Right?
Who are the tattoo artists going ‚Äúyeah, look, happy to give you a swastika tatt‚Äù? Actually I guess you can prob tell them by their own ones.
Tonight I‚Äôm going to celebrate my last night off work by sitting in a bar. And doing some accounting, but at least I‚Äôll be in a bar.
Also, after seeing The Rock in action, I clearly need to eat more cod. #fastfurious7
Fast &amp; Furious 7 is one of the greatest action films I‚Äôve ever seen. So many wonderful actors, all with good stuff to do. And the ending‚Ä¶
‚Äú@TheNewDailyAu: Would you zap your kids with an electrical current to get better academic results?‚Äù seems easier to send them to Scots‚Ä¶

In half an hour, we‚Äôll all relive this hour. Is there some time convention for telling them apart? 2am AEDT vs AEST?
BLOOD MOON kinda @ City of Melbourne https://t.co/qFJGQeCcUf
It‚Äôs the little differences between Sydney and Melbourne, you know? Like the number of waxed moustaches. #MICF2015
Such a great @micomfestival night last night! @genfricker + @jenkirkman + @luisaomielan + @watsoncomedian‚Äôs Comedywealth Games. Get along!
As ever, nobody gets a room invested in a frivolous game like @watsoncomedian. Comedywealth Games was so much fun at @micomfestival tonight!

So happy to be back in Melbourne for the Comedy Festival over Easter! @ Portland Hotel https://t.co/ADhc0sr1UY

Hey, Melbourne - what‚Äôs the early buzz on @micomfestival shows? What mustn‚Äôt I miss on pain of eternal regret? #MICF2015
Condolences to NZ, who will more than get us back at the Rugby World Cup. #CWC15
2 runs required off 17 overs. THIS IS SO NAILBITING I CAN BARELY WATCH #CWC15
Smith should hit the winning runs here. And Watto should watch. #CWC15
