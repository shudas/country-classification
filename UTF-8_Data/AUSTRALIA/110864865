Alex G &amp; Clover will keep pushing  late night violent economy agenda - no matter what stats you hit them over the head with #KingsCross
Like as if the female who doesn't have to get her husband to walk her to work on weekends really cares as to "Why is this so?"

#KingsCross
Like as if the lady who doesn't have 2 clean down her steps every Sat &amp; Sun morning of spew, etc is really concerned as to why? #KingsCross
2/2 Do you know what Alex -

#KingsCross residents don't give a flying fig ---- they just know residential environment is gr8. Keep lockouts

http://t.co/wL0B7zSzqW
Instead of accepting evidence based HTV Alex &amp; Clover tried 2 shut down #TeamOrange handing out HTV cards on election day #nswvotes #Sydney
#TeamOrange told voters Alex Greenwich's constant calls 4 early review= misplaced &amp; thus he No 6 on HTV #nswvotes http://t.co/CZdvgFkNix
It is quite clear from #BOSCAR media release that Alex Greenwich's constant calls for an early review been entirely misplaced.

His image is created by slick advertising &amp; film but the reality is something quite different? #nswvotes  https://t.co/0PCQP7R17P
Correct. I don't know why what #TeamOrange was doing brought such a hostile reaction from Clover &amp; Alex #nswvotes  https://t.co/zwf1d059X0
I spoke to her at 5pm. I don't know how long she had been telling the porky. All day? What effect on result?  https://t.co/1na4ufX8Ol

Lack of transparency and openness is a blight on democracy. Why hide it? https://t.co/kyjSBnV6wk
We must keep the lockouts and earlier closing in a highly populated residential area. Greenwich &amp; Clover want late nite trading. Why?
#TeamOrange objective was to put Lockouts on the agenda. Got attacked by Alex Greenwich &amp; supporters for doing so. https://t.co/gVlCCgHDJ9
