I will do this on my own.
I don't need anyone
I'm going back into the attic after I go to the restroom
Now I hear weird noises in the attic but I think it's just the mouse in the walls or wherever mice roam around
Now I'm in the attic looking for the book.
And my mother has a 'book' that her grandfather owned.
My mother's grandfather  was part of, Freemasonry. I'm shocked. And he would go to a meeting every Friday night. He was secretive.
And when he died, 'people' attended his funeral.
I made pumpkin pancakes for breakfast from Trader Joe's
