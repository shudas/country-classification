Embarrassing @OHLBarrieColts fans shouting out during the national anthem ... Disrespectful ... Not @OHLBattalion fan quality
Love the fan salute by the @OHLBattalion in Barrie
Feel bad for @BuffaloSabres coaching staff. Nolan didn't trade away every good player they had so the Sabres could draft @cmcdavid97
What a goal by @heatz89 ... He was looking determined that whole shift. @OHLBattalion up 2-0 late in the 1st period
Bernier with his 2nd assist of the night, brings the @CanadiensMTL back on par with the @MapleLeafs. #StayInTheNet #Giveaway #TMLtalk
Is there a connection between final @OHLBattalion draft pick @curtisabbott16 and the Troops owner Scott Abbott ???
Back in time ... Alex Daigle selected in the 2015 #OHLDraft ... Didn't go 1st overall this time
2 weeks ago @SBennett93 was being dominated by the @OHLBattalion, and now he's playing his 1st @NHL game. #Overmatched #NotReady
Hoping @CoachStanButler selects #PowerForward @veleke77 in the #OHLDraft #12thRound. 6'6", 221 lbs ...
Instant chemistry if the @OHLBattalion can convince @jmani_18 to join fellow @shattuckstmarys d-man @b_lyle22 in North Bay #OHLDraft
Looking through the @OHLHockey #DraftGuide. Some pretty big boys left. Wouldn't mind seeing @veleke77 join the @OHLBattalion #PowerForward
Congrats to North Bay native @bengaragan on being selected in the 5th rd of the #OHLDraft. Too bad it's to rival @Sudbury_Wolves
Just caught up on Twitter. @MatthewSookram noticed you left Gomes off the @OHLBattalion returning list. Was that intentional?
Kinda surprised that the @GoLondonKnights haven't tried to eliminate the top players on @ErieOtters as retribution for Domi &amp; Marner

Great job @OHLBattalion ... Big win to take a 3-0 series lead over the @KingstonFronts ... Didn't breathe that whole 3rd period
Undertaker coming out to blue skies just doesn't seem right. #WrestleMania #fail
The #YesMovement is in full effect. Congrats @WWEDanielBryan #InterContinentalChampion. Thought @HEELZiggler had it #WrestleMania
Love that @SBennett93 takes cheap shot on @miles_liberati and regrets it immediately after. Good job Miles
Been a while since we've seen that kind of physical play. Near line brawl for the @OHLBattalion.
Personal observation ... Bennett has looked disinterested and just going through motions in this @OHLBattalion vs @KingstonFronts game
I hope the @MapleLeafs just put the 1st nail in the @Senators playoff coffins! Puts a big smile on this Leafs fans face #TMLtalk
