debating on just staying my ass home tomorrow .
I feel like I'm stuck in this spot
nothing more , nothing less
something always comes up to ruin my birthday like every year .
it's not really a surprise though knowing my luck ...
I'm an emotional wreck .
days just keep getting shittier &amp; shittier
tired af
lying is so pointless ... I'll find out later on anyways .

honestly people always start to care when it's too late
what to do what to do
&amp; everyone beginning to fall asleep but me 😭😭
I hate when I'm laying in bed &amp; my phone has to be on the charger so I'm laying in like a really awkward position ...
iono why you favorite my stuff when you don't even follow me 😴
I am a horrible texter &amp; I apologize for that
I honestly hardly reply to my dms .. so if I do reply you should feel really special
I'm gonna have a great time waking up tomorrow .... can't wait
If I receive 15 booty pics on Friday I will automatically have a great day 😊
hoping this party will be a success &amp; I'll have a fun ass night w a bunch of fun ass people &amp; make some fun ass memories
