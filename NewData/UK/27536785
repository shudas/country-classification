Drinks at the ready with @erinlorimer  Welcome To Glasgow @ollyofficial #NeverBeenBetterTour
Nufc are so bad right now I've heard that children are scared to answer the door incase it's Shearer trying to give them ticket to the game
As for the planned boycott vs @THFC_Spurs is it gonna make a difference..be careful what you wish for. Someone has to come in before MA Goes
Fed up with people saying it's not JC's fault..five defeats in a row and honestly can't see where the next draw is coming from let alone win
Another game, another defeat, Demoralising,Dreadful,Damaging &amp; if we're not careful we will get dragged into the danger zone #Enough #nufc
Congratulations @JordanSpieth US Masters Champion 2015,Got out on front and Never looked back #Champ #USMasters2015 http://t.co/5iBkzDRRvf
Don't get me wrong, I love that JC has a love of the club, fans &amp; the city is one to be applauded,but he should NOT be in charge of #nufc
If John Carver felt bad last week he must feel 10x worse...@CPFC showing how easy it is to beat @SunderlandAFC #GutlessUnited
So @ITV (Allegedly) new sports quiz made its debut and definitely not a copy of @QuestionofSport &amp; @ALOTO, @BradleyWalshJP2 best thing on it
