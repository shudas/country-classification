Live, travel, adventure, bless and don't be sorry...! - Jack Kerouac
To love honestly
To love openly
To love entirely
Love is
To love unconditionally
To love me
Using lies
Leaving me torn
And empty inside
Today is one of those days
You know...
Those days that suck....
Those days i don't get
To see her beautiful smile
To bathe in her eyes
Face value
What you see
Is what you get
Thats all i am
Thats what i believe
Thats how i see
Don't tell me lies
I will often believe
So close to her
To be able to
Taste her love
Always leaving
Wondering
What might
Have become
http://t.co/7T9Sg81e7u via @youtube
In her heart
I feel complete
In her mind
I feel at ease
In her soul
I found a mate
In her smile
I want to stay
To dream
Of her smile.....
I don't ever
Want to forget
To taste her fire
The deepest desires
Her dreams and hopes
I strive to please
I love your sharp corners
I love your jagged edges
I love your cares
I love your less
I love your small things
I love your curves
I love you
I want 
To discover
All your perfect flaws
I want
To touch all your scars
I want
To heal all your tears
Goddamn you're beautiful
I want 
You
Eveything in my
Life is faded
Her life
Her smile
Her soul
Makes me glow
Her hearts rhythm
My soul's companion

#sixwords
Wasted on her love
Entranced by her life
Lost in her smile
Desperately seeking
To be the one
She lives to love
over the hills and thru the valleys i went...up the hill i must now go....late at night before i'm back home http://t.co/zeQiwRAXqZ
Caught between
The land of the living
And
Being alive
Destiny
Do me a favour
Stay out of my
Life
Striving to be
Something
Different
Always being
Another
Fool 
In the
Crowd
To always be
Unlucky with love
Must also mean
I'm unloveable
Her touch
Kisses my
Dark away

#sixwords
Her spark
Lights
My brightest days

#sixwords
Even when
The whole world
Is in front of me
I would turn
My back on them
To just 
Look
At you
Brought back to
Life
By her smile
I wait for a day
When the salvation
Of love
Will free me
From my 
Mortal cage
When her river
Runs dry
She will return
To scene
Of her crime
Don't shed tears
For a future
That could've been
Abandon your fears
And tell me
How you really feel
I often feel
Like a scratching pole...
To be used
Beat up
Played with until
Ragged and frayed....
Then tossed out
Just thrown away
A green heart....
Friends
or
Jealousy....
Doesn't matter
They both mean
She doesn't
Love me
To want
What you want
To grab
What you desire
To be
With the one
That makes you 
Feel gr8
To know
You are loved
Life 
Only comes
Around once
Someday
Oneday
Maybe
I will be
Someone's
One
That will keep me busy for a while...just put them on repeat and dream away.

If i'm dead to you
So be it....
Maybe next time
With your next guy
You try 
To use a bit
More honesty
Before it
Gets to this point
At least i can
Stand proud
Knowing 
I was 
Upfront
and
Honest
With you
From the start
I want to feel
The weight
Of your head
On my arm
As you sleep
And dream sweetly
Of how much 
I love you
It is up to you....
I dont play
Dr jeckell 
Mr hyde
Games....
Goodnight...
Hopefully tmrw
U will be strong
Enough to let me
Into ur heart...
I wld luv to send 
You a goodnight flower..
Only if u want it
Aaaahhh....the thought of 
Your smile.....
Triggering the
Release
Of the thousands
Of butterflies
You have put
Inside me
Be brave
Beautiful smile
Of mine
I feel like
I dream my 
life away
I wait for her
To tell me herself
How strong we
Might get
If my love
She will accept

Another invite to run a workshop for a Cambridge college on paranormal investigating , liking all these requests
Just driven to a remote aboriginal township, amazing atmosphere there and so many stories told ...oh and a beach to die for
There are some amazing spirits walking around Kuranda
Relaxing day today then tomorrow off to Kuranda to see what spirits it has to offer
Today was mostly spent crabbing
Next week I will be wandering around an area where there were fierce tribal battles hoping I can pick up on something
All good here the cyclone missed us so let's get back to some investigations
At the moment the cyclone is heading north of Cairns so fingers crossed .
Think I could get use to eating fresh mangoes every night
Good chance I will be offline for a few days as the cyclone passes through
We are now on cyclone watch , this could get interesting
Not looking too good for Thursday and Friday http://t.co/XM0ujcgiBq
Looks ok until Thursday but the forecast is for tropical cyclone Nathan to hit again  , our apartment is rated as cat 5 safe so will see
Nice walk round one of the older buildings in Cairns today , plenty going on in there but a reluctance to come forward
Hoping to get out to the site of a big mining disaster next week just as long as the cyclone doesn't come back in
And there was us thinking it was going away http://t.co/zbzMwlBh86
Mental ride up the cairns inlet today http://t.co/fytWYQF7Vj
237mm in 24 hours .....bit wet
Cyclone moving away at last , should be able to get out more soon
All 3 cyclones , we are watching the one in the middle http://t.co/5MhO48CgUA
Drove up the gillies highway today , bends and sheer drops...amazing road http://t.co/qy5CEy3gzo
Next week it's a visit to where there was a Big battle between tribes and where there was a big mining disaster
My hire car in OZ http://t.co/q75OiTdbYq
Looks like there's a storm on the way
Arrived in Cairns, just get through the jet lag again then we can start some invos
Soon be time to head to Hong Kong airport and fly to cairns
Crowne Plaza hotel East Kowloon the most  friendliest and helpful hotel we have stayed in ...and we stay in a lot
Thursday I will be on the hunt for a good trail camera which should be a lot cheaper here than in the uk
Walk round the Bay Area tomorrow see if I can pick anything up in the way of spirits
Room is on the 45th floor http://t.co/hBjACY1OZz
My suitcase got damaged in transit , Cathay pacific are fantastic and gave me money to buy a new one straight away
In London ready for tomorrow's flight to HK
Wonder if that cyclone forming in the coral sea will track towards cairns while we are there
Batteries out and all equipment stored until I get back from the trip at the end of April,will just be using my senses and a camera for now
Write up in the Cambridge evening news following Saturdays investigation at the museum of technology
Got a call from a film crew this morning ....same old rubbish ideas ....no thanks
Lots of media interest in local paranormal teams lately , and some interesting questions being asked
Got a lot of requests from locals to attend the next investigation at the museum , could be interesting having some first timers there
That's all the UK investigations done until May...next stop Hong Kong
Great invo at the museum last night, full appRitions, chains being thrown and Equipment going mental
Soon be time to head off to The Cambridge Museum of Technology for tonight's invo ....well I say soon it's only a ten minute drive
Area where there was a big mining disaster just outside Cairns Australia to investigate while I'm out there in about 4 weeks time
Looking forward to seeing what equipment I can pick up cheap in Hong Kong in a couple of weeks
