Kind of disappointed that there wasn't even a hint of romance with Kyoko, or between any of the students. #Danganronpa
That's Danganronpa finished. Now to get back to P4G.

Pretty lame.
Never liked Mortal Kombat as a game but the Fatalities are cool as shit.

Liked that first episode of Daredevil. Will watch more later.
Now watching Daredevil.

Was surprised to hear AKB48 in those ending credits for Wreck It Ralph.
Wreck It Ralph is so good.
"O-re-o! Oreeeeeeeeeeeeee-o!" I fucking lost it. #WreckItRalph
I love this movie already. #WreckItRalph
Starting to build my list of TV shows to watch on Netflix. Suggestions welcome. http://t.co/LsjOKMENPV
I'll ask again, do any of my followers have GTAV for PC/Steam?
So GTAV is buggy as hell, as expected.
Daredevil looks decent. Will give it a watch.

For me, communication needs to be in text or face-to-face.
It's probably connected to my dislike of phones.
I talk to total strangers face-to-face almost everyday, yet I'm still so socially awkward that talking to random people in games scares me.
Any of my followers have GTAV on Steam/PC?
Just tried a benchmark test on GTAV and then after a few minutes I suddenly got a mission failed screen. The fuck?

For a self-proclaimed elite, Byakuya does very little in Class Trials. It's always Kyoko and Makoto doing all the thinking. #Danganronpa
I hate Yasuhiro. #Danganronpa
Not long until the PC release of GTAV.
Also don't like how vague and difficult to make out some options are for Final Argument. #Danganronpa
Kind of annoying that you can't review or look at at evidence/Truth Bullets during trials like in Ace Attorney. #Danganronpa
It was only a Mata of time.
3-0 Rangers. Wahey!
Joe Hart is crap.
Game on.
Hoping for a good Manchester derby. Not really bothered about the result but I want entertainment.

Throwing objects at football players is assault and the trademark of a cunt.
I really hope we sign Vuckic. He's been a breath of fresh air. #RFC
Get in there Vuckic! #RFC
Late goal is karma for playing shit all season then suddenly trying to play well when you're about to be relegated. Get fucked, QPR.
GET IN! #CFC
Thank fuck. Well done Cesc. #CFC
Are Hazard and Courtois literally the only Chelsea players that actually care?
GET IN THERE NICKY CLARK
"If you hate Chelsea stand up" What a bunch of wallopers QPR supporters are.
QPR supporters are a bunch of children. Booing like they're watching a pantomime.
MON THE CHELSEA

Supervisors still haven't phoned me. I'm going to be angry if I go into work and find there's nothing for me to do for hours.
I would try to increase my friendship with Sayaka too if it weren't for...y'know...
Playing Danganronpa. Trying to increase my friendship with Kyoko, Aoi and Celeste. I'm so simple. &gt;_&gt;
I'm quite surprised I'm finding myself enjoying a JC Staff anime.
Shokugeki no Souma is great. Loving it already.

Sitting waiting on a customer getting back to their flat. Good thing I've got 30 minutes to spare.
Someone at work forgot to phone me about coming in later so I'm stuck doing nothing until 6pm. Urgh.
ZETSUBOUSHITA! WORKING HAS LEFT ME IN DESPAIR!
Go to go to work in 10 minutes. I'm in despair. http://t.co/XI3Am4BTEC
I've only had my Wii U for 6 months, dammit.
It's only been 2.5 years and already Nintendo are starting the development of a new console.
All this talk of NX recently is making me mad I even bought a Wii U in the first place.
Or maybe he's just beginning to hate himself. #OreGaIruZoku
I'm beginning to wonder if Hachiman is beginning to hate his own methods with that inner monologue at the end of the episode. #OreGaIruZoku
Why can't I hold all this Hestia fanart?
