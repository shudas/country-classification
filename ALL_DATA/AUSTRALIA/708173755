Anyone been to Japan? Any recommendations for things to do, particularly in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto during spring?
Can't wait to see Sicily play today. Really think he can become a star at AFL level. Tremendous talent #aflbombershawks
If you're a fan of @BillSimmons trade value column, I've got a 2013 draft revisited piece coming soon on @Bound4GloryNews . *expecting heat*
West coast... Just starting to create a buffer
Helped out my old mate @MatthewSLodge for an afl academy scouting report for @NBluesFC. Here's who to watch for: http://t.co/UNT8siUS7v
Top 5 bolters to keep an eye on in the #AFLDraft at the moment - Gresham, Fiorini, Hopper, A.Francis, Crocker, Hardwick,
Got a question about the draft or any potential draftees? Hit me up and use #BFGNDraft
Nothing makes me happier than seeing Mitch Clarke do well. #AFLHawksCats
Darcy lang's composure and aggression is very pleasing. He's a real sneaky great pick for the Cats
Interesting insight from Gunston regarding the different grass surface from players returning from LTI's. Could be an interesting storyline
like I need to be Chris Paul the GM so I can fire doc the GM and bring in Iman Shumpert and 2013 Carl Landry
NBA 2K needs a Lebron GM mode, where you average a triple double and blow up the roster at will
Not sure this draft has great depth, but I will there's about 7 different players who could challenge for number one. #afldraft
Need a good friday footy fix? I've ranked the top 20 in-form players in the @TACCup ! Tell me your thoughts/questions http://t.co/5s157Cq78C
Tyreke Evans deserves some love. Absolutely balling right now
First time ever I've had all group members turn up for meetings two weeks in a row #insane
Zaza pachulia had 22, 21 (18 offensive boards!!!) 7 dimes and a steal! ZAZA PACHULIA
How good is Salem's kicking! That 30 metre gallop then the perfectly weighted pass to Viney was incredible
I think we might have seen two consecutive super drafts... Not so sold on this one at this early stage #afldraft
Can't believe I'm saying this, but big Sean's album might be a lot better than kendricks. How???
First @TACCup podcast for the year tonight with @paigecardona and @pawil5 ! Will keep you all updated with the details.
Number one search string on @Bound4GloryNews is Kyle Langford. I profiled him in early June last year. High ceiling http://t.co/Ikwhymr6Al
Rated Langford in my top 10 talents last year. Not surprised by his performance, but gee he's put on strength quickly!
Making my debut behind the scenes of #firstbounce tomorrow! Live from 7-9am on the AFL app and website, check it out. #firstgamer
Having the most unbelievable luck over the past two days! Really excited to learn from the best at afl media and sen!
Bring back Damien martyn I say #CWC15
Aaron Heppell officially named as a bombers too up player among 12 others http://t.co/bCskR7d4eG
Breaking down Russell westbrooks February by the all time stats. 86% total usage rate http://t.co/gvcECkZptK
Rip Anthony mason. Wonderful player in his day and his passing was far too early
And with this one solid game the Knicks will sign bargs to a max deal
Just sent my first job application to http://t.co/41y3JKL6Au. Nervous as you can be
‚ÄúThe Bombers have the chance to show off another Heppell in the NAB Challenge. http://t.co/bCskR7d4eG‚Äù

Aaron Heppell has tons of potential
Back in for @SENAmerica with a complete wrap up of all today's nba trades http://t.co/hg4pBrIfaE
Gee I don't have a good feeling about the heat mortgaging their house on four 30+ players. Stinks of a Knicks/nets playoff run
Houston did some very sneaky work landing kj and Pablo for essentially nothing
Abc 2 running with inbetweeners then arrested development. Get around it
Not sure there's been many better scenes than Neil punching the fish in the inbetweeners #fiestyoneyouare
.@cpetracca7 missing the season is heartbreaking. Would have taken the rising star medal home in a canter #getwellsoon
Just copped a maroon five no zach lavine
ZAAAAAACH
Dr j didn't even look mildly enthused
ZACH
Not bad vic
Been at work since 5am! If you're down near Elwood today come visit me at the @flyactive marquee at Elwood park!
Hazlewood... More like hazlegood #boraphil #AUSvIND
Check out the top 15 afl draft prospects for 2015. http://t.co/0Lr7fc50Vp #onboardthekeaystrain #afldraft
Swaggy is FEELING it
Nothing more nerve wracking than sitting in the dentists waiting room, hearing the drill work over time #saveme
Madison square garden is exploding. What a game! #knicksvsblazers
Tim hardaway üí∏üí∏üí∏
Anyone know any good, cheap dentists around the eastern suburbs?
STAT starting at centre today. Melo at the four perhaps?
Bit disappointed that tom wilkinson and garrett mcdonagh didn't get picked up as rookies. Really talented kids #alwaysnextyear
tigers have done really well in taking jay short and Jason castagna. Both excellent kicks. Jayden short a kared Polec type #class
If this draft period shows one thing, it's how important the academies are. Congratulations @aflnswact , 12 recruits!
Tyler kietel again overlooked. Just not dominant enough as a key forward for mine.
Brisbane, Richmond and Carlton the big winners from the rookie draft in my books.
Top 10 rookie choices 
1. Cavarra 
2. Wilkinson 
3. Kietel 
4. Castagna
5. Glenn 
6.fordham 
7. Mclaren 
8. Ramsay 
9. Short 
10. Gowers
Ayyye got tickets to drake and tity boi. So keen
Kyrie is just money today. Pull ups, step backs, the works
Nothing more spectacular than watching someone play when they are in god mode. LeBron James is locked in today
You'll be pleased to know the shirt has made another appearance @MatthewSLodge @C_Filippo23 http://t.co/JRfYjX9lOr
Knocked off work early. Instead of getting a good nights sleep for once I've ended up dedicating the next four hours to house of cards
How can JR be so horrible then hit that clutch shot. Hurts my heart
Why haven't the Knicks used an amare- Jose pick and roll? It's unstoppable
Even if we lose, Jose Calderon should still be renamed Jose goderon
Monta ellis is so underrated
Pablo number four!
Calderon 9 points, 3/3 from the arc and 5 boards in the first six minutes #knickstape
Jose Calderon is just money üí∏üí∏üí∏
Can't see the suns gambling on Duggan to slide to 15. Can't miss prospect, although wright has much more upside #AFLDraft
Adelaide massively into Reece Mckenzie with their third pick. Tigers, hawks and saints also interested #slideralert
It's quite conceivable that Adelaide pick up d.mckenzie and b.maynard. Adding toughness, class and versatility with both picks. #afldraft
For fans whose clubs are interested in dan Mckenzie: courageous, great overhead, impeccable kick. Half back and midfield. Luke Hodge clone
11. Laverde 
12. Ellis 
13. Lever 
14. Durdin 
15. Langford 
16. Cockatoo 
17. Weller 
18. Heeney
19. Lamb 
20. Miller
1. Mccartin
2.petracca 
3. Brayshaw 
4.pickett
5. De Goey
6. Goddard
7. Ahern
8. Duggan 
9. Moore
10. Wright
Fwiw, if the pies take de goey at 5, there's a huge chance weller can make it to pick 17. #slideralert #afldraft
