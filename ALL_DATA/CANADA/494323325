To do a moral inventory of friends &amp; loved ones, speak truth to them! Those that live a lie will be offended and leave! #DeezTherapistLogic
Dancing is a conversation between two people... talk to me!  😘💋
Gossip, insecurity, &amp; angry people all require my reaction to have power. Sorry I'm to busy living my fab life to worry bout your sad one 👊💋
Don't let my silence and lack of reaction fool you! Ur Insecurity and stupidity is loud and clear &amp; hun U don't deserve my energy! #carryon
The venom others spit is a reflection of their true self, your reaction is a reflection yours! #choosewisely #DeezTherapistLogic #truth
If you have to convince your partner of their worth, how can you expect them to honor yours? #deeztherapistlogic
