Went to my first DGR meeting. The ladies of DGR are just a ball of joy. I also got a brand new mommy. @EssieChristina we look just alike!
Reason #1 why I know I couldn't bring my family to Harding: Their comments and message to me on Facebook.
Trust me, I don't want to be old and alone. But I don't want to be searching for love at every single corner either. #TypicalDrakeQuote

If I can't fly then I'll run, if I can't run then I'll walk, if I can't walk then I'll crawl, but whatever I do, I have to keep moving.
Just spend a dollar and a quarter to push a empty slot on the soda machine and walk across campus empty handed. It's one of those morning.
Everyday I'm meeting someone new. Someone I can now call a friend. Just amazing how positive the atmosphere is here. #ItIsGreatToBeAtHarding
