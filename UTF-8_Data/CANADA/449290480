It's so messed up that either the Spurs or Clippers will lose round one
RT @DrewUnga: Carlos Boozer’s cap hold is $20.64M. http://t.co/egF0lz7SA5

RT @AmirMd_: @Cavsanada DeAndre Jordan is in his first All-NBA team. http://t.co/A8vtcJtDcR
Man... Haynes voted Crawford second for sixth man...
Until this year he's done an awful job at applying a supporting cast. Harden trade.  RT @HPfouts33: @Cavsanada how so?
Hot take: Presti has been a bigger problem than Brooks

"Did you even go to the game" is my favourite response I've received from a recap
Dont lump me in. Love Washington's players even tho the fans are crazy. I pull for Toronto to an extent cause Canada

The only thing Toronto and Washington are playing for is to determine who fires their coach after a first round loss
NO. I NEED THIS THO https://t.co/f57xlS69Fg
This team is so fun that the TT/Mozzy bromance probably isn't in my top 5 favourite things about it
LEBRON HATES KEVIN LOVE SO MUCH THAT HE'S TACKLING HIM ON THE SIDELINE https://t.co/dFwrIHCuxz
That LRT is incredible
Thibs coaching OKC is still the nightmare. Durant wouldn't make it to free agency
If OKC hires Mark Jackson I'll be fine with everybody leaving. Them's the rules.
That'll teach Brooks for injuring Durant, Ibaka and Westbrook
