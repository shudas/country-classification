Here we go! Good luck @EnglandRugby #CarryThemHome
Watching Tron2 on the tv. I absolutely love the Daft Punk sound track. Not a bad movie either.

Bags packed and waiting for pickup for drive to ferry port on Ko Samui. Flying at 17:30 back to Bangkok and hopefully the sun.
Got a little friend. He didn't link the fireworks! http://t.co/VToGR6DcBW
Ko Samui not so good in the pissing rain, so booked flight back to BKK from Surat Thani airport on mainland. 8am start for boat trip.
2nd time we've eaten here. Really good cheap Thai food. Green curry and Phad Thai for 80 Baht (£1.50) each. http://t.co/uPqZ8qasYi
Overcast and raining here on Ko Samui, but very warm. The beer is cold tho, so I'm fine. http://t.co/WrYDFVV9R7
Watched the @SaintsRugby game from my hotel room in Ko Samui! Chromebook, hotel wifi and a dodgy feed was all I needed :-) #COYS
Thai bar snacks! Yum yum! http://t.co/VfKoxWeydd

It's great to get a win, but Samoa were designed to lose and not playing world class rugby. Lots to do @EnglandRugby
Nice move Marlon! Not!
We're winning, but not in a very convincing way. #CmonEngland @EnglandRugby

F1 is corrupt. I think the rot is Bernie Ecclestone. F1 needs to get rid of his tyranny! #askcrofty
Would be a travesty of justice if @JensonButton didn't retain his drive at @McLarenF1 next year. Top driver and a great ambassador of F1!!
Nikki Lauda; love the rat faced racer! Always makes great television.
Interstellar movie at the @giantscreen Brum sounds good!
Come on @LewisHamilton, you can do this!
Got to admit, I've got a bit of a crush on Claire Williams! 😍 @WilliamsRacing
F1 Time. Go @LewisHamilton and @JensonButton
Ha, Carry on Screaming on now ITV Can't believe this was made in the year I was hatched. Great movie. 'Frying tonight'!
Love the @EnglandRugby fans drowning out the Haka! #CarryThemHome #ENGvNZL
Good luck to the @EnglandRugby squad, esp the @SaintsRugby boys. #ENGvNZL #CarryThemHome
Also, new fangled test found burst blood vessels in left eye. Prob caused by high blood pressure or cholesterol. Got to go back next week!
Eye test done, and a £18.50 test fee has turned into a £607.50 bill 😱
Having my eyeballs tested!
Bonus Point please @SaintsRugby #COYS

Beautiful morning on the farm checking the Barn Owl boxes. http://t.co/nzLiqSSHQ7
Cracking movie that! Really enjoyed it 8/10 Wished I'd got a 3D version though, would have been a visual treat.
Before the movie starts, I'd best get myself a banana then stand on my head and drink some of my own pee! #monkeybusiness
Next movie tonight is Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. 'Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!'
Watched 🎬 A Walk Among the Tombstones. Bit slow but a typical Liam Neeson movie. 6/10
