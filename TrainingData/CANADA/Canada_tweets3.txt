Book 3/50 Station Eleven.  A more hopeful book about a flu pandemic than The Stand and I quite enjoyed it.
BATWOMAN AND RENEE AND RUCKA! YAY!  I guess I have to buy DC again... #reneeandkateforever
Finished book 2/50: Feeling Sorry For Celia by Jaclyn Moriarty. Technically for class, but it's just delightful, much better the 2nd read.
41 unread books, 44 weeks left in this year. If I read more than 1/week occasionally, in Dec. I can buy new books and make 50 read in a year
I decided to stop buying books until I finish all my new and unread ones. My pile is currently at... a lot. They must be procreating.

HOLY FUCK I COULD SCORE BETTER IN A SHOOTOUT BETTER THAN THE #BRUINS
remember how great the #Bruins were against Edmonton...and a rip roaring start for the Bruins
to the stupid carnival that is the shootout...#Bruins with their luck...you can kiss that extra point goodbye.
Flames Kris Russell and Dennis Wideman have 23 blocked shots between them.#Bruins team total is less than that..a stat that says volumes.
#Bruins have fucking ZERO "puck luck"...OMG
If Eriksson buried half his chances tonight #Bruins aren't trailing and on cruise control. ..but this is the past tense Loui Eriksson.
bout time!!!#Bruins
I could see if the #Bruins power play could bail them out from time to time but the simply can't score anymore.Too much perimeter play.
these are the games that will ultimately cost the #Bruins a playoff spot.Just no urgency from the core of players.Nobody wants it.Sad state.
a game the Senators are glad the #Bruins are playing like shit...Speed killing the slug Bruins.
WOW. ...another #Bruins penalty...
