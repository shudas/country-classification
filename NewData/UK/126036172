Always good for a laugh is our Lord P. https://t.co/TICYRNrGLR
The @snp retreat on FFA is really quite  incredible. Somebody in Bute House must have said "I think they are going to offer it to us help"
Well said Emily  https://t.co/pSM3vvXvRj
What about a mention for our broken promise on tax free personal allowance promised 10000 delivered 10600. @bbc5live @tonylivesey regards
It would appear the @Conservatives manifesto is to secure a base vote. Have they given up on a majority clearly yes.
Always a good read. I also purchased the Tablet app subscription. Try folks  @DavidPBMaddox http://t.co/oXoguQBQAS
I am still glad we went into government in 2010. Only option at the time. @LibDems  https://t.co/BzeDMUVT1y
Good to hear. It's the way it should be. No debate can lead to poor decisions. https://t.co/jx3eIkq95T
Nice to see the @Conservatives Right to Buy crumbling around them Two grillings today @adamboultonSKY  and Emily from Newsnight. @Mancman10
If this had been the Tory manifesto in 2010 I suspect Danny David and Co would have been saying our manifesto or no deal. @LibDems
The Tory election strategy throw as many things out there as possible and hope nobody notices they are really rubbish. Amazed
Looks like the Tories policy on minimum wage and no tax is smoke and mirrors. Thirty hours !!!!!!!!! @LibDems
Traditional Tory voters won't be happy with that situation.
I said a couple weeks ago that the Tories and SNP have more to gain by scratching each others backs. Tories appear to have ditched Union.
"@STVNews: Liberal Democrats: David Cameron is fuelling support for SNP
http://t.co/LeFgsuvoiB http://t.co/IlOytLaPFR" This is so true.
http://t.co/bbxOgGZnlR Interesting fact check on Labour. IFS comments on all parties regarding  Tax Avoidance numbers very true.
In .2010 the SNP received circa 20% of the vote but only got 6 MP's The FPTP may work against them. @LibDems
ICM poll definitely an outlier @Mancman10
Polls everybody back to work nothing of interest today.
"@HuffPostUKEnt: Is this the new face of 'Top Gear'? http://t.co/3qc1cOG1iF http://t.co/TX9V0O9Rb1" @LGlifeisgd
The Tories once again announcing a policy which is for the few. It has been their problem for years.
Fantastic press release from @Cajardine showing cross party support to defeat Alex " I have a new book to sell" Salmond. #SNPout
Not watching #Marr however it's sounds like Osborne picked the wrong interviewer this morning. Marr seems to have gone for him big time.
Time for the @LibDems figures people to calculate the true cost of this Inheritance Tax announcement.
I have been taken by surprise the headless chicken campaign the @Conservatives have conducted  so far.
its only a few days but  its well worth extending a huge thanks to everybody in the Party working so hard. Keep it up @SalBrinton
The Tories details on NHS should be welcomed. However to issue them after a sticky period in their campaign is poor timing Makes you wonder
Listening to @CarolineLucas who speaks well however if she was Energy Secretary she would not have the same freedom to take that position.
Why does Cameron say they will freeze REGULATED rail fares ? Just interested in the use of the word
http://t.co/lSKB9UJukb words fail me. A story ?
The comfort zone of opposition is not something I desire. Shouting from the  sidelines and nobody listening is a terrible prospect.
"@iainjwatson: SNP have accused Labour of scareMongering on fiscal autonomy" The SNP claiming this sounds familiar.
Don't rate Liz Truss
If Fallon made comments about Milliband were to change the narrative from Non Doms the media fell into line. British people the loser.
