In the 2014 origin series NSW clearly spotted Thurston in D... and came out on top that never ever happened to Joey. @MattyShowsFox #NRL
I reckon overall Thurston has had better teams at the Cowboys than Andrew Johns ever had at the Knights.
Every fan knows that contracts or letters of intent really mean nothing in the #NRL until round 13 is dusted. #7moreweeksofthis
This is the only reality. ... if DCE stays at Narrabeen... the 2015 season will well and truly kick start for Manly.
Is Chuck Norris the American equivalent of Australia's Richie Benaud? #Icon
Try lowering income taxes &amp; halving tax on any overtime &amp; see what that does for productivity, job creation &amp; ultimately tax revenue!
This @woolworths ANZAC advertisement gives us all a choking new perspective on the word "Fresh".
2 for 22 minutes silence.
If the panel on @MattyShowsFox is divided on Frizell being marched, in hindsight putting him on report must be the appropriate action. #NRL
Glen Stewart... he never ever played on the left edge for Manly. #nrlrabbitohscowboys
Are Tiger Woods injuries in anyway related to those of Robert Allenby?  #TheMasters
My squatting every day plan was going awesome... but I've just crashed looking for a PB &amp; like Ricky, been consumed by the invisible fire.
Manly should be honest and upfront about our enquiries with Brett Firman. #GoManly @ozsportstalk #CinderellaStory #Abracadabra #NRL
If social media is divided on whether Frizell should have been marched, in hindsight putting him on report = the appropriate action. #NRL
Ok the 18th man concussion emergency should come in mid year as of next round. Stop dithering... #LetsGo @Todd_Greenberg #Abracadabra #NRL
#NRL fans are so reactionary. "RIP - The Send Off" ... lol dramatic much? 
Putting Frizell on report was appropriate &amp; fine by me.
Because the Bulldogs are so admired &amp; everyone's 2nd fave team perhaps we could go all the way &amp; give Tyson Frizzell all 3 #NRL Dally M Pts?
I reckon if there's only 18 minutes to go then Frizzell gets sent off... but with 31 mins the refs blinked.  #NRL
I'm surprised with the reaction from Bulldogs fans... generally I'd expect an excuse like "accidental... he was falling" #NRL
Karma... at 18 zip it's starting to really bitch up the Bulldogs.  Oh... and that's halftime.  Des has some work to do.
I've seen this guy before... I think it's Benji Marshall... where has he been since 2012? #NRL #CinderellaStory #RaiseAGlass Hope he's back!
Man who throw beautiful cut out ball to unmarked winger is man who gets paid the big bucks. "Confusion circa 2015". #NRL
Great call touchline dude... hear how disappointed Gus and Frederico are... n9 kudos to the touchie for his correct call. #SaveOurRefs #NRL
Try this... good vision... great ball... great line by Dugan... top shelf execution. #NRL
Big ol' fat rain in Canberra.  #NRL
So many marginal referee interpretations in an #NRL match... if the players play better then marginal 50/50 calls are less of a factor.
Richie Benaud is having dinner with a Mischievous Badger tonight. #Abracadabra #2For22 #GodSpeed
David Gallop = Captain Serious
The Ben Hunt interview:
"Look Locky, I can't kick at all... so I just run at that Maloney &amp; score free meat pies"  #NRL @TripleM_NRL
Well that kick into the crowd = Ben Hunt's best kick all night. Maloney runs thru Hunt &amp; Hunt returned the favour in GP. #Abracadabra #NRL
Big fan of Ben Hunt but his general kicking game hasn't shown the improvement many would have hoped. #NRL
The Roosters thrive on giving away penalties in front of the stix to shut down momentum... no dramas... always take the 2. #NRL
Anyway... at least it's 18all...  so is anyone still critical of those 3 penalty goals now? #NRL
Jake Friend knocks it out... no try.
This is wonderful stuff from JWH and Sammy Thaiday. A real life old school front row battle. #NRL
Jack Bird reminds me of Laurie Daley.  #NRL
Huge fan of Ben Hunt. .. the right stuff. #NRL
I can't believe we are looking at this. Thank fuck it's a try... get nervous when they look at the same vision 3 times. #NRL
Low News this morning... That's 2/22.
The great man Richie is with hard &amp; fast Tony Greig now.
#RetireTheBone #Respect #RaiseAGlass #2For22
The great man is in trouble... 
#SaveRichie
Blake Austin is playing better with more confidence each week &amp; Rick Stuart sorts that shit out by buying Aidan Sezer. #Abracadabra #NRL
BREAKING: The #NRL offer @NRL_Bulldogs fans rewards for dobbing in 2 unruly fans... Seasons 1 &amp; 2 of Sons of Anarchy. #Abracadabra #2for1
BREAKING: The #NRL offer @NRL_Bulldogs fans rewards for dobbing in unruly fans... One free Water Bottle Voucher. #Abracadabra
Here we go... @9NewsSyd Wow!! There's someone "concerned" about something. Super, now there's too many boats on the Harbour. #Abracadabra
Well done @NZWarriors : BANG they planned immediately, keeping fans in the loop replacing Tomkins &amp; buying RTS. @SeaEagles write that down!
I've never been backwards in saying I'm a fan of the @NRL game first and my club 2nd. Without Refs there is no game, they have my respect.
