The post @iSocialFanz mentioned - Why the Speaking Industry Needs a WakeUp Call! http://t.co/9quY4RIFvJ #cloudtalk
I happen to like it when @iSocialFanz rants.  Lends credibility to the almost always positive things he says, no? :) #cloudtalk
Love what @danielnewmanUV is saying right now.  THING ONE with employees- give them tools/resources they need for performance. #cloudtalk
Still live on air here: https://t.co/ebq0jzhhww #cloudtalk
A6) Ease of use. Whatever needs to be done, an eye should be on keeping things as user friendly as possible within strategy. #cloudtalk
I think both the IT side and the employee side need to keep their minds open. Let go of stereotypes and preconceived notions. #cloudtalk
A5) Explain the "how" &amp; the "why" to the folks who need the tools. Context is huge. Welcome them into your challenges &amp; thoughts. #cloudtalk
Truth. RT @Rsikarenk So many companies are light years behind this conversation. #cloudtalk
A4) Employees and IT can't function independent of one another. Better to get each other's support and stop pushing back. #cloudtalk
A4) Employees are hands on. Their buy in / input is critical to avoid failure. Without it, it's basically a pissing contest.  #cloudtalk
This ---&gt; RT @1Patriciann A3 Show them how their jobs will become more efficient. #cloudtalk
A3) Big picture, situational awareness. Asking for discipline from employees - help them understand why/how. And then enable it. #cloudtalk
All the LOLs. :) RT @Rsikarenk Paging Dr. Fanzo....Dr. Fanzo. #cloudtalk
