Don't think it's possible for me to feel any shitter
I'm just another fucked up teenager really
I only need one hand to count my true friends
I may have done some bad shit but it'd be nice to be appreciated for once y'know
new beauty products make me happy
if anyone annoys me at work they're deffo getting bar blade to their jaw

set of wankers
'unfriended' describes social media today so well it's un-believable
100% always feeling like I'm getting pushed to one side by my friends lol
de-activated my Facebook 

let's see how long this lasts
so done
it's weird how you can click with someone so much
majority of my friends are going on holidays this year and the only trip I'm taking is the one from my bed to my fridge
imagine being able to get out of your skin and escape for the day 

that'd be so good
sleepover on Friday and road trip on Saturday with baè☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️

Victoria Secrets underwear are the best thing http://t.co/AVi15R5M3r

I'm that person that gives people advice but never takes it themselves
you can't please everyone in life 

it's simply impossible
last Saturday I pee'd my pants infront of my boss

ama do exactly the same thing this Saturday too:))))))
sometimes I cry more when I'm crying because I think how lame I am that I'm crying
I feel like a zombie from Shaun of the dead

free alcohol doesn't do me any justice
The only emotions I feel at the moment are anger and frustrated
it's 1:41am and I'm ordering a bar blade for work

oh
and that's why I have trust issues with boys
and by that I mean, you said you could have me not being able to walk yet again I could run out of the house before your mum caught us
actions speak louder than words 

and your actions are totally different to your words
there's always that one person that's far more drunk than everyone else 🙋💁 http://t.co/SXB9MABXrn
just feel like shit really
having bipolar causes so much damage in relationships😞✋
having a massive forehead and having to wear my hair up is a disaster 😩😩
I feel shit so I'm going to spend all my mums money on clothes tonight before work

yay
imagine having @shaycarl as your dad, you'd never have a dull day in your whole entire life
you're a dick, I hate you, how's about I throw a rock at your perfect white teeth
I am so unbelievably tired due to @loisbannister wakin me up because she doesn't like education.
this time last year I was at my lowest point and in the darkest place, it's a shame that nothing's changed
most people are scared to be happy because they don't know what the future holds
and if you're still breathing you're the lucky one, cos most of us are breathing through corrupted lungs
d'ya know what else fucks my shit up? the fact that nothing can be normal or straight forward or simple, it has to be weird and shit
also what else frustrates me is that people use me for money, cigs n shit, but your own fuckin crap, jeez
d'ya know what else fucks my shit up? the fact that people say I can 'trust' them when all they do is stab you in the back
y'know what really fucks my shit up, is that one guy ruined my trust with any future potential relationships, cunt
y'know when you get 'blocked' from seeing ya supposed 'pals' tweets

get fucked ya mong
I've taken a massive like to lip liners
I'd take a bullet for some of my friends

I don't have work or college and I'm awake at this time

there is only a handful of people that I care about considering half of my 'friends' couldn't give two flying fucks
it will always play with my mind as to why people feel the need to put other people down to make themselves feel better😳😳😳😳
definitely fed up of feeling not good enough day after day, it's getting beyond a joke✋
