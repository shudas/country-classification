Last day at @NetSpot/@Blackboard today. Suppose I should think about a farewell speech at some stage. Been one hell of a ride.
Excellent bike safety presentation today by @bicyclesa &amp; MAC. Is the presentation available online? No, because copyright... #headdesk
Please let anyone but Watson finish this out...
Made the walk to @thelionhotelsa for the second innibgs (at @TheLionHotelSa in North Adelaide, South Australia) https://t.co/8g7yphYlHb
Hey @TheLionHotelSA - much room there this evening for casual World Cup watchers or should we head to the British instead?
So apparently responding to a wrong number with ‘I think you need some practice using your telephone-machine’ means I’m a sh*tstirrer...
Good friends, good food, good wine, good cricket.
Sodden in the Gong.
Love reviewing @techxplorer's writing. He write's short, succinct sentences. I write long, flowy ones. We meet in the middle. #writercrush

Tweet got favorited by @managerspeak yesterday, which means my work here is pretty much done. I am now at one with my duality.
