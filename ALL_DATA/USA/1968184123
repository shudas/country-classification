you're hardly worth a penny compared to my dime 💁🏽
I honestly don't give a fuck about how you feel about me 💁🏽
lol but it's just a thought 💁🏽
hmm here's something new how about you just get to know someone before you think you know everything?
people think they know you based off of what someone else told them about you..
she is everything I need that I never knew I wanted
literally everything ☺️
she is...
it ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
she wasn't once upon a time
she don't love you, she's just lonely
😍😍😍😍😍 http://t.co/Lv8LsdZOWU
you can promise her forever but you'll never have her heart
CRAMPS ON TWELVE 😭
thought she peed on me she so wetttt boiiiiiiii
I said I've been there too a few times
she says what you've heard it's true but I can't stop thinking about you and I
I heard that you been out and about with some other girl
and your nigga can't do nothing for ya 💁🏽
maybe you should get an education before trying to insult somebody 😘💁🏽
seriously the most childish insults include the words fat, ugly, and bitch. like they are so over used lol
these next couple of months are going to be interesting
they aren't worth it
I'm done giving any fucks about people
it's like everyday I learn who my true friends are 👏🏽
sick to my stomach
I'm so done with people lol 😂
but as soon as they peep something remotely close to being about them they get offended like they care? #cornt
why do people say they don't give af about what people think of them?
wait the reallllll question of the night isssssssssssssssss
skept ast fuckt
backbone... wherettttttt? 🙈😂
and you seriously wonder why she left your ass
you're the definition of pathetic as stated the other night
boi you always acting like you're trying to pop off but you'll never do a damn thing 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
👸🏽💁🏽
lolololol why do people constantly assume!
the things I hear 😂😂😂
Jillian and I broke up today so I treated myself with a two hour workout and these babies 💁😁😍 http://t.co/gZgpx3HmFs
I've been awake since before tennnn this is weird lol
outlets. nails. gym. then tanning 💁
and say, "you ain't got the juice like that you ain't got the juice like that" that's cold, ice cold girl you ain't have to do him like that
someone that's so proud to be with me she walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
I need a girl who gon' love me I need a girl who gon' trust me someone to fuck me someone to make me feel lucky
and it's annoying AF
worst thing I do in my sleep is lose my earrings 🙈
or peepin someone popping off lol
lol he stays on Twitter trying to make shit pop off 🙈😂
if you aren't goal oriented I don't need you in my life
if you would think for yourself and not listen to people all the time you'd be happy right now and not all worked up over someone unworthy
pathetic
and never will be. you're going no where in your life and as an adult you cannot function on your own.
how do you continue to lie to yourself like you don't even know what it feels like to be happy 😂🙈
lol I cannot stand people like you
can we just talk about all the advantages of not being with someone who has nothing going for them 😍😘👌
im ready for a change
when you thøt I could be replaced 😂👌
TF you talking to
she don't want this life
I be like girl I'll always get back with you know who 😘💁
you know who
spent fella money tonight and drank hella bottles
don't fuck with none of them, they way too irrational
bbygirl you need the finer things
niggaa want my spot but will never deserve it
you forgave me for everything
you see why im cornfused
a lot of things you claimed you wanted me to change are the things you love about me
im sure she's an angel but the timing ain't right
so one last time
said she don't speak French but she'll tongue me down
it's been such a long week
and I know exactly why
and starting to be unable to fall asleep....
