Sometimes what you are most afraid of doing is the very thing that will set you free.
Just wanna hot tub rn but @SierraVeraCruz I guess is too lazy to go... But like, what is more relaxing then hot water and jets?😒
Trying to write an essay that is due tomorrow is a struggle. Tomorrow morning might be a little more motivating.🙈👌🏼 #procrastination
No there ain't no rest for the wicked until we close our eyes for good😜✌🏼

If you live off a mans compliments you will die from his criticism.
I love when my dogs are in a cuddly mood💓

We love the things that hate us
the worst is when you take the little things for granted and then it's done and you can't remember those moments that are so important now.
We can head to the crib in a lil bit, show ya how I live in a lil bit😘😛

don't worry about the damage done, just let those words roll of your tongue, even if you're lying
Hitting the punching bag is a lot more fun when you really hate someone at the moment👊😡

I don't want to have to question things anymore. I want consistency.
