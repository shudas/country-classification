I can't believe I'm missing Big Brother/Survivor tonight!! :(
Every time @malsy7363, @kaitkraz and I are scheduled together. http://t.co/UFw59czVWm
Here is my #BBCAN3 audition. http://t.co/DuI4XmnJyR
My fashion choices in one shirt. #PokemonMaster http://t.co/UNfxmthEff
Again, hate people who cry. #heartless #BBCAN3
I hate when people cry. #BBCAN3
Tonight is the night for all those people who don't watch the feeds to be disappointed. #GetReady
Sarah is killing it! #Dying #BBTV
Every time @kaitkraz reminds me Zayn isn't in #OneDirection. http://t.co/HOJMMIw2yE
This is the best I can do @BigBrotherCA!  #BBCANModelSearch http://t.co/gOVbp9Y8G3
Farrah Abraham is actually life goals.
Must be frustrating for BB Production to keep thinking that their ideas are golden when in fact they're trash. #VetoFail #BetterLuckNextTime
Mud puppy. @pugmatters http://t.co/Calgkcwqik
This avi though... #fierce
I actually miss The Hills. http://t.co/d8wcr1EnBk
Bored AF right now and I'm trying to can but literally can't.
Can I start a #kickstarter to get summer tires?
JP is definitely the Derrick in this house. Calm, cool, and collected.
"All Hands on deck" is my current anthem. Thanks, @Tinashe.
Wish I could post something super cute for #NationalSiblingDay. #OnlyChild
To make a #facebook or I'm I better off without? hmm...
Bobby "I don't want to win HOH or use POV" like why are you here? #GoHome
I haven't used my #Veto vote and I'm still not sure which to pick haha #BBCAN3
Me &gt; Johnny #BBCAN3
‚¨ÖÔ∏è eyebrows on fleek.
Can we just take a moment to imagine if Risha re-enters the house... #BBCAN3
I'm sorry how did Graig get more applause than Sindy... like what? #BBCAN3
Brittnee slays her DRs. #BBCAN3
What happened to the straight hair, @arisacox?? #BBCAN3
I'm finding myself attracted to Joe. @Survivor_Tweet
Dan how about you do us all a favor and self evict.
Who's excited to see Graig evicted?! #BBCAN3
Weird that this was side by side. @stinestinks http://t.co/pzrPg3vSc9
Let the Naeha gods shine light on your HOH win tonight, Sarah! #BBCAN3
I always want a new tattoo until I look at my bank account.
I would like for @BigBrotherCA to use my Selfie after Graig is evicted. #KThanksBye
Chilling with @DerrickL from #BB16 #Winning #BBCANModelSearch http://t.co/0ksquOys52
Graigs gameplay: #BBCAN3 http://t.co/bxy3COzZhM
Followers! Lovers! Ex-lovers! I changed my Twitter Handle!
ZaynLovesMikhail is an available Twitter Handle and I couldn't be more happy.
Literally every time I see Graig. #BBCAN3 http://t.co/eHFXrX2eWS
I feel bad for people with bad eyebrows.
Did anyone find out who won the POV?
YAASSSSSSSSSSSS
I would love for willow to "throw" the comp knowing Sarah or B would do whats right for the girls.
Honestly I need Sarah or even Brittnee to win HOH.
Imagine if Risha won to come back in... #BBCAN3
Sarah seriously needs to win this HOH.
Fuck off Graig.
Omg Sarah is breaking my heart.
Poor Sarah will have no one soon.
Kevin is on my #ByeFelicia list.
Naeha we were all devastated don't worry girl.
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS. @BigBrotherCA
Every time @kkarasiewicz tells me she hates Big brother. http://t.co/HdQsBeNJ4H
I was actually born on #EasterSunday so it's safe to say that I'm Jesus.
I need more tattoos!!!! http://t.co/WjTm1OEYIs
I locked in my prediction for tonights eviction! #BBCAN3
When people can't get on my level. http://t.co/AqSHqSnxMp
If I won this BB contest to enter the house, I'll probably die. #Fact
The man who knows everything learns nothing.
Graig telling Sarah she's gold... please.
The ONLY positive with Kevin winning is he isn't part of the chop shop.
NOOOO
I'm not sure who I dislike more Graig or Godfrey.
I need Sarah or Naeha to get this HOH.
Graig those glasses aren't cool. Sorry not sorry #BBCAN3
Relax Johnny, he's just not that into you and it doesn't help that he's straight. @BigBrotherCA
"Peek-a-boo, No thank you" YAS Naeha.
Naeha slays my life.
I knew it was a prank! #BigBrotherCanada
That just completely me! @Survivor_Tweet
Seriously @MamaC_14 is a beast. #SurvivorWorldsApart
Oh god @ 'Merica
My dad doesn't know how old I turned today, #Classic. #SoundsAboutRight.
If Graig isn't one of the two noms this coming week I'm going to have an issue. #BBCAN3
If anyone in the "Chop Shop" wins HOH tomorrow I'll end my life. #notreally #justdisappointed
Godfrey, no one cares about your psych major, you're a floater so go float. #BBCAN3
Is there a camera actually broken? or is BB just stirring the pot for April fools?
Thanks, @kkarasiewicz for the cupcakes! they're delicious. #paleo
24 years old now and I still slay. #birthday http://t.co/cCrlBzyvXk
I really want that veto necklace haha #BBCAN3
All of my followers are invited to come to my birthday tomorrow. Bring gifts.
I'm currently in a food coma.
I just realized the #BBCAN3 intro is in alphabetical order. #noob
I just levelled up to increase my #BBCAN3 voting power @BigBrotherCA https://t.co/3Vks1nwszB
I need a girl that isn't Ashleigh to win HOH this Thursday . #BBCAN3
I love Sarah and Naeha. So happy they're allying. #BBCAN3
I would love for @NaehaSBBCAN3 to win HOH next. #BBCAN3
And the feeds are down.
HG's are looking through Kevin's unemployed bluff.
I love Sarah, I need to befriend her. #BBCAN3
This snow can stop any time now. #ByeFelicia
Selfie game is strong. #eyebrowsonfleek http://t.co/Kq7S5Q5cw8
I'm not here for the floaters, #savesindy
I should make a Facebook account just so everyone can wish me happy birthday on Tuesday.
Im so happy for my followers keeping me up to date with all things big brother. #loveyouall
While I'm here I should go enter the #BBCAN3 house. http://t.co/Km8SOrcRqC
I feel hungover and I didn't even drink
I would love for Brittnee to win POV even though I know she isn't the main target. #BBCAN3
Op, Bobby wants to send a guy home! Perfect.
Watching @PilarNemerBBCAN attempt to cut potatoes on the live feeds is the highlight of my day. #BBCAN3
Noooooooooooooo #BBCAN3
This is why I need #Risha to stay in this house, Cougar has claws honey. #BBCAN3
Queen Sarah and Brittnee onto kevin! @BigBrotherCA
I need Rodney to go. #bro
Queen @MamaC_14 strikes again! #Survivor
Goodnight World. üåå
Based off of first impressions who would you rather stay in the house #TeamPilar or #TeamRisha? #asksarahbbcan2
How shitty would you feel knowing that not only were you the first to go home but the public decided that. #BBCAN3
Vote now for the #BBCanTwistosTwist @BigBrotherCA https://t.co/6xERjX2lhi #BBCAN3
Ugh, I'm voting for Pilar but It kills me.
Ugh WHO DO I VOTE FOR!!!
Time for Pilar to stand next to Risha :(
Nobody wants to be the first one to go home so get to work Risha!! #BBCAN3
It's uncanny how much Sarah resembles Nicole from #BB16
Was it Cindi with an I and not a Y, I didn't quite catch that. #BBCAN3
S/Cindy needs to take a serious 5. #BBCAN3
Sindy, nobody cares that its with an S. yours truly.
This whole time I'm imagining myself in there finding people who I would align myself with. #BBCAN3
Willow is adorable. #BBCAN3
Ginga ninja, lmao... love it. #BBCAN3
I actually love #BBSarah, @BigBrotherCA
#NationalPuppyDay http://t.co/rqXbeDlJVY

Since its @BigBrotherCA season it only seems fitting to design my homepage in all its glory, thanks @stinestinks for that comment haha! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Happy that i'm off Monday night to watch @BigBrotherCA!
You know you've made it in life when someone random adds you to their twitter list titled "Winner at twitter".
