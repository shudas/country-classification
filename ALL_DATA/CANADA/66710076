😭😭😭😭 explains how I feel today about school
Feeling extremely sick and school fucking sucks.
Is it too soon to be thinking about Christmas already?? Because all I really want it to go somewhere nice and hot so that I can relax.
The real question is if I'm actually going to make it to winter break alive or not.
Even my parents avoid me and don't wanna be around me when I'm upset. 😪
Tired of always having to put in the effort.
I'm pretty excited about my scrubs! http://t.co/gxnyqI1nel
Should I or should I not go get myself some ice-cream is the real question.
Apparently September isn't even bad yet and I'm already doing homework all day everyday soooo yea death by school??
Summer flew by and it doesn't even feel like I should be going back to school already. 😫
Camping life. http://t.co/Z6kNmKJbgp
The Google maps car drove by my house while I was outside so basically I'm going to be famous.
Kim Kardashian looks like Michael Jackson in this photo and it's kind of trippin' me out. http://t.co/hDzPggF8LR
Well I just spend a thousand bucks on textbooks so I'm just going to go hide and cry in a corner somewhere. http://t.co/DL4b5vFXrx
Giving up on people cuz all they do is ignore you in the end. Animals are cooler anyways.
Bae for a week. Woohoo http://t.co/k11aYRWE8w
Kidney infections suck ass. Thankful for pain killers tho.

Extreme makeover my life plz.
Quite heart broken that I can't find my roller coaster tycoon game.
My friends cuter than yours. #latenight @SamanthaMclean4 🌾 http://t.co/QQsSYcaVx9
Nothing like getting up at 4am for work.
I wish I wasn't staying here for school. Complete change would be nice.
My dreams are perfect sometimes so it sucks to have to wake up from it to reality.
My summer will be complete if I get to go to the ocean at least once.
I could really go for eating donuts while watching Netflix right about now.
For a guy you look more like a really ugly lesbian.
Kinda wouldn't mind if 80's/90's swim bottoms came back in style.
Someone please go cliff diving with me next week.
I work at 6 am tomorrow, how the hell am I supposed to wake up that early.
Someone come get ice cream with meeeeeeeeee. I'll buy.
Treating myself with a delicious alcoholic beverage because I hella deserve it

Not sad what so ever over high school being over. Beyond happy.
Well i guess i should probably start studying.
Someone have a pizza, movie date with me please. Pretty please.
A couple more days. I can do this. #selfmotivation
This last month has been hell. I 110% deserve to treat myself to a shopping spree after it's all over and I will.
Realization if we all had fur or scales we wouldn't have to worry about having nice skin. Why do we not have fur or scales?????
Baby @SamanthaMclean4 's ice cap virginity being taken. http://t.co/mH9NYks11l
Stressed is an understatement.
Sleep deprived for dayzzzzz.
Just saw someone face timing while driving. Idk if she knew how stupid she looked.
I've had to do more homework this month than I have this whole year.
In desperate need of coffee this morning.
Motivating myself to do all my homework by promising myself a shopping spree once I catch up.
Knowing school is almost over is the only thing keeping me going.
Sometime life hits you with tampons. @KSnippa #bff #loveyou http://t.co/zJaCY3AvgB
