Trying out a new summer babysitter! Might be able to sit down and enjoy some nice weather for a few minutes. http://t.co/QvQbnQi5fJ
Chocolate for breakfast became a terrible idea this year. Timeouts for everybody!!
I can't stand to look at those millionaire jerseys the #canucks wear. Not even in a sportscentre highlight pack. #poormarketing
Former NHLer Stephen Peat charged in Brookswood arson via @theProvince http://t.co/2GoD4IdopH
Hearing that @EdmontonRoyals game is headed to double overtime. Makes me wish I was 21 again. #winning #playoffs
Realized tonight at practice how young my peewee team is when they started debating the validity of the tooth fairy.
Pretty impressed to see the Double hug on #nakedandafriad   I think they might be spooning for warmth at night.
Giving up 7 goals to hurricanes is never a game you can hang your hat on. #oilers #questionableeffort
My old junior coach got fired this week. They were crazy to keep him for 20+ yrs, then they proved it by firing him during the playoffs.
Overheard tonite: 4yr old to 1 yr old: "don't drink the bath water, dad says it has bum juice and you'll catch hoofy-itis" 1yr old: "yuck"
Crazy story about the athlete mentality. Playing with blood clots. #machine http://t.co/SfDdQiMuS2
Boy did Hansen flub that original point shot. #canucks #lucky
Pretty humid looking in Bali. #thebachelorette #frizzfreecurls
These #teambc helmets at #CanadaGames look terrible. #menshockey
The sting of losing doesn't decrease as I get older. #losingsucks
Gm 3 goes today after a barn burner last night against vanderhoof. Short staffed, come watch the storm gut out a series win @11am#playoffs
One of those shifts you wanna forget. #canucks
Playoffs baby!!  Best time of year when a 35-5 record means nothing and only your last game matters. #wintomoveon #roadtoprovincials
Kinda wish the #oilers would stop kidding around getting points. #mcdavid #rebuild3.0
Turns out the chemo made me sun sensitive. Woulda been nice to know b4 falling asleep in the pool. #gonnahurtinthemorning
Nice work @AirCanada. Cancelled out of yyd 2 days in a row, now delayed at yvr 2 hours. Does any other business operate as poorly as #ACA?
Lotsa stunned cheeseheads at c-link field in that last crowd pan. #seahawks
Need an argument settled. Does anybody think NW BC exploration is coming back to anything more than 20% of a couple years back? #apocalyptic
It sure isn't easy to escape winter from yyd. #fog #soupy #delayedflight
On our way in the morning. Weather looks ok for the next couple days. http://t.co/tiVfjEOuBB
Digging out. http://t.co/mWNze52rUO
Decent way to kick off 2015 http://t.co/diDk7kwEj8
This #FSU team is coming unglued. The #OregonDucks are really puttin the boots to them. #noprisoners #hammerdown #CFBPlayoff
Eichel wears a cage in NCAA and mcdavid a visor in OHL. Why the opposite in wjhc? #samedraftyear #differentbirthyear
Mcdavid scores. All of canada can relax now. #notaslump
If you ever want to run into somebody you haven't seen in a while, the liquor store on Xmas eve is the place to do it.
Feats of strength at 10, airing of grievances at 11. Happy festivus everybody! #movethecouchaside
John Scott has been on the ice for two minutes. Does he think he's Ovie? #knowyourrole #oilers
Don't want to miss your breakaway pass otherwise it's a long skate to retrieve it. #winterfun http://t.co/eVTaut816y
Nice couple of solid errors to finish the #oilers game. Gotta be sure in the last minute boys!  Play the body, defensive side...#dayonestuff
100oz to Klondike gold, 20% royalty and 350+oz gold for plant. The 1000oz goal on #goldrush doesn't leave a lot in the vault for the crew
New coach, new look, same crappy result. Bad teams find a way to lose. My peewees will light me up. #oilers #ainteasybeinganoilerfan
Johnny Football puts up a humbling performance in his first nfl start. #ouch
Watching Home Alone  and Home Alone 2 on another channel. Puts me in the holiday spirit. #wetbandits
Survived another one and came out on top. Shots 72-5, need I say more? #60shotsguaranteedwin #peeweestorm
Gameday baby!  Time to close out 2014 in winning fashion as the peewee storm take on the seamen, (that's right), from Prince Rupert.
The omega tree stand is not the problem solver it claims to be!  #notasadvertised #junk http://t.co/62FnU3aR4I
2nd consec. Tourney where we win our way in on Sunday and play back to back. #peeweestorm #winning #champs http://t.co/QHaWCy5BnV
Exactly why I wanted to leave the Xmas lights up all year. #tangledmess #spreadthejoy http://t.co/hHCCtCFTnP
Tough times in oil country when you can get tix for less than parking. http://t.co/yyFbdBeDZy
Found a nice Xmas tree but forgot straps. Good thing we had a belt and a dog leash to hold it. #smallproblems http://t.co/2WGiOKhwmX
This month has the potential for big news with pending #BCLNG investment decision and groundbreak on Nicaragua canal. #majorinfrastructure
Teams don't make the playoffs in the first quarter of the season but they sure can lose a shot at them in the first 20. #nhl #oilersrebuild
It seems a little extreme that junior clubs are starting to contact 12 yr olds on my peewee team.
Snooki tying the knot this weekend. I wonder how Vinny feels? I bet that will be a colorful wedding. #jerseyshore
Dog has a rotten tooth. Vet wants 700 to yank it. $40 for whiskey &amp; 12$ for locking pliers at CDN tire. #wifegoestoworkbutiamgettingshitdone
Champs!  Smithers peewee storm win the Winfield tourney beating Langley 4-2. #winning #solideffort #smha http://t.co/iHyhZ7MX0Q
Good teams seem to find a way to win. The #oilers seem to find a way to lose. Great job of blowing a 3rd period lead. #whatnow?
Bullshit move by the @TheAHL to change rules on knocking net off. That's just situational awareness by david leggio. #2on0 #goodmove
Figure it out #extrafoods! Instead of a truckload of coloured pop and pizza, let's get some cheese, yogurt and milk http://t.co/3GfjVMp9xQ
Team picture night. Coach shaves with the dullest razor on earth. Rookie move. #razorburn #neckrash
Holy cow! #Royals
I don't see how that gryba hit tonight gets a game misconduct. #softcall
What a block on that return. #CowboysvsRedskins
I guess my talk last practice on chiseling didn't sink in. 24 goals for in the first weekend game and only one second assist. #scoringrace
Favorable tax scheme or not, LNG in BC has huge hurdles to clear in lack of infrastructure &amp;First Nation opposition. I'm not banking on it.
Oilers win!  #rejoice
First road trip of the season. Off to the 'hoof to tangle with the bears. Coach is pumped. #peeweestorm
How bout those #Royals
Days like today one needs to remind yourself: it could be worse. 6 years ago today the Dow dropped 700+ points. #correctionterritory
Joseph Randle makes 500k playing for the #Cowboys yet he was busted for shoplifting $123 bucks of cologne and ginch?  Embarrassing.
Every time the camera goes to Eakins, he looks like he's at a loss for words. Team defence only works when 5 guys are on the same page.
Thankful for family, great friends and living in a country that values free speech and universal healthcare. Happy thanksgiving.
That was a lively bout! Nuge and @DanyHammer2   Opening night festivities. Love it.
Let's see if a yr of experience allows for the #oilers to maybe win these games when leading after 2. #timewilltell
Pretty sweet spin move at the blue line by @DanyHammer2   #smoothmoves
Good job @Sportsnet getting your hosts name wrong. #workingoutthebugs http://t.co/aqoaXCruYA
Snipe. Bar down baby!!  Just like the peewee storm.
I feel like I'm watching the Spengler with romanuk making the call. #bringbackhughson
Glad to see mark Donnelly making fun of himself after his viral video last week.
#oilernation #gooil
Not totally sold on this new #HNIC  Hard for me to take seriously with strombo as the lead hand. Always be a much music VJ to me.#90's
I feel like I could have ordered lobster in from Halifax for less money than the free range, organic turkey grown locally. #stickershock
Tossing your oilers hoodie on the ice in a decent game is a real loser move.  At least wait until nov when the oilers are out of it.
I'd love to see Engelland get ahold of Burrows.  Witness to a destruction, just like the old days.  #jrbroommates #eags
As an @EdmontonOilers fan, it's really tough to choose a team to cheer for in this cgy/van game. #gohammer
Booker Mays playing dead on the fake punt is one of the funniest plays I've seen in a while.  http://t.co/AGra2DprhL
Season opener for the peewee storm. Not sure who's more jacked, the 12 yr olds or the coach. #gameday
Funny way to quit work.   http://t.co/ltgLFS3GGg via @Breakcom
Off to the rink in shorts and sandals, love the start of hockey season. #peeweestormtryouts #firsttothebarn #kidagain
#lbpaving, dial before you dig fellas. You probably installed that gas line 30 years ago. Lucky that Main Street didn't end up a fireball
Just unknowingly did the ice bucket challenge in the shower. No gas, no heat or hot h2o. Thanks LB Paving. Certified operators?
The mining co probably hired the driller b/c they had a JV with the Band. Turns out its worthless http://t.co/MoxxxPxUkN #Whatsnext?
Mike Tyson goes off on Nathan Downer LIVE on CP24 Toronto. Iron mike at his best. Unbeatable.  http://t.co/AjpXErAyaX
I don't condone domestic violence but ,hold on here, does anybody believe #RayRice is the first nfl player to hit his partner? #probablynot
Who's sucker punch is going cost more? Bertuzzi or Ray Rice. Talk about career altering decisions.
Nobody markets their product better than the #NFL   Absolute masters. #printinmoney
Wishing Bree's would throw to jimmy graham more. #ineedthepoints #doesntdropit
No matter the sport, it doesn't get any better than overtime. #NFLSunday
Let's hope Steven Jackson stays healthy in my fantasy pool. #NFLSunday #FantasyFootball
Sunday is such a great day!  NFL football followed by royals game day.
Pretty funny take on the teachers strike by cdn comedian.  https://t.co/3iXITBv2Bo
For the first time today, doc said 'achieved remission' rather than 'strive for'. It's a good day. There will be a party. #everyonesinvited
Hey #extrafoods, no cheddar?  My 3 year olds pretend store has better stock than you. Get it together! #yousuck #offtosafeway
I feel bad for teachers that want to/have to work and can't right now. The stress of not having income is not easy to deal with.
First pheasant chase with two dogs. Summer ends but fall begins. #sportingdogs #spaniels http://t.co/eeGby2JCFi
(2/2) ...crib sheets.  2) just cuz the dog is 12 does not mean she is old enough to babysit while you shower #bachelordad #figuringitout
(1/2) things my wife didn't tell me before leaving for fire camp 1)when the kid's hair smells so bad after a nap, you gag...time for new
not looking good for a govt deal with  the teachers the way the BCFS is blowing through money this summer.#wildfires #emptycoffers #broke
I'd be willing to bet tinder is going crazy this weekend in the fall fair campground. #swiperightcowboy #loveintheair
Great perogie lunch at the #bvexhibition thanks to the legion.
Great concert by @AaronPritchett at the BVEX2014!  Made me feel, well, kinda cool again (for a little bit) #thosearemyjams #theranch2005
Aaron Pritchett is smithers. Great show! #bvexhibition http://t.co/sv4lxMQC8A
Had a drill job lined up in the cariboo, pending permit. Guess I can kiss that one goodbye. #thanksimperial #"tobedetermined"
