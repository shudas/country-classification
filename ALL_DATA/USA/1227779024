Always complaining about never spending family time, I cancel all my plans and I end up alone in my room. I guess that's cool too
I didn't make any plans so i could hang out with my parents and watch a movie, and here we are with the same argument as before
I don't know why but I'm just in the shittiest mood today 😔
The only thing getting me through this week is that next week is spring break☀️😎
My parents are honestly borderline crazy sometimes
It's been literally 2 weeks in a row that I went to bed at 9:30 on a Friday night I think something's wrong with me😂
I feel so bad, it was pretty shitty of me. 😔
It's kinda getting sad when someone In your group of friends is stealing everyone's shit

Have you ever just woke up in the middle of night and realized how happy you are? I wouldn't trade it for anything
Take responsibility for your own actions. You blaming someone else makes you look even more weak than you already are
Last night was too perfect
So if there's a problem he run up like nigga what's goodie
I roll up every 15 minutes like a bus stop
