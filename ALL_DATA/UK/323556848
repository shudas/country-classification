Decided on an all nighter
Carl Froch is solid 👊👊👊
Don't know why I even had Bayern on my bet, they play like this every week, was so confident with Barca too
Neuer, Guardiola, Alonso etc, you're all arrogant shit cunts 😃👎
I'm having a stressed out five minutes where I'm worrying about ten things at once, help
