Out of boredom just spent 30 minutes cutting all the split ends out of my hair 😂
Running off 30 min of sleep and I have to get through the whole day. Awesome 😞

So I had my door open and was in my bra and underwear and management just came in to my apartment. Thanks for knocking lol that was awkward
I always eat when I'm bored. I need to learn how to control myself 😭😂😂

Decided I'm going to start chopping off every man bun and burning every fedora in the world.
Then he's like "we would be a good couple. We would go together like coffee and cream."  What is going on lol
Waiting for the light rail and a guy keeps asking me on a date to the movies. And he's like "why don't you see us together sheera?" Wut

When a guy swears he knows you, and you say no, but then he shows you your number in his phone 😳 I'm so confused
The reason I'm broke is because food is literally all I ever think about and I swipe my card too much between class 😩
This sucks, but it does make me proud I don't get my stuff handed to me
So much to pay for, this is so stressful with school. 😞
When you find out you're most likely taking a party bus to edc and your friends are letting you stay with them for free &gt;&gt;&gt;
I'm going to find a way to help people when I'm older and I can't wait.
