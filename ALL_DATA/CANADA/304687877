Oh the things I'd do to just skip ahead to when I get married and start a family ☺️
You aren't maturing. You're avoiding and you're hiding.
Wouldn't maturing be living up to your actions and apologizing or making any step to better a situation? Cause you aren't. You're a coward.
I can't stress enough to anyone to trust your gut feeling. It's literally always right.
And who would have thought that someone I considered my best friend is actually the biggest whore I've ever met. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
Can't believe the last year and a half of my life has been a lie
It's literally never ending
I just woke up with billies finger in my nose 😅
Don't you hate how wrong you can be about someone??!!¿¿!?
I just woke up after 10 minutes of sleep thinking the last 6 hours of my life was a joke or dream and I'm even more disappointed now 😅
2 days into "winter" and I find that one patch of ice and fall on my ass walking to my car 😪 ugh
There's literally no better feeling than understanding something in school 😅
