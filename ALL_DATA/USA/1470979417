Straight line passes thru paint rarely make it.  Spacing on last break was awful.  We're playing hard, but must play BETTER! #WPS
Have u never seen a floater???  #GoHogs #We'lltakeit
Playing fast is fine...  Turning it over in a hurry going to get us run out of building!
Survive and advance!  #WPS
Great patience by Hogs...  Portis gets layup!  Late game composure a must! Now make FT's!!!
Last 4 Wofford pts come on 2nd chance shots...  Box out!!!!!!
Wofford getting most 50-50 balls.  Qualls only threat from 3, bigs can't play in post...  Pack line taking away our drives n curl cuts.
14 seeds are HOT!!!
Oh the madness!!!  #Sunbelt #Brackbuster
The ball is tipped, and there u are, ur running for ur life, ur a shooting star...  #MarchMadness #itshere #NoWorkGettingDoneToday
