I just had the worst service at @AdditionElle. Maybe the girls were just having a bad day... #yyc
That moment when you sneeze and pee a little.  #imold #andclearlysingle
If someone wants to bring me dinner or even take me for dinner it would be greatly appreciated. #grumpy #yyc
That moment when your manager is late and comments that you are early.
When your employer forgets a $150 of your pay. #HappyEaster
This is my life. #yyc https://t.co/tCnrqMlEpx

Grumpy, grumpy, grumpy.
Early Saturday mornings.
I need to be youthfully felt because God, I never felt young.

Sassy black woman telling off teens for the win.
Everything you want is on the other side of fear.
Not having a phone for one day is killing me. Maybe I should get out more....
When I don't even have the motivation to walk across the street.
Hi twitter, I left you and now I am back.
That second date excitement.
My bus just came early and I missed it. Thanks again Calgary transit and your "realtime" for never being accurate. #yyc #calgarytransit
And then I changed my hair....

I am always dissapointed with calgary transit on Sundays. #yyc #calgarytransit
I'm so glad it's Monday, I'm sick, and off to work for nine hours. Perfection.
My job makes me want to scream some days!
When it's 12:30am and all you can think about it is how many of your ex boyfriends are married now. #theansweristoomany #yyc #foreversingle
You're emotionally unavailable? Perfect, let me try and date you.
Why am I trying to sleep with someone that was awful last time?? Typical Adria right there....
Monday is my Friday. #yyc #finally
I wouldn't be surprised if I slept a good twelve hours tonight. This girl is exhausted.
The bus has two minutes to show up...sure hope it does so that I'm not late for work.
