My head is pounding, probably from all this damn thinking I've been doing
Had enough of the male species

Rough morning
Missed painting my own nails http://t.co/UfZoCcuD9W
Feel to throw my extensions away, don't even wear them anymore
Oh man such a big ass scratch on my phone :(
I'm at that stage in my life where I don't have enough close friends and the ones that are either work full time or don't live round here
Wanna go out in the sun but no one to go out with 😕😕
Feel to sack uni and just get a full time job
Okay my eye is in too much pain right now ffs
My mind is fucked, I think I'm going insane
The perks of being natural, you surprise people with length and volume http://t.co/pWJDVax9e3
Eg: a girl that love beards *gets into relations with 500 guys with beards*
Hate it when people decide they have a type then go for every person that ticks that box
Actually kinda excited for summer ball, I love getting dressed up and feeling pretty ☺️
Mood: drake
I'm so glad I'm not an easy bruiser I was definitely have a black eye today

How Mwando head butted me last night and has a bigger lump on her head than me 😂😂😂😂

If I had money right now I'd be the happiest girl ever
It actually breaks me seeing. How long my hair is when it's straight and how short it is when it's curly
I can't get tired two hours before work ffs 😩
I feel sick seeing those tweets 😷
Don't know how I've got it in my head that I want to highlight the ends of my hair blonde when I'm trying to grow it
Want to dye my hair lighter 💭
I think I've just watch the most disgusting thing on the Internet, my eyes are physically burning after that

Who left a voicemail on my phone saying 'hi Rhiannon where the fuck are you we're outside Pryzm' 😂😂
Aldi's knock off chocolate bunny is delicious
Positive conversations and happy feels
I love people with a good energy about them, these are the people i should surround myself with more
It's so weird it's like a sleep in 4 hour shifts
I fell asleep from 7 to 11. Now all I can think of is Beyoncé 💃💁😂
why can't a relationship just start as a simple friendship why do boys have to be extra asking me to meet in the first sentence
This guy must be on drugs the way he's talking to me
Can it be pay day already 😩
I'd love to enjoy this nice weather we're having but work says no
I miss having cute cuddle nights so much 😢 partying doesn't even compare
What would be really nice right now- a film a cuddle and good company 😩
My whole body is throbbing, I don't think I've ever been so exhausted

B r u h, why am I still awake
I need a job where I can sit down, these two jobs have walked the life out of me
Ugh I have some serious thinking to do 😩
Feeling antisocial 😶
Why do I think it's okay to get the camera man to take pictures of me whilst I'm wasted
