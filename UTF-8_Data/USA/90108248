It's almost like watching these things, in their individual increments, is some sort of preview for when they stream on Netflix.
Netflix has ruined me. Waiting week to week for my shows is brutal. #Arrow #Flash
Why do I have to wear a label for thinking equality should be common sense and common place? #Equality
...as tribute to all of the people they fuck on a daily basis. Lookin at you #Comcast #CONcast #corrupt #tyrants
I feel like it's time to call for the public suicide of the executives of every major cable company #tribute #atonement #sacrifice .....
The best part if waking up is moot when you are obligated to spend the next 9.5 hours milling away at the same mundane task #workflowNO
I feel deeply disappointed that the phrase "Quit playin' with your Wii!" wasn't more popular. #wii #quitplayinwithyerwii
Anybody else stare off dreamily into space, humming I Need a Hero by Bonnie Tyler when thinking about their cable provider. #DownWithComcast

I really do love how far the #Whedonverse goes.
I just spelled virulently correctly the first time #SelfHighFive
I want to be better at the twitter. But, at the same time, I'm proud of myself for sucking at it so virulently! #innerturmoil

When someone is trying to smell like cocoa butter, but winds up smelling like popcorn butter. #hmmmm.
I do love it when the #Flyers are incorporated in an episode. #Bones #SeeleyBooth
Finally getting @nickjfrost involvement in #DoctorWho. A merry fucking Xmas indeed.
A lot of #heavymetal news, I think, is more depressing than the mainstream news a lot of the time.

My @comcast internet is down and I'm still paying for it...there is a bad taste in my mouth.
I wonder what we're going to call nerds and geeks when everybody realizes the cool kids have taken them as their own.
140 characters leaves plenty of leeway for stupidity, but it's also so much easier to ignore.
Whenever I've been gone too long I always end up asking myself why I left in the first place. Twitter is way better.
I had a @$!#ing rattlesnake bratwurst at @BarbedWireReef in Boulder...#YES!!! @Nick_Offerman try it.
I haven't tweeted once while abroad! Well I suppose I've just changed that! #Dublin #Slange #howboutapint
