#LetsGoMets
I don't get being sick. So you're gonna make me toss and turn all night but once sunrise hits I can sleep like a baby...Bitch I'm busy today
Good God, you get sick for 5 days and barely leave the house and then when you come out everything has all bloomed and is green and shit!
I still can't believe @Yelawolf is giving us 18 songs on this album. 6 Days. #SLUMERICANLoveStory
I might hit the 10k club soon
"@DaddyDenDen: On Tumblr they said Wale look like a "where's my hug" ass nigga. http://t.co/JKhXMQAOTb" STOP! "Where's my hug" ass nigga 😭😭😭
But if it reigns too much, it could Floyd. I have Manny thoughts to unPAC, MAN. Weather u get it or not, u May need to think out of the Box.
Pacquiao may weather the storm, but then again May weather always feels so nice because we withstood the manny reigns of April.
"@Sam_J_Schneider: @Jeffd_Up @AaronHernandez cause he's gonna be there a little longer..." Sem... Pls, sem.
"@Sam_J_Schneider: “@AaronHernandez: One more day before I'm released from my cage” well...this is awkward..." Y, sem? Y u doo dis? 😢
"@SportsCenter: ICYMI: Aaron Hernandez watches as guilty verdict is read in courtroom. http://t.co/JiS3bWB6Nv" Damn, this was actually tough
So many parallels can be drawn to tonight's game and Batman that it must be destiny and it's scaring me.
This is the weirdest most awesomely nerve-racking game of @Mets ball I've ever seen.
THERE IS CHAOS IN GOTHAM AND THE UMP IS THE JOKER!!!!
WHO THE FUCK IS THIS UMP GUY, EH?
Terry Collins is gone
Shit happens when your pitcher decides to aim for hands not once, but twice.
THE DARK KNIGHT!!!!!!!
He protects Gotham. He delivers retribution.
Sometimes retribution is drilling Utley in the back.
MATT. HARVEY. IS. FILTHY!!!!
THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS TO GOTHAM!!!!

This match-up 😂😂😂😂😂😂 http://t.co/pkaQNQcUxS
Why do I live so far from Chipotle?! Wings Over's way more expensive, but factor in the time it takes to walk to Chipotle...Can't do it. ⌚=💲
What You Know used to be on constant repeat from like 06 til 09.
"@Mets: Paul Blart takes BP! @KevinJames works on his bunting at @CitiField. @PaulBlartMovie http://t.co/REJkk0cNwd" This how games are lost
One of Jeezy's song on make them bitches get low
I get that ass raised up like Dr. Dre 64
Wayne ruled the 00's, but I don't think he had an album better than T.I. - King. Way too many bangers and hits. Idk, it's close imo.
It's retarded but I'm mad it's making me laugh.
I think being sore from being sick is the worst part about being sick. There's nothing you can do, it's just there. And it's exhausting. 😷😥😴
Derek Carr is getting himself some weapons now. If by the grace of God we don't fuck up and draft Kevin White. That, plus Crabtree &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
The Quidditch World Cup is the lamest snap story I've ever seen.
"@OUAB: JUST ANNOUNCED! Big Spring Concert 4.25.15 on the South Oval #OUABSC http://t.co/13K7Dk2ivv" 🎆🎉🎊😕🎊🎉🎆
The rest of the MLB may not, but @Mets always have a reason to get excited...JACOB DEGROM!

Friendly Faux. Go listen. I know you haven't. Mad underground.
"@WhatTheFFacts: All the recurring jokes in Arrested Development have been charted by NPR http://t.co/GcB5hTOYrf"@the1vapist get this to Ben
"@megpaulsen: who came up with this new booty ass way to quote tweets."
I guess people don't take me seriously. I'm not worried though. I'm used to being an underdog. Still kinda annoying though. I put my work in
"@ViteezyfromVA: Birdman must've sucked dat dick good for Tune to drop that suit"😭😭😭😭
He said fam like he knew he was right!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭

The more I rant, the more follows I get
I'm bored, I just want to tweet nonstop about something again
If you think my twitter goes in, you should hear the convos me, my sister, and my mom have. I just keep it real.
I'd rather talk about the r word than watch the Yankees play.
But boys don't grow up being told that some women are rapists so why should I have worried? #Meninism exists because double standards do too
Scariest day of my life. I had no idea what was happening. Should've known something was up when the ladies were laughing as I drank it...
Actually, no. I've been roofied before, so I actually have more ground to say what I say than most feminists, who've never had it happen
But that being said, I gotta make sure I'm not lumped in with the others. Yeah, I'm a man, but that ain't me.
I'm just trying to promote human decency regardless of everything. If I make you uncomfortable, good. You're a decent human being.
I don't even like the word to be honest. It's ugly. I'm just gonna call it the r word from now on.
But I'm slowly accepting the fact that women own the rape conversation. It's yours. Just like black people and nigga. Just giving opinions
Every chick I did anything with made all the moves. I'll drive the car up to you, &amp; if you like it, take the wheel. I'm not forcing anything
"@KardashianReact: This is so important #YesAllWomen http://t.co/fOymnvISUn" Makes sense except the m&amp;m one...
At least the yanks have the decency to lose so that way it's bittersweet. Gotta watch them 😩, but they're losing 😀.
At least one of their ancestors loved a nigga. Lol. Dude was a pimp, like the slave episode of Boondocks lmfao
Funny thing is we have white family members, like back from slave times, that we found &amp; reached out to. They didn't want to be a part of it
Like, when we have our big, &amp; I mean BIG, family reunion, the other half of my dad's family is the Turners. Just a branch of the family tree
Pac hit that shout out to my fam though. Little known fact, one of my great-great-grandmom's husbands (the 1st or the 2nd) was Nat Turner.
First time I heard that interview... Man that hits hard. That's just hip hop right there.
"@SportsNation: How Duke &amp; Wisconsin students feel about class today: http://t.co/yINpRjLeKD" Nah they got plenty of time til the game
2 weeks til Love Story though
So pissed that I gotta watch the Yankees right now just to see some baseball. I WANNA SEE THE METS. NOW.
Rapsody went in!!!!!
Not better than Wale though. But this FUNK &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Giving TPAB my first real listen. I'm fuckin with it way to hard. @Linwood_M @Atom_Doe @Sam_J_Schneider @_KayAyeEm @JiggyRa0
Hell fuckin naaaaawww! This. Dick. Ain't. Freeeeeee!
"@Sam_J_Schneider: Opening day should be a national holiday. #GoMets ❤️❤️❤️⚾️⚾️⚾️" I fully agree
"@Fever_ful: I ENJOY BASEBALL" I CAN BE DEMONSTRATIVE
Happy Opening Day everybody! LET'S PLAY BALL!!! #LETSGOMETS! #LETSGOMETS! #LETSGOMETS! #LETSGOMETS! M-E-T-S! #METSMETSMETS! ⚾🍎🇲🍎⚾🇪⚾🍎🇹🍎⚾🇸⚾🍎
Update: eating caesar salad in bed while listening to Wale and browsing 9gag. What a wonderful life.
Keep em all on the need to know
My heart still races when I unlock the door to get in the house though. Especially when I fumble with the keys. That's when they get you lol
