If we get this ring, is it pretty guaranteed that James Blair tries to take credit, right?
Aka yanking it outside LeBron's house. And I'd say it to him but I'm blocked so.. http://t.co/wX5kmUxcCT
But I thought... 90%.....but...but... https://t.co/Pb2EFArHuU
This star wars movie is gonna be too nice
L8er sleeve jerseys https://t.co/C5aQBbvNi9
ESPN has the NBA top ten plays and like half were gsw. Dangling from those üçí
Sitting at skyline alone w Miley blasting on the speakers. Happy Thursday, folks
I hope the Thunder, Jazz or Suns get the first pick. I hope the Lakers and Knicks fall out of the top 3
Wow. Cavs have a Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday first round? Do they even care about me trying to party? @nba?
Let's go get that ring.
We're gonna have Playoff Delly. I bet it goes very smoothly.
Delly is a brick house
First game on Sunday? That's gonna be a rough monday
God tweet. https://t.co/gij1uqB9OG
Maybe Bernie can be a history teacher somewhere.
Moral of the story, please ride off into the sunlight and let us all move on, Bernie
My grandma died ten years ago. Not sure I could weep for her today. Homeboy is weeping about a president who died 150 years ago.
You cry on your birthday over Abe Lincoln. 1865.
Wut http://t.co/m6rT3NHKD9
God I wish we could just stop worrying about Bernie. They want him to have Elway's pull in Berea. Model the new uniforms. Coach QBs. Move on
Kid sounds grounded. https://t.co/Gks3uuyxJo
The fuck that even mean? Go get another new logo? Like it's that simple and easy? http://t.co/6vDlMacwuh
Underwear was my favorite back to school thing to buy..... Since everyone used to pull them over my head https://t.co/5S7U9M6fo3
It's 14 and 15, Rex
Yeah that's not actually what happened but sure. https://t.co/c558WiXdrw
How the heck don't they have Hawkins jerseys available?
When keeping it real goes wrong
I'm never in favor of guys going back to college, but not sure I'd take Tyus Jones in the lottery and expect much for a couple years.
The best part about that Bernie tweet is the people in his mentions agreeing w him
Why would Alex Mack do all this jersey stuff if he was leaving I mean THINK about it. #analysis #staywoke
Cuz not going would go great with guys like you. https://t.co/3raPAqGIMn
Going to bed, thinking about my roommate @my_buddy_todd ,then Abe Lincoln
I like the orange and brown and white and orange
And you want Bernie on TV, talkin bout Abe Lincoln
I see it. https://t.co/EvT9hr2NzX
I don't have the capacity in my being to hate those super fans as much as I truly want to.
God I hope the pants are checkered like Tennessee's endzones
And to think, the draft is two weeks away and I didn't have any prospect that I hated. Now I get to hate an entire position.
I don't think I can ever be talked into a running back in the 1st at either of our picks.
Yeah if the Browns wanted to do jerseys right, do it like OSU. Gtfoh http://t.co/1RZJ5IsrBH
Oh it was Fedor. The resident fantasy football expert. Give me a break.
Our running backs had 1300 yards and 12 touchdowns. Stop being "ooh shiny red ball" all the time.
God dammit. No. No first round running back. And top 20?
Lol. The marketing team needs to be watching film http://t.co/YBynspolI9
I think the funniest people out there are the ones that think they're superior because they only care about winning.
THIS HAS BEEN SO FUN. WAIT TILL WE START DRINKING
Where is the white one?
A true art form. https://t.co/JNRvOxi9wC
If Mariota doesn't go 2, he falls. You don't take a back up in the top ten. Maybe you trade to 8/9 in front of STL. I don't see NYJ doin it
Why would the Indians schedule a game tonight during the jersey reveal? Selfish much?
Down arrows on his pants to keep him on the ground. RT @lilOUmikey: Peter King = tenured professor. ART 470 professor for all you Bobcats.
(I'm going to a bar to watch the presentation on my phone so, no room to talk)
Players are talking jerseys. This town man
Wahlberg is everything
Don't turn on IFC unless you've got 3 hours to spare. You've been warned
Plz win the championship. I want to tell my kids about JR Smith @cavs
#Put5InTheRafters
Light them up, indeed JR
So basically every team in the top ten has been linked to Mariota now. Not happening. More OL/DL will go early than is being mocked
Sean, God mode. https://t.co/6PdZm6EgZX
But I was told Bruce Drennan thought he has a bad year. And he has a radio show so he knows. https://t.co/2UlsWJln4I
Urbans extension won't matter when he's the Browns new HC/GM in 2016
Johnny's homecoming. https://t.co/X7AjagkRm9
Hey @browns I just saw Johnny at the bar. http://t.co/Pko4UP5FMx
Yeah... That's not him. RT @ProFootballZone: Johnny Manziel already back at the bar (Photo) http://t.co/KP4qbtH8Ls
Ass fat? Ye I know
Sure is god damn bright out. @my_buddy_todd @DockEllisNoNo @lizzie_rim
I'm just rooting for sheer mayhem
Haha these are the jerseys.... But I hope they're not.... And that they're worse so people freak out that these weren't the real ones.
If maddonna mouth raped me I think I'd consider switching teams. She would have ruined women for me
Today I feel like I literally CAN
Where my never watch game of thrones but hate it people at?
Lefty Mondays by @DockEllisNoNo
Tribe could lose ten in a row. Doesn't matter at this point
Super subtle, Tennessee RT @SNFonNBC: Titans‚Äô brass sees some Tom Brady in Zach Mettenberger http://t.co/zGHhDA2YXt http://t.co/EYtEYczz4L
They should have revealed at the draft w the 12 pick. Then traded down a bunch
Who told me they'd be gray you ask? Mostly my dad
Couple things keeping me from believing the jerseys. 1. I always heard gray and 2. If Whitner saw them no way he says Oregon to those
Hopefully Sands is a nice surprise
Tuesday is gonna be fun
Bought a ps4 and it didn't come with an RF modulator?
Woo man Daredevil is a rated R production. Hot sauce
How fast before people start asking if Johnny watched film in rehab?
Starting tonight. Can't wait. https://t.co/bam2mLzNqb
Yeah Zeller would be nice to have
Acting like you're losing the world series ain't a good look today, folks
