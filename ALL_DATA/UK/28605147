I love the simgm accounts😂😂
Some people's jobs come with occupational hazards. Unlike my job where I AM the occupational hazard.
A customer just asked what perfume I'm wearing because I smelt lovely...pretty sure its the half bottle of Pinot I dropped down myself.
Me and Ebony going halfys on a treadmill is what I call sibling love

Life would improve by at least 15% if you could edit tweets
Because its always repeated tired crap
Not going to lie, almost every time someone talks, texts or whatsapps me I internally sigh because I literally do not care
I tell @ChloeMaver to shut up and stop whining all the time😂 Don't see her greeting about it😂 not yet anyway

Over almost everybody
Over it

"You need to get some." Could you be more vulgar?😷
Maybe I just don't want to. Jesus, not everything is about being so physical in that way
You don't see me judging people who do have sex
There is nothing wrong with not having sex
Don't let anyone tell you that you HAVE to have sex, kids. That's your choice.
I can't deal with all the drunken creeps tbh
I literally have no social life because I hate going going to pubs/clubs

Sit and just watch Netflix or actually play xbox

I shut down the account and I didn't talk to her for like a week after that😂 I so pissed I didn't even play with her during golden time😂😂
Then she added a Caleb account and made him her other half. 8 year old was not impressed by this at all😂
I just remembered that just now and i actually can't stop laughing😂😂 how sad were we😂
We added everyone we knew as well😂 Everyone commented on the page asking who it was and we'd just be like "the water and earth guardians" 😂😂
When we were like 8 me and this girl from the year above me made bebo pages for Irma and Cordelia and made each other our other halves😂
I used to be obsessed with W.I.T.C.H when I was little😂
Black people tweet way funnier tweets than white people do😂 They keep my timeline alive🙌
I feel so old😖
Sore throat and sore head😩 Today is going to be a long day😞
Buffy the vampire slayer should never be rebooted🙅 A new BTVS would be awful.  You don't fuck with perfection.

The only reason I would want a relationship is for cuddles and even then I have teddies and they won't talk through my favourite shows so...
"Get to your bed you drankard" "Ebony, don't entice her." 😂😂😂 #mam
I'm sure I spilled more drink on myself and in @AllannahMitch 's car than I actually drank 😂😂😂
Imagine Claire calling K-Mart Tesco just to piss her off
