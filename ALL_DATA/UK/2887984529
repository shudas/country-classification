Hmmmmmmmm http://t.co/rQzy7KywBb
Still no real debate about schooling in this election other than anti-free-school rhetoric. Missed opportunity for our young to have a voice
.@adamboultonSKY  impressive, forensic and relentless interview with Mr Gove clearly articulating the facts that tax cuts &amp; freeze=worse off
Big black furry face and lips just landed on my face - Rufus has sneaked in....determined to stay!  quality time with my dog #lovemydog
Just looked at my diary for the week. Could do with a holiday.......
On 3 month  training programme for 10K run in July determined to lose  1.5/2 stone for summer
I hate ironing. Need to get someone to do it for me
Hope there is not a punch up between @adamboultonSKY  and @campbellclaret  #classic2010 #argument
Time to iron my shirts for next 2 weeks

Not sure if this is a good image to have in my head as I go to sleep! http://t.co/G8YL1OuEaE
Love my own bed! So nice to be back in it this evening!
Such an ugly election. Wish we could see proper debates. Not impressed by media coverage overall. http://t.co/e91bVfioHV
So nice to be back home.  back to work on Monday
Looking forward to heading back to Somerset tomorrow. Don't think I could live in the capital for a long time.
Think I might head off to B&amp;Q if I don't win the lottery this weekend. Now know what kit to buy for big job thanks to friends at SkyNews
Ears just pricked up - cure for baldness  and drilling  all on one show @StephenDixonTV
Last day in South East- heading back to Somerset tomorrow.
Can I face another televised debate this evening?
Staying in Kingston for a  couple of days before heading back to Bath. Feeling refreshed and had a great day.

Wee Willie lib dem and Jim Murphy  lab didn't do it for me. The two ladies Ruth and Nicola  were compelling -exhibited leadership/conviction
Watching Scottish Television on my laptop in Watford. Love my Tech. Big debate with Scottish leaders tonight http://t.co/2cUg2FdmNH
When will Education figure in this election?  Just a thought.
https://t.co/aGg9yHn1nB
Just had major inspiration to get up  and do something useful as Sky News goes live to a press conference now
This is how I feel this morning http://t.co/qO1vpSdQzd

Balanced editorial on why education should be higher profile in the election campaigns education http://t.co/U2S1Mgee0F
Hope lovely Rufus is having fun time in kennels this week.  Miss him but nice for both of us to have a little holiday http://t.co/N8VzIrSvix
Beautiful day here in Watford.  Spring has finally arrived.  Looking forward to seeing friends in MK tomorrow.

A powerful article http://t.co/XLnu0sMO5q
This made me chuckle http://t.co/J8KpBwI8nr
Education Education Education  -  when will we hear a substantial policy discussion in this pre-election  period?
Back on my travels again - the joys of Hertfordshire this evening  M25 bit of a racetrack between M4 /M1 this evening
My two daughters love @Rickontour
#frenchgate  - What's going on?  Timing odd given Sturgeons excellent debate performance- Seems a bit murky?  Hell , yes to coin a phrase!

Interesting no significant coverage of big education Union  conference debates on TV news this morning........
I think we need to see more policies discussed and less on character and attributes of leaders? Education of agenda! http://t.co/S2CEjxEYeA
Does it really matter what Sturgeon thinks? Aren't all politicians two faced - kinda implicit in person spec. @StephenDixonTV
http://t.co/ipHW4pvYYU
In bed- sooooooooooooooo tired today feeling my age!  Wind howling outside AGAIN!
This could be a good case study for our media/journalism students.  Poor Ed. http://t.co/qgXXZTqsoc
Not sure who to vote for now - knew last week but now not sure
I love top trumps cards  from @SkyNews @StephenDixonTV  Can they put on website to download?
My number 1 was Nicola sturgeon in terms of effective answers. Can't vote for her though in Somerset
Wild animals err losing focus here.....
Education now on agenda at last
Nothing substantive on education issues so far in the debate.
Nigel Farage stop shouting!
I wonder if education will get a mention this evening? So many issues that need to be resolved for our young people.
Presenter of debate (uncanny resemblance) and the set reminds me of the Weakest link Quiz   with Anne Robinson #justobservation
Quite like @NicolaSturgeon - very strong opening statement
Just counted 9 Apple devices, 1 toshiba, 1 Microsoft device and sky wifi struggling to cope - digital house tonight
Nice day in Bristol. Was stopped twice by visitors asking me where primark was.  Feeling self conscious about my clothing today #helpfulface
The most important thing is family!  lovely day doing nice uncomplicated things.
Rufus has just been rummaging in his granny's suitcase- house is bedlam http://t.co/URTHuHDZ7q

I think I might resist doing something amazing for my friends today - yet another email about death!! http://t.co/P0ZrQzSxpW
People don't care about friends in kitchens. Bigger issue- people filling kitchen cupboards  from food banks surely?
Really annoys me when TV journalists remind public that teachers have long holidays and suggest job is easy.40% leaving after 1 year #crisis
Off to @OfficialBRS  now to pick up my mum who is flying down from Scotland to spend time with grandchildren.  A bit of windy!

Day 1 Campaign. Education mentioned ONLY by Labour party with new vocational education bill within 100 days of #GE2015 The other parties?
Just turned on Sky News and Adam Boulton  in a frenzy as countdown to election is now happening.....Exciting
Just organised personal pension planning review appointment - getting old now - productive day so far
Where is labour going to get all these English and Maths teachers to teach people to 18?  Maths situation is dire NOW
Wrote a letter to a friend this evening using a biro. So enjoyed the experience .......
So looking forward to less travel this week- Manchester, Nottingham , London, Bristol, Exeter all in last 10 days
Johnny English on channel 4 - love the first movie
Full house this week with Amelia, Louise, Matt, Rufus  and  Granny!  Just told Rufus to behave for the week- not sure he understood much....
Never been to Exeter before but did quick sight seeing after lunch  before being blown away by strong winds http://t.co/e2dYhe1slQ

Been awake all night worried about sleeping in this morning. Got to be in Exeter for 9 am  which is really 8  and 2 hr drive. Need coffee
Love the song choices  on The Voice this evening.  Happy memories flooding back
The problem with having my kind of job  is - I solve someone else's problems all day, and there's no time for my own. #getsorted
Gutted - just missed celebrity pointless! #onlykidding
'Hell yes' Will be shouted loud tonight if I win the lottery.  Don't care if I look  like a geek from N London #fingerscrossed
Was asked today if I was tough with respect to training my mad  flatcoat retriever, Rufus. I replied 'Hell Yes' - we had a little giggle
Just realised I need to get up an hour earlier at 5 am to go to Exeter tomorrow due to clocks going forward. Bad news for all early risers
Just received this email today- a little disturbing and not on my to do list sadly yet http://t.co/tNXQ5pFcXM
Made up my mind. Know who I am going to vote for in the election.
Nothing wrong with M&amp;S or Waitrose ready meals #justsaying
I think @skygillian  looked totally bemused and baffled by StephenDixonTV  science teachings .... I suspect viewers too. #justsaying
So pleased it's Saturday - 2 weeks of holiday yehüòÑ
