This weeks instalment. How do you find tinder? http://t.co/GHc3HaPQkz
Off to see my new grey Norwegian guy in Crows nest.
I've set up a public page on Facebook if you would like to like... https://t.co/MU1DF9ACb9 thanks!
Also, who was the woman with pink hair next to @KevinSpacey @OlivierAwards ?
Watching @OlivierAwards. why is BrianMay wearing shades? And should I go see @MemphisMusical?
Oh boo @ronanofficial getting married. And I had a dream about him last night!
Hurrah. Flying business class home to oz in August with my miles @EtihadAirways sadly not the swanky new Apartment thing though. #please?
However the one I met on Sunday is keen. I was not that keen on him. Nice enough but not attracted. Shall I see him again?
So last nights date, who I thought was nice, messaged to say we're 'not a match'. I feel crap!!
Oh I did that speaking fast thing about random things. Blah blah blah. But he was quite nice!!
So tonight I have another coffee date. Am on saying marathon.
Omg woman on train with nails literally two inches long. And red.
Just had a Tinder conversation with a guy who spelled horse, hores. You'll probably say I'm being too fussy?
Just visited #thepool for the first time. #like. Especially how it tells you how long the stories are in minutes. Simple yet great.
Loved #britainsgotalent. Less stupid crap acts and more actual talented people. The dog's gonna win though.
A lovely online dating message to end the weekend. From a doctor. http://t.co/mngNeI3AtJ
Omg @davidbauche you need to show this to The Pugs #BritainsGotTalent https://t.co/vexKq8ZlOO
Lunch for the week- veg stir fry and rice.  @SlimmingWorld #slimmingworld http://t.co/mPEdxG5HYB
Somebody in Crows Nest has set challenges on lampposts! http://t.co/TSAPmAPr7I
Lots of hot guys in Aldi. Maybe they should start speed dating? They do like to do the check-outs fast.
#DerrenMiracle carpet
Eastenders was rather sobarama from last night. Liked the musical ending though. #EastEnders
Instagram is a pick-up site now too? http://t.co/CCcg1xQIeQ
Also today, I have been told (twice) my stories are good to read if you cannot sleep! Sleeping can be hard, so I could be onto a winner!
And now I am being 'referred to my landlord' for leaving a bag of rubbish at my door. 'Thrown out over rubbish' would be a good story! God.
Just got the rudest email from my strata over the threatening letter they sent to me! Horrible people.
New shoes for a Friday #shoesofprey https://t.co/eXlhRUc5Kp
Today fred killed and ate a butterfly. Now he is chillaxing. Bad cat! http://t.co/JRuwHrqLgq
This weeks column! http://t.co/hJozfkr75n
Not only do I still have The Cold I now also have sore arm from flu jab #complaining
None of them Scottish colouring books left in Australia. And the girl was asking in front of me at @Dymocksbooks too! On order but all sold!
researching some #anzac stories. I love piecing together interesting, but very sad, stories.
I want a much-publicised 'adult' colouring book and I want one now! Boo. #SoldOut
the film's rubbish but the #fiftyshadesofgrey soundtrack is rather good.
use to love Lost. Until the last few series, when it went stupid.

Barry manilow got married! I can never marry him now. Boo. #lovebarry
Why do some women get the train to work with very wet hair? Most unattractive.
Loving Ordinary Lies on BBC I player.
*sigh* http://t.co/rqprWGpwTw
I had cereals for tea again. Must do better.
week two of my Single In Sydney column for those who were asking (with video)
http://t.co/AcCplmPI6b
Five viewers of my flat today. I asked if they could all go at once like in Sydney, to put on the pressure and make them offer LOADS.
I got colouring pencils. All I need now is an adult colouring book. Sounds rude. Maybe why they sold out everywhere?
Wonder if prince Harry will be at @OperaBarSydney Friday night?
British student to friend on train :"Um I think there might be an election or something in the UK."
Sipping beechams powders on the sofa. Happy Easter!

Listening to @HedwigOnBway it's rather good. Anybody else see IOTA in it years ago? #musicals
Went to see apartment for sale. Ok but needed work. Agent said she sold one last year for 500 therefore this one is 575++ #stupid
Georgio has been sick. That is all. http://t.co/NxNu1bJjgo
I think I must have a virus. Nearly two weeks and still feel crap, though cold has gone. Anybody else?
My gorge glasgow flat is for sale... Share with anybody looking! http://t.co/wOhmn3rAhw
Georgio spewed a fur ball.
This cold/ flu thing shows no signs of budging! Agh.
Talk about making an effort. http://t.co/dvsWvnHgE2
So I liked last nights date. Now begins the waiting for him to call / text/ message / tweet / send message in bottle
My Easter date via @PawshakeAU gorgeous Georgio http://t.co/E7btvS6dza
Off to bed. Wake me up on monday morning.
So do I tell him about #singleinsydney or not?
So date is going well. So far we have discussed travelling. I told him Disney world is my fave place. As it is. He didn't understand.
And this week you can see me talking and everything in a video!!
Second week of #singleinsydney is now live on @dailytelegraph @hornsbyadvocate. No link as am currently out working on Dangar Island. No men
#mailboxes @ Dangar Island Cafe Shop https://t.co/6FfxJDoYTE
I've decided to ask him for more pics.
A tinder guy messaged me. It says he's a sex addict and a widower. He asks if I want to see a movie and have wine. He looks ok but 1 pic.
Just posted a photo @ Hawkesbury River https://t.co/Kww3uKr7Nl

Man just got on train with a shopping trolley crammed full of stuff including a deep fat frier, lots of pictures, a lamp and a bird puppet.
I have a tinder date tonight. Today I am doing a story about rubbish and probably no time to change. Could smell #smell
Goodnight, Fred #catlove http://t.co/D8cxjwgZQL
Hi @Optus my internet has slowed down and i cannot watch my fav tv shows online! Could i have used my (high) data? How do i check? Ta.
Enough with the April Fools. That's the thing about being a Brit in oz. Everything happens twice.
Crimped licked me on the mouth when I picked him up. A lot. He's a French bulldog.
Just went to see my friend at her office. She has an office dog. Called Crumpet.
One of my dates cancelled for the weekend. Luckily it was a cat. And I have another one lined up #cats #dates.
About to do my first vlog for #singleinsydney exciting! Anybody been on any dates this week?
Last night I had horrible dreams about Vampires.
Looks like I have a second client for Easter @PawshakeAU yay! #cats
I really want this @witcheryfashion skirt. Has anybody got it? Is it nice? http://t.co/NxlZcifIfC
I made a @MeanGlrIs reference today. Nobody got it #onwednesdayswewearpink
To those asking yes I did get some date invites after #singleinsydney yes! But also lots more emails too. Stay tuned for more Friday
When you ask to borrow clothes for #singleinsydney and the PR tells you they only loan a size 10. Is this why I am single?  #theshame
