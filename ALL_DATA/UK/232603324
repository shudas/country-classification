Love using lush facemasks
About time I started my detox
Tonight isn't my night
Slow replies are a bore
Always save the day in work
The most gorgeous Porsche has pulled up in work
Someone DM me

Feet are covered In blisters

Finally starting to be happy again
Can't cope with some of the things han comes out with
Can't wait to get my brows done tomorrow
Always regret not having tea because I just pig out
Feet are in bits after that walk
Someone DM me or fav for one
Love this weather
That chicken wrap I made was spot on
Nice drive to Widnes then
Not feeling my driving lesson when i've completely forgot how to drive
Sick of feeling like this
Been revising for 9 hours and still know fuck all
Don't know why I always go for the dickheads
Cba hearing the same bullshit coming out of peoples mouths all the time
Need to start getting back into my fitness routine
Finally decided which Iphone I want
Arsed?:))))))))))
That control of that ball though
What a goal
Come on you red men
That breakfast remix has made my day
So annoying how I've done loads of revision today and it still doesn't seem enough
The day I see fast and furious 7 will be the best day of my life
Hate how I've done loads of revision and it still doesn't seem enough
How on earth has my rabbit managed to split my finger open, the little shit
Finally realised that some people are an absolute waste of space:)
Feel so much better after telling my nan everything
Not being bothered about you is probably the best feeling I've had:))
Had such a good weekend
Chips and curry makes me so happy
Needed that weekend away, feel so much better
Watching the ring 2 with nan wasn't the best idea I've had
Can't be dealing with my nan bring drunk making me watch a horror film with her
Love having heart to hearts with our sue
Watching BGT and my 8 year old cousin says "this is more like it" when the women stripped. Oh my.
BBQ with the fam
Couldn't even find my horse
Mum winning Â£52 the bitch
So nervous
Walks with my cheeky monkey http://t.co/w7XvCWRzBV

Never known someone to be so pathetic and childish in my life prick
Come on Widnes
How fucking immature you twat
Would be nice if I had plans for today

Don't know why I'm bothering to revise now
My heads not in the right place at the moment. Absolutely hate it
Would be nice if someone actually cared :)
So annoying how fucked my phone is
Don't know why I bother ahahha
Don't know why I'm still so bothered
Absolutely love all the fast and furious
Need to start eating my tea at an reasonable time not now
So happy with my new real technique brushes
It's sad when you feel like you have no one and lonely all the time
Cba with people that only speak to me when they want something
I phone at the end of the month wahey
In such a good mood
Proper want to go Chester zoo next week
Really want to go Blackpool pleasure beach
In the mood to go the beach or Blackpool or something
Thought dad turned up to work to pick me up turns out he only came to see my mum then fucked off, feeling the love
Why does no one do anything when the sun is out?!
Being in work in this weather shouldn't be aloud
Sausage butties in work make me very happy
About time I was a happy girl again
Be arsed with work tomorrow
Don't know why I trusted my self in a car with jack,Sam,brad and tom
Today cheered me up so much
Had such a good day at Walton gardens
Fuck you :)
Still need to see fast and furious 7
Has my laptop actually just deleted my revision I've just done?!!!
Just literally need to vent out my anger on someone
Sick of feeling so shit
About time I started eating healthy again
Thought I deserved a bit of respect and I can't even get that
Need to get out the house today
Learnt that being nice gets you no where in life
Pancakes make my day
I still shouldn't be awake right now
