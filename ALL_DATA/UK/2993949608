Wow just reading @GottiVictoria book n must say I have so much more respect for John Sr now! Wish I had the privilege of meeting him #Legend
Did my first 16 hour shift today! Absolutely dying! Aching all over and so shattered. Sleepy time for me I think 💤💤💤💤
Should I be concerned if I have more twitter friends then I do in my personal life? Then again I prefer talking to you guys 😂❤
Ugh, not long finished work and got to watch an hours worth of tv and now have to go to bed as gotta be up in 5 1/2 hours for work again!😔💤
Happy Easter Twitter Friends! Hope you have an amazing blessed day of chocolate &amp; family. Much love to you all 😃😘
Ugh 7am start, should not have gone out last night, feeling rough. Oh how I love work!
I have been awake for 22 hours straight! Think I need to sleep haha
