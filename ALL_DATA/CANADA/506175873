Well this has been a good weekend. Sens make the playoffs and the masters is so far going well! Just have an exam on sunday to ruin it!!
It would be sooo cool to play a round at Augusta! Dream would come true!
Let's go sens!
Fast paced game! Watching some great basketball!

(2/2) he is still one of the best golfers in the world and to have ever played the game. Hope this guy gets his game back on track! #Masters
(1/2) Looks like Tiger Woods will play in the masters. I hope he plays well as it makes golf more interesting! Putting his past behind....

Minor speed bump in the playoff push!
The only band that I listen to is the Arkells. So that's probably gonna be the only night I will be out
Bluesfest lineup is really quite dissappointing... No music that I really listen too...
