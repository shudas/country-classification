When you can feel the depression starting to weigh you down...........it's getting hard to breathe
When I needed you most, you were nowhere to be found.  Good to know I'm only here for your convenience
I love being ignored........

That should be an automatic 2 extra minutes for delay of game.  No reason to start that other than to take a break.  Unsportsmanlike
We didn't really want to go to the playoffs anyway, right?  #Sarcasm

Someone explain to me how that was a penalty to Lowry.  Clean hit in my books.
