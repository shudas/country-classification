Major assignment worth 45% of my grade due Friday at midnight. Sounds like a good time to start the Lord of the rings trilogy.

Yaaaaaasssss boys. #Flames
And that's playoff hockey...
Its days like today that I'm reminded Satan is alive and well. Game of Thrones is on. But every piece of technology in my house goes to Shit
So that makes two lamborghinis I've seen today, and I'm just here like "I've got a nice bike, 27 speeds and everything. "
Didn't start my major assignment due tomorrow until now. But yolo. Cause all nighters are a thing, and my body can take it... Right?
I'd like to take this time to remind everyone that Game of Thrones starts in a week.
I specialize in Networking it's essentially failing at watching Netflix and working.

Is it bad that I've only just listened to the new Kendrick album?
Bye...

Finding a music festival isn't the issue. It's trying to chose how many I can afford while still being able to have a nice life afterwards.
Don't quit your day dream kid. The real world sucks.
... Damn #WalkingDeadFinale
Walking dead. Let's go!! üíÄ
Stop it guys, I'm trying to get my work done. It's hard enough as is. http://t.co/rcxoaQprpl
At least I have my 50 year old coworkers to keep me company. #Lonely #WhatAreFriends
Please. Just please stop. We get that you're all devastated.
I‚Äôm not sure how many problems I have because math is one of them..

pride: chill..

I'm basically a gangster. Just don't tell my mom, cause she'll want me home by 9.
Checks phone. 
Puts phone in pocket. 
Takes a step. 
Feels a small bit of friction. 
Pulls out phone. 
Checks phone.

Dim sum for one....
If pints were on special for 5.50. And I had 60 dollars... http://t.co/hAwMWFY0nY
Stop. You aren't cool. You aren't funny. You're just a douche who'll end up having a mid life crisis.
This day will be the end of me.
If you visit me at work today. I'll give you half off. Boss man is gone. And I'm bored as Shit.
I have two weeks to finish season 3 and 4 of game of thrones.. lets goooo!!
I'm festive. So I added green food colouring to my 2/6.
Need to find a hobby. Open to suggestions.
My hair doesn't fully dry anymore. Just becomes less damp while I wait for my next shower.
"You look like death"
Walking dead .. üò∂
So as of today, 5 people have died in the house next to ours. #BadJuJu #RipEarl
Confidence at an all time high. Ehhhhh!
I want summer so I don't need to remember what day it is.
St. Patricks day pub crawl? Any takers?
Ladies...
People should come back from university so i can have friends again.
The morning after leg day &lt;
Why is it I'm the only person who enjoys just walking around doing nothing with people.
Expand my circle.
Was able to keep my window open all night. Woke up to a breeze and natural light instead of an alarm and darkness. #IsItSummerYet
Music in. Camera slung. Warm weather. Feeling it.
I'm going to find a patio and drink until it gets cold.
I miss the conversations where people wrote sentences, and not just a collection of words. Its become dull. And no one seems to notice.
Comes back to work drunk #WorstBossIn5Words
Perspective is EVERYTHING
or is it just teaching us the power of friendship?
One day his friend just stopped showing up then had depression for the rest of his life. Like I thought this was a kids song...
Puff The Magic Dragon just started blasting in my room. Didnt even know i had that song.
I'm not really sure what I'm doing half the time. But somewhere along the line I just stop caring. #FuckItImMovingToNorway
When you can ease into your moring &gt;

In vino veritas
There was a 60+ year old guy at the gym today. Whenever he finished a set he'd jump up and clap six times. Biggest smile I've seen. #respect
Dont really care what I'm doing, as long as I'm not sitting around inside. #GetOutMore
It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.
Seeing progression is the best motivation.
So bored that I started watching Les Mis in class.
I've never met this @NiceGuyRash, but if I do I'd like to shake his hand and buy him a beer.
If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night, I‚Äôll bet they‚Äôd live a lot differently‚Äù http://t.co/m6abQpPW3D
Live long and prosper. RIP Mr.Nimoy
What dress?.. üò∂
It's always important to put some money into your rainy day fund. Who knows what night happen.
Unless you learn to take chances and trust not only yourself, but others. You'll just end up alone.
Also if you're looking to ruin your mood, and possibly become depressed for large periods of time. Watch the BlackFish Documentary.
People say i eat too much. And im just thinking, well yeah... Thats point.
But you see. Now I have something to prove.
I'm getting paid to sit in a hot tub, and check in on a litter of puppies every 45 minutes or so.

Why am I this giddy? #confused #YetPleasantlySuprised
Pubs not clubs.
If my class is at 10. Why would you wake me up at 6:30.
I've spent most of this class examining my scalp. Heads are weird.
I really just want a blizzard. And fries. I want to dip fries in a blizzard. #Hungry
I've procrastinated way too much this year already.
Think of how fit we would be if we all leap frogged everywhere.
Really don't like working Saturday mornings.
Had a coffee thinking id be doing homework. Now I'm just unmotivated and lying awake in bed.
Snows always nice until about an hour later when it all gets covered in dirt, then turns into slush.
Feel Like Death
#WorldCancerDay Because no one should have to go through losing someone to cancer, or the pain of having it.
I've been living off of halls for too long. #Cold #Sick #SickProbs
Having aches and a cold on top of a workout. #BadCombo
Where did this cold come from. #Buckleys #Lozenges #SoManyDrugs
Fine dinning for family dinners. #Bless
