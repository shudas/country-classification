Thank you for giving me more motivation to prove you wrong. 👍
If that isn't messed up I don't know what is.
My teacher sent my mom an email saying if I tried to finish my class in two weeks all I would have is a series of failed attempts.

My backpack is so heavy that my car keeps telling it to put its seatbelt on
I love @becanswaf
Planned out how I'm going to finish my online class in two weeks. I can do this.
It's terrible how schools provide the same standards for all of their students, because not every kid is the same.
No wonder kids feel like they don't have any options, because this society makes it so if you don't have a good education, you're fucked
If I can barely pass high school how the fuck am I going to accomplish anything else.
Don't think it's right at all to exploit something that somebody told you in confidence.
My parents are going to the Bahamas this week and I'm not going how lousy is that

When I walked into the cafeteria and bet on it was on I just reverted back to when I was 12
I was mad that so many people were talking while theater was performing because from what I was able to hear they were flawless
I honestly feel so bad for my step dad today, he has to see his brother in a casket..
I don't understand how people can be so cruel and never think to themselves just how much what they say hurts somebody else

Do you ever just want to vomit at work because I do
I feel so run down and fatigued and sick
I just want to make my parents proud

I'm glad to be graduating with the class that I am
Very upsetting that people don't know or grieve about the loss of a life at our school today because they are an underclassmen
I don't like to lay in bed for too long without falling asleep
Do you ever feel like you're adopted?
