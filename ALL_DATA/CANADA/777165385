the stars are unreal tonight
such a beautiful morning
I'm so tired of always being tired
sometimes I miss how things used to be
fricken beautiful outside actually
4am and so awake

the only thing school helps me with is my memorization, like I don't actually learn this shit
Ew it's morning
Mumford &amp; Sons is so good

good thing it's a shitty day already
don't care
sleep is becoming a joke
it's weird that we could die any day
today's best : 
sight- sophie 
sound- Adrian's neon
taste- my cone
feeling- jazzy
it's too fucking early
somebody bring me a peanut butter bash from DQ and I will love you til I die
I literally question everything
if I think of outer space for too long I get so pissed off bc like it can't just go on forever right
I get annoyed way easier than I should
God damn I get distracted way too easily, it's becoming a problem :-))
party at my house on the day mrs.kuntze gets back at HCH bc I cannot wait
Spanish is the best thing that happened to me today by far 😂
I'm so good at stressing out lol
