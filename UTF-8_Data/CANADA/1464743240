So I got no studying done today but my room is clean and sort of packed so there's that.
The amount of copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that I have floating around my room right now is ridiculous.
typical Thunder Bay  https://t.co/su5WmlAN58
If I didn't just ace that exam I am going to fall over dead.
Basically, I'm reading the Ontario Human Rights Code for fun, because there's no other way to study for tonight's exam. #futurelawyerthings
So much respect for @jonaweinhofen and how respectfully he handles the backlash against vegan activism. You make us vegans look good! 💚🌱
Future Hearts has been on repeat since its release. All Time Low kicked ass on this record.
"That was 40lbs &amp; 10 dicks ago. A lot has changed since then, I don't bounce back like I used to."
Fallin' on my face again, so I know I'm right on track.
remember that one time in high school some random bitch accused me of throwing her cat against a wall at a party I didn't even go to?
I'm just going to proclaim my love for Jon Snow and then carry on with my day.
This boob bruise has got to go. 🙅🙅
I touched a dead moose today
Where the hell did all my bobby pins go?
Avenged Sevenfold jams at work make me one super happy gal ☺️☺️
I'm so mad at myself for giving in to what I want, never again.
Settle back now &amp; raise a toast to the young ones growing old. All the green lights, long nights, drinkin' 'till I made out with you. 🎶
You'll come back to me maybe, I'll shower you with lies.
really wish I had caller ID....
Basically, wish I could have been in London with @ElishhaKavanagh last night. 😂😂😂
Didn't make it home before the snow last night. My life hurts.
Campus bar just went from Five Finger Death Punch to Avril Lavigne... Lol what?
Preorder bundle came in 😍😍
Would you bail me out if I needed? Help me down, would you catch me when I fall? https://t.co/weYp14Jxpv
Tell me how you really feel, write it on the bathroom wall.
Future Hearts is out now, where's my preorder bundle?
Martha is my true love. 😻😻
Recreant makes me want to throw down &amp; flip some tables or some shit. Major throwback to past Chelsea Grin shows. Love that band.
Waste away. We did it for the fun, we did it for the pain.
"I'm literally fucking you and looking into the eyes of the Hulk at the same time."

Shoutout to my face for being the toughest part of my body. I should have woken up with a nasty black eye this morning.

Nothing better than going out for drinks with the rugby team ❤️🏉
You know your guac game is en pointe when you don't even want to eat it with crackers.
Took Martha on a field trip. She hates me.
I didn't choose the kev life, the kev life chose me.
fb notification for a comment on an old photo involving two people I no longer talk to = small reminder I've moved on to better things.
These property equalization questions are basically my grade 11 accounting class. I love this shit.
"Why don't relationships work? People get to know other on an intimate level and then get bored of each other"
I remember why I stopped coming to this class 💤💤💤💤
What's love? It's true: dark hearts don't break, they bruise. Fuck love, fuck you. I'm dying just to hurt you too.
Today, the band that saved my life, has officially existed for 19 years. Thanks to @GoodCharlotte for getting me through all the bad times.
take me home where the restless go, reckless til the day I rest my bones, there's no use tryin' to save my soul
"I couldn't even email you a pizza because you don't eat pizza."
"tomorrow's only wednesday? oh god, I haven't even gotten over the hump yet?" I feel ya dad, I feel ya.
pet peeve: when men bitch that abortion shouldn't have been legalized. fuck you &amp; your section 2 of the Charter protected rights. don't talk
It's ok to get startled &amp; be afraid of the dark, I'll just wait here to swallow your soul &amp; tear you apart.
Hollywood Undead's new album is out, there's an early stream of All Time Low's new album... So much new music 😍😍😍😍😍
Just confirmed: Martha sees the house ghost too. 🐱👻
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place, I'm not ashamed at all. Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin' 🎧
I actually think I chipped a bone in my foot or something because it shouldn't be this hard to bend my toes.
It's official. The only guys that are ever interested in me are stage 5 clingers or guys in relationships.

Nothing like waking up bawling from the most devastating dream. 😭💔
This headache needs to go
How am I supposed to get up and be productive when Martha has decided to cuddle me and she's snoring away. I don't want to move ❤️🐱
Felt like rockin a 70s hairdo this morning, what of it?
My first meal of the day should not be at 4:30 in the afternoon. 😩
I should have turned and ran like hell last time I got a taste of you
you say you speak from your heart, but your heart's all gone;;
I'm taking a me day. I don't want to talk to anybody.
😠😠😠😠😠😠
my biggest flaw is being too caught up in my ambitions
😥😥😥😥

last fucking nerve
I just got hit on twice in 5 minutes by people I work with. 🙈🙈🙈
City of Evil blows me away every time I listen to it. Love every second of that album from start to finish.
#GoTBetrayals ? How about how George RR Martin kills off every character I begin to like.
There's no looking back from here, no more dwelling on my fears
Love your friends and family, give back to your community, learn something new, and don't take anything in your life for granted #inspired

Does every bus I need to catch have to be delayed today? 😩😩😩
Go figure the only Avenged Sevenfold song @ElishhaKavanagh likes is A Little Piece of Heaven because it "speaks to her" 😂😂😂
have the house to myself but headphones in, so sorry to the roomies when they come home and hear me hardcore jammin from my disaster cave
I'm in one of those moods where I can't find music that is heavy enough
I just found a country-rap song that M Shadows is featured on and I don't know what is going on in my life...
I never thought we'd make it out alive. I never told you but it's all in your goodbyes.
I don't care what they say, I don't need them anyway, I'll just go about my day, but anyway 💁🎶
I'm about ready to lose it.
Anyone able to explain last night to me because what the fuck.
Some people you just gotta let loose. If you can't be honest you can get the fuck out of my life.
Employed 🙌🙌🙌🙌
some people cannot pull of blonde hair...among that list: myself and kim kardashian
Is it even sleep if you wake up twice every hour?
Guess I should get around to actually reading Jane Eyre, since I have an essay due about the novel in 12 days

Guy on the bus just described the combination of French and English as as Frenglish and not Franglais and just no, you're so wrong.
Studying to Danny Elfman scores has been one of the best decisions I've made in a while.
Big fan of the new @hollywoodundead tracks, I'm so ready for their new album.
Had a the best possible dream that was so realistic that I woke up looking for the tattoo I got.. I'm so disappointed right now.
So many cancelled classes this week. 🙌🙌
"I don't know what happens after 18 I can't do this!" -@ElishhaKavanagh  #shes21
So basically, @ElishhaKavanagh  didn't picture living past 18 and is amazed that she's lived to 21 #happybirthdaybitch
Can we repeat last night please because I'm all about good friends, good booze, and good vibes.
