But I mean I'm not in Bo Ryan or anyone on Wisconsin's shoes right now so I don't understand the feelings. Just my opinion.
By allowing excuses you are allowing your team to carry a "what if" for the rest of their lives. When you fall, fall forward.
And complaining that the refs allowed too much contact? Every person who has touched a basketball knows you adjust to how refs call the game
Worst thing Bo Ryan did is convince his players they got cheated. Leaders don't make excuses and don't allow them from those they lead.
Bummed I'm not home to see the look on Doc Amling''s face right now I'm assuming it's a lot like this http://t.co/N2h3ZYElBa
