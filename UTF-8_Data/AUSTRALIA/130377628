Just a reminder there will be a new Star Wars trailer in less than twenty four hours and I am freaking out.
Fine. Damn it. I'll buy an Apple Watch then.
Oh god. Good feature idea. Please no one steal it.
Like if we have a society where it is frowned upon to have your wedding on grand final day that is just so messed up
So apparently Victoria may get a public holiday for the AFL grand final? Like okay I'll take it but also worship of sport not cool guys
Seriously. It's pretty amazing that edits are now public-shaming material.
If writers are seriously being taken to task for things they removed during editing, then I don't even know anymore.
Never, ever showing anyone drafts of my work ever again, and I don't even write anything controversial.

I feel like every news story I see about water on Mars is the same thing. "Guys, we're really close this time - we promise."

The guy who plays Fisk in Daredevil is...not doing a very good job, I think. Weakest character. His sidekick is a better villain.
Work being only a 15 minute drive from my house means more time in the morning to do stuff. STUFF, guys.
It is legitimately amazing to me that some Game of Thrones fans cannot separate the show and books as two projects with different goals.
I know I'm late to the party on this but man, the Red Letter Media tear downs of the Star Wars prequels are *so good*.
Between Daredevil and Winter Soldier I'd like to thank @Marvel for ridding the world of Nolan-style shaky-cam and action close-ups.
Also unrelated by Netflix Daredevil is pretty damn good
I kinda hope he does wake up one day and abandons though cause that would be p funny
Only in so much as you feel you deserve it. Obviously I hope he finishes it too. But I hope much more he has a pleasant life.
Too many people around this time of year say things like, "I hope he finishes the series before he dies", which is like, kind of horrible.
If he, tomorrow, decided to abandon the series, we deserve nothing more than, "huh, that sucks".
Maybe before Game of Thrones begins again we can all remind ourselves that we are not owed anything by anyone, least of all George Martin.
Also when I am Prime Minister I will send people to jail for playing music on loudspeaker on the train.

HBO Now and new Deus Ex - a good morning indeed.
What's the deal with Stitcher? Is it just another podcast app?
I start a new job tomorrow. What dance routine should I perform for my new colleagues to win their respect.
Very surprised HBO Now hasn't opened for sign-ups yet.
Someone talk me out of entering the regional tournament for X-Wing Miniatures.

This whole Rolling Stone thing is just one massive mess.
Ughhhh Aus GGers have started their own news website and podcast why why why
I have a big feature coming out this week yaaaaay
Australia. Where football results are front page news.
Interesting to me that Good Friday is a public holiday in Aus but not in the US, a far more faith-oriented culture.
Quick reminder before Mad Men returns that Pete Campbell is a rapist.
Stop the #fullhouse reboot. With fire and blood.
Man, Legacy of the Void Beta feels like an entirely different game. The pace is ramped up substantially.

If I don't see any new Force Awakens footage soon I may freak out
It's kind of weird that as a society we've decided no one is ever allowed to make a mistake without receiving everlasting punishment.
Oh hey, Never Alone is on PSPlus this month. I know what I'll be doing later.
