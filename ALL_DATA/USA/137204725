She Had The World / Panic At The Disco
She held the world upon a string, but she didn't ever hold me
Spun the stars on her fingernails, but it never made her happy
I'm sure I didn‚Äôt ruin her, just made her more interesting
I just want to touch one.
I need a Pagani Zonda in my life.
"Yeah I have the iPhone 32."
I wonder when Apple will stop numbering the iPhone. Or will there one day be an iPhone 15? That sounds dumb?
Catching up with old friends from a way different phase of your life is the best.
I worked outside for eleven hours today. I drank seven bottles of water. That was fun.
Oh, what it takes out of me to lay by your side
I have grown so much in the last month, it's insane.
Someone just came up to me and told me they love my fox tattoo and that they've seen it on Instagram üòä
And my thirteen year old self can't believe I'm about to see Panic At The Disco.
I can't get over the fact that I'm about to see Glass Animals play.
My dad is planning on buying a gtr. So that's cool. That's worth learning stick for.

The past two months have felt like one of those dreams where you feel like you're falling except I can't wake up and I'm getting used to it.
I don't have a place to live after this month! Cool!

Today was such a challenge, but I loved it. Working with mentally handicapped kids is so rewarding.

If my roommate drunkenly asks me "what happened to White Car Dude" again I might actually punch him but also start crying on impact
Or to the museum. I talk to myself at the museum. It's a problem.
I have no problem being independent and doing things alone but sometimes it would be nice just to have someone to go to dinner with.
How awkward would that be? Is that rude? I would have to walk through the dining room with my pizza to eat it alone in my room?
My roommates have a bunch of family/their kids in town and they're about to have a family dinner together and I really want to order pizza??
Anytime my roommates see me dressed nicely they ask who I'm going out with and I make up an imaginary person every time
I'm not even doing anything today. I'm just wearing this dress because it makes me feel nice. http://t.co/Yei1S3yREO

I'm at work and I can't stop thinking about Washington and how excited I am to go back,
I didn't feel my face getting red. I wasn't nervous and shaky. I didn't stutter or mumble. I am so proud of myself. This is so big for me.

Avery is the best best friend I could ever ask for. She's so great.
Avery: "Why don't you see him anymore?"
Me: "he doesn't like me anymore"
A: "Oh. Is he stupid or something?"
I can't stop thinking about how badly I want a frappuccino. Like I have been thinking about it since six this morning.

It was more of a yell. I can't scream. But if I could, it would have been a scream.
I just screamed because I drove by a man running with my dream doberman and the man got so startled. Sorry.
Take that, greenpeace http://t.co/jK7hUeQfyg
I look like Violet from The Incredibles when my hair is black :)
Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I completely stopped talking to like everyone in my life for no reason at all. I didn't even realize I did it.
Hills. Curves. Weird lanes. Regular lanes adjacent with the freeway running in the opposite direction.
Driving in San Diego is like playing a video game compared to driving in Phoenix.
