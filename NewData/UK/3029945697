Nearing the end of my day walking http://t.co/PeDVzuFY5x
Currently walking...12  miles so far but I'm at least 8 from home!
Run out of contact lenses #speccy4eyesproblems
Wondering if I can be bothered going for a run....
I don't know why but I really don't like that Adam Henson on countryfile...quit banging on about your rare breeds farm you smug twat.
Ugh bellends on here stating how many miles they've ridden this week and what avg speed. Newsflash...no one cares! Apart from you!
Morning all.. For those in the north moaning about how nice it is down south...you'll be happy that its cloudy today!
