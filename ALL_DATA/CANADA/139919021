Stone unable to navigate the tricky nuances of the Gatorade bottle. Clearly injured much worse that first anticipated. #SensVSCanadiens
Nothing better than @healy_glenn smack talk! Lol #priceless
Good thing I drafted all these #Blackhawks #yeesh
Kypreos going blind temporarily is due to his tiny brain not an injury. #sportsnetpanel Let Elliott finish his thought moron
I thought someone said this Hammond fellow was a player?? Looks like a typical #Oilers goaltending performance to me #SensvsHabs

Pillar with a shifty attempt at fooling the Rays defense with a weak chopper directly at third base. Shrewd plan that comes up short #Jays
Omg look at this guys ERA!! I don't care if he hasn't pitched this year...Jepsen is lights out!! #BlueJays
The total number that Nikki Nikitan completed all season #6or7passes
Is that Margot Robbie or Babe the pig? Both make up jobs are amazing!! #Oilers #CraigsOnIt
Why is MacT determining how they are going to play on the ice!? If he goes back behind the bench as coach GM I quit! #Oilers #pathetic
Sweet another development year! Christmas in April baby. #Oilers Just what every Oiler fan wanted to hear! #CraigsOnIt #longliverebuilds
Lol! Omg the pump is broken...quick get the shrink wrap and duct tape! #coldwatercowboys Only these Newfie honkies could make that work
They should re name #coldwatercowboys to Newfie's fucking up fishing.
The @Struds1260 4 min shift is like Will Smith punching out the alien in Independence Day! #rockin
Justin Schultz doing his best Lex Luther impression tonight. Sorry Justin you've been foiled again. The #Oilers win in spite of your tactics

Randell Cobb and the Packers sign a four year deal???!! Boo ya baby! Welcome home Mr. Cobb @NancyStitsen Jordy and Randy sitting in a tree..

Breaking news! The Oilers to change their name to the Generals for remainder of the year. #DecadeOfGreatness #CraigsOnIt
Good news is I have Kopitar in my hockey pool...#oilerpositives #kings #oilers
What is there to be comfy with Craig? 5 defense men who would b hard pressed to crack the top 4 on any other team? You're right no worries..
So Mac-t is comfortable with Fayne, Nikitin, Ferrance, Klefbom, and Schultz...Either my math is off or that is one D man short #Oilers
Did he just say he thinks we're set for another great Oiler decade? #pardon #oilerproblems #CraigsOnIt
