You can only hurt so much, then you stop feeling the pain all the time, but it hits you real hard ocaisinally.
Had and amazing time with my dad, saying good bye to him is by far the hardest thing to do and it never gets easier 😢 http://t.co/aQgoEyTKAu
Seeing @sarahmmtaylor for the first time in almost two weeks is gonna be like reuniting with your lover after 193772 years .
When you put in 110% of your effort to make someone happy for 2 straight years, you forget how to keep yourself happy.
I wish forgetting him was an option, but its not that easy so quit telling me its time to get over him.
I have to wake up in 4 hours so what's the point
Sometimes I wonder if he misses me, even just a little bit.
Heart breaks are hard to deal with ...
Having all 4 wiener dogs on me is just such a good feeling
