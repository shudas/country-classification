Sold my xbox one and lost $300 total. Halo is beyond dead thanks to 343 for putting the nail in the coffin with MCC shipped broken #HaloMCC
A beta, inside a beta, inside a beta, inside a beta #halomcc #halo
Wouldn't be surprised if we didn't hear about another update for MCC in another two weeks... #halomcc @Halo still so many things to fix.
Anyone who wants to chat to @quinndelhoyo Head honcho of halo 5 come and chill in this chat/stream http://t.co/yO89LA5r9t #halo5Gbeta
Wish everyone a happy and healthy new year, 2014 wasn't the greatest.

I really hope H2A netcode gets fixed within the next few weeks, it's frustrating being red bar every game due to low upload #HaloMCC @Halo
Haven't touched MCC in 12 days, come back, update game. Been searching for 30 mins and haven't found a game :/ #343bola #HaloMCC @Halo

Hello üëã Serene http://t.co/opQgUHm2lB
Newest update still hasn't fixed MCC yet..
How could they honestly release this game in this state, it's unacceptable!

New MCC update out, hopefully this actually fixes some things... #343bola #haloMCC #halo
Halo 5 ranking system looks really good. Basically a mirror system to sc2 which works fantastically #halo5 #HaloFest
