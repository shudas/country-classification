love how I always want the people I can't have
there is a girl who is young enough to be playing in the play place, and she has an iPhone 6.......
every single time I sleep at my grandmas I overhear her talking to her dog like its my grandpa and telling him things and it breaks my heart
trying so hard to keep someone who's already gone
I was doing so good for awhile and now I'm just at rock bottom again and it's not fun

using someone to get over someone else isn't a smart idea and I don't recommend it to anyone
last night I watched someone get black out drunk and I now understand why everyone hates going to parties with me so much
I wouldn't wish the bad luck I've been having recently on anyone
