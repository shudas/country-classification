I never knew how much energy I really have. I still had more in me when my friend started complaining about all the hills XD
But the hike felt great! I need to get out more lol
Went hiking today.... Omg I'm tired lol

People will throw rocks at things that shine, and that's what makes life look hard. But I won't worry. Cuz this is MY life.....
You never know what people have up their sleeves. The verdicts come from those with nothing else to do...
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves. And they'll judge like they know everything about me...
Especially @julia_dea12 like honestly lol
That's probably why I'm single, im really complicated and nobody wants to deal with me... I'm thankful my friends put up with me...
I'm honestly a very confusing person... Like I'm loosing my own mind trying to figure me out....
I like being a loner. But I also like being a social butterfly.
But maybe that's just the loner inside me talking... And I'm never quite sure how to feel about that...
But if something good or bad does happen I go straight to my bestie. But they never know until after it happens. Never before. NEVER.
Like if the thought is just in my head n it never happens I don't get my hopes up. If I do say something, it could devastate me...
It just seems like every thing works out better when I don't really tell people what's going on...

Maybe we have to get a little messed up before we can step up...
All the pain and the fear and the crap, maybe going through all of that is really what keeps us moving forward. It's what pushes us...
Trauma messes everybody up, but maybe that's the point...
Tomorrow I start my new position! Finally made it into a management spot!!! I'm excited lol

Nothing I do feels right anymore. I used to be such a happy person but now my life just brings me to the ground in tears... I hate it....
I'm fine most days but I have to stay busy to not think n when I slow down or stop my depression almost kills me.... &lt;\3
I seem like an emotional basket case. But I just get really depressed sometimes...
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace, but there was a blank stare n I just couldn't relate... #NickiMinaj #BedOfLies
I PROMISED you I wouldn't leave! That I CANT live without you... And what do you think is happening now?? We're separating... And it HURTS!
All I want is for someone to tell me that... I'm so sick of all this! 😭😞😖😓
If u want to I can save u. I can take u away from here. So lonely on the inside so busy out there. N all u wanted was somebody who cares....

My stress level is that of 2007 Brittany....
So let your heart be your #Compass when you're lost n u should follow it wherever you may go... Never be alone... #LadyAntebellum
Tell me you'll see me again, even if it's in your #wildestdreams #TaylorSwift
I guess being nervous is a good thing. Stressing means I'm gonna try my best to not fuck up... But I'm still worried I won't be good enough.
