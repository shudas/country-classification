So let me get this straight, the leafs came back with a 3-2 lead from a 2-0 loss and still ended up losing 4-3?
I'm not a #Leafs fan so i can't really talk, but i'm pretty sure you're better off with #Reimer in net..
Haha eat that #Leafs😂 should of left #Reimer in net
As if the #Leafs just took the lead 3-2 in like 3 minutes from a 2-0 loss.. #NotBad
That embarrassing moment when the #Leafs are losing 2-0 against #Nashville 😂
So tired😔
Ugh i thought school was never going to end
