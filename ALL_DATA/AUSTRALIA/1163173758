I'll be next on the spine-o-cylinder, Homer. Back is a little tender after last night's boxing session. Shove away! http://t.co/D9JJg9Ximd
Gaz and the lighter punchline on Sam to finish. #comedy Goodnight. #AFLFootyShow
Feet up. @AFLFootyShow time. Comforting with the moisture content outside.
Cranking their latest album while cooking. Motivation assist. Dooooom.
Really digging @pallbearerdoom I'm glad I scored entry to that gig. I'm keen hearing this.
So much lethargy the last few days. Bed is a large portion of my thinking. I have to barge through everything.
Flight to Brisbane booked for 21/6 and tickets to @pallbearerdoom acquired for the same night. :) #doom &amp; #goodtimes
Got a bit of a lift from tonight's gym session. Any is a plus currently. :)
Pallbearer touring around the time I go to Qld. That could be an option. I might need to listen to them more first.
I think the reduction has caused a bit of a reaction this time. I'm not right atm. Obviously. Will keep at it. üëç
It might just be exaggerated by my tiredness and irritability currently. Sunday night too...
I really need to be more mentally refreshed, because currently I'm not ideal around anyone else let alone myself lately.
https://t.co/yWGhXNQpgc Windir - Arntor, ein Windir. I've always thought of this clip to rate highly on the epic scale.
Watching Ritchie Benaud: A Marvellous Life on @WWOS9 .The stories, interviews and tributes. Touching really. Wow. #RIPRichie
A win is a win. The last quarter was a shame though. First 3 quarters brilliant. #AFLPiesCrows #gocrows
Hang in there, Smithers. @Brodiesmith33 Nasty knock. Seems it has distracted the guys a bit. #AFLPiesCrows #gocrows
I'm trying to keep a lid on it, but it's not easy! haha. #AFLPiesCrows
The scary, yet good thing for @Adelaide_FC about this is there's still room for improvement! :) #AFLPiesCrows
Invited to a house shindig other side of town, but I really don't have it in me. Couch and #AFLPiesCrows seems more ideal. #hermiturge
Visit mum to drop off something, walk out with a homemade pizza from her. Dinner served and consumed. üçï
2 for 22, marvellous etc will ring in the ears of cricket followers for years to come. He'll be missed. @CricketAus @WWOS9 #ripritchiebenaud
I grew up watching @CricketAus lead by the commentary of one, Richie Benaud. Cricket is at a loss, but his memory will live on forever. #RIP
It's not a great sign when you're over winter about 7 weeks before it's even due to begin.
http://t.co/1eUk5vJGOm
Keen for my pt training soon. That's what I've missed from the long weekend. Too much abuse.
haaah..Basically. Just gotta get on with it, really. Walk that shit off. (Love this pic btw) http://t.co/8fm5snZ0wl
I'll get through this turbulence, but my word, I'm rattled today. Swatting off self-defeating thoughts left, right &amp; centre.
This whole day has a foul odour to it, which has seeped into my brain. It must be some kind of Easter comedown. Make it end.
What a game! üòÉ Immaculate display from @Adelaide_FC #AFLCrowsNorth
I probably would have gone to AO today if I had $$. I'm definitely keen to see how @Adelaide_FC go. Go well, fellas! #weflyasone #gocrows
Things on my mind I'd rarely have the guts to speak up about. On that note, bed. #Zzzz
Ah, beer, my one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will.
Dodgy microscopic phone camera shot. Awesome. #lunareclipse http://t.co/T8qvDUsyE6
https://t.co/sbvQSt4T0T This guy knows his shit! @dvntownsend
Off on a hike tomorrow to experience more of nature's wonders. üëç
All aboard the tigger train again. Such a quick transition from cricket to AFL. Winter is coming. #AFLBluesTigers
What a fucking day! Foot on the throttle from ball 1. Work spazzing out before Easter, but I conquered it due to my awesomeness.
2 hours worth of intense cardio and body weight exercises would be a good reason for it.
I drank approx 5 litres today. Sorry @ShaneWarne it wasn't from the thirst you were thinking of. #water I'm surprised I'm not a fountain.
I'm learning to actually feel proud of myself for achievements, rather than criticise what I haven't done. Often really self-critical.
100kg squats x 10, 280kg leg presses x 10 and 110kg deadlift x 10. Improving each week so far. Feels good, man.
Last night's adventure. #spacebong #bonghuntertour #blackenedsludge #doommetal #crownandanchorhotel‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TRT38pMUGp
And congrats @CricketAus ! And bad luck @BLACKCAPS well played. #CWC15Final
You beauty!!! So glad Smith hit the winning runs! What a tournament. Smiles all round.  #AUSvNZ #CWC15Final #GoGold üèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜ
Respect, Pup. @MClarke23 What a way to end a ODI career. You champion. #CWC15Final #AUSvNZ #GoGold http://t.co/ZnOpY6G6DM
No questions about my plans for today. Great conditions at the @MCG for cricket. #CWC15Final #AUSvNZ #GoGold @CricketAus
I stepped foot out the door, that was the hardest part of all. I'm actually on my way out now... Wow.
Mornings are starting to get fresh. This was a decent surprise though, so I caught a quick snap on the job. üëç http://t.co/Sr5i92zseD
A really satisfying win that one for @CricketAus @stevesmith49 is simply class and great bowling/fielding pressure. #AUSvIND #CWC15 #GoGold
#AUS to bat first! May the boundaries flow and the sixes soar! #AUSvsIND #CWC15 #GoGold
Getting a glimpse of winter already, it seems. Calm the fuck down, it's still March.
Two hours worth of intense boxing &amp; cardio tonight. Fitness held up well considering.
What. A. Game. Feel for the Saffas, but NZ handled the pressure better. üêë #NZvSA #CWC15
Well, Miller made that last 5 overs interesting. 49 off 18. Mad hitting. Now, I'm off to gym. #NZvSA #CWC15
Watching Passenger 57 with ol' Wesley.
Both @Adelaide_FC teams victorious today over the pear. Always satisfying. Well played, fellas! #AFL #NABChallenge #gocrows #weflyasone
Great day @TheAdelaideOval ! Well played again, @CricketAus . One of the best days I've had for ages! #AUSvPAK #CWC15
Game on! @TheAdelaideOval #AUSvPAK #CWC15 http://t.co/1GVp6h3cjL
High anticipation for heading to @TheAdelaideOval for #AUSvPAK tomorrow! Ready to indulge in the annual leave day! #CWC15
I really hope the 'Desh make something of this chase. Last night was a let down. Tough going though. #INDvsBAN #CWC15
Muscular aches = success. I may as well keep investing my time and focus on training hard to keep my mind on track. üí™
Took a step towards being medication free for the first time in over 10 years. I've had enough of feeling imprisoned. No more. üëç
After some sacrifice, I've paid that whopping electricity bill off. Take a walk, buddy!
One more morning of it to get through.
That was a shitty sleep. A common occurrence when I'm required to start at 5am.
Night of the burning quads, courtesy of a pt leg day. Pleasing feels. Put me to sleep now.
Work done. Not really sure what to do with myself this weekend now, given the 4 outstanding bills I have piled up...
First look at @Adelaide_FC tonight. Promising signs, but extremely wasteful! Many kinks to iron out before the season starts. #NABChallenge
Hit with 4 mega-bills in a week. Youuu c... Time to have no life again for a few weeks.
It looks like I've scored a ticket to the quarter final of @Iccwordcup15 at @TheAdelaideOval for @CricketAus vs TBA. Keen. #CWC15
First game of tennis for 4 years, but I don't want to talk about it... It showed.
So much on my mind lately. Plans and decisions to be made on top of getting through every day life.  A little stumped. I need more sleep...
Good thing I got home in time to see the @Gmaxi_32 extreme batting clinic. #AUSvAFG #CWC15
Monday morning skies firing up on the horizon around 6:45am. A solid start to the week. http://t.co/Gfd7MyWeg4
Witnessed a thrilling, low scoring cricket match. NZ win, but @CricketAus did well to make 152 difficult thanks to @mstarc56 #NZvAus #CWC15
Soreness engulfs the body. The pleasing results of pushing myself to max. Exhausted. zzz
What a run chase by @Irelandcricket at the Gabba. Right down to the last over. Great viewing! #IREvUAE #CWC15
I have leave confirmed for June/July to go to Brisbane again. Just the flights to decide on now.
I really don't know what to do with myself today... Being financially restricted doesn't help. I'll figure something out hopefully.
This morning's pleasantries via my balcony and bringing scorching weather with it. http://t.co/U1C1w98XyE
Dare I say it, but my beard is looking to take a leave of absence shortly. It's likely the time to start again.
Aggravated my left knee slightly at gym &amp; iced it when I got home, whilst playing Pink Floyd on YouTube. Fingers crossed it heals quick!
Making steps to improve my life &amp; I thought I'd show a result of it for once. Self consciousness usually prevents it. Proud and gladly sore.
Here, have an arm. Tough session this eve. First go at dropsets. http://t.co/6xX1WpmBM2
Well batted, @AaronFinch5 ! Fine ton under pressure. #CWC15 #AUSvENG
Snuck in a random evening leg session. Forcing the motivation. #feelsgoodman
I got a couple of cool compliments from randoms whilst at Semaphore yesterday. Every little bit helps.
Many well wishes to Radar @brentcreilly_3 as he recovers from a fractured skull. Never a good thing to hear. @Adelaide_FC
Just walking through this sea froth to close out the weekend. It's pretty sweet, really. A long‚Ä¶ http://t.co/4TwF1D91TD
Watching a doco about cricket in Christchurch &amp; the rebuild after the quakes with a few cold beers. Good on them. @BLACKCAPS #NewZealand
Apparently caused by never turning my phone off. Oops, but fair to say I was very relieved after. Action packed Friday.
Phone crashed yday morning. No response to charger, take it to Telstra store. Attendant resets phone - fixed. Few anxious moments there.
Rest in pieces credit card of over 11 years! #financialmilestones http://t.co/0ITWGTDQRX
Sore this morning. The rewarding aches from hard work! Although, getting out of bed is tricky.
Breezed through my thump session tonight. Health &amp; fitness is probably the main thing that validates my worthiness as a person.
First official PT session today and straight into legs. Technique was solid though, happy with that.
Game. Set. Match. The @DjokerNole ! Great player. #AusOpenFinal @AustralianOpen
Bier zeit! #schutzenfest #bier #adelaide #sunset http://t.co/MqwRex19df
Off to Sch√ºtzenfest like a nigel. Bier stein zeit.
This Berdych/Murray encounter is shaping to be a battle. First set went ages, then Murray dobbed to the ump about trash talking lol #AusOpen
A tense/exciting way to end the @BigBashLeague , last ball. Bad luck @BrettLee_58, great career. Best team won. @tensporttv #BBL04 #BigFinal
Felt a lot fitter after my two one hour sessions tonight. I've lost 3kg since my last weigh in too, as long as it's not muscle loss.
On top of all the bills again also. Sweet. ‚úî
Congrats to the @Socceroos for making the @afcasiancup final. A solid effort after 2 early goals. #AUSvUAE #AsianCup2015
I'm pretty sure I just cleared my highest ever payday this week! It brightened my day a little. $$ #kerching
BBQ and beer thing for #AustraliaDay done, pity about the cricket being drenched though. Time to open a bottle of red?
Good one, Sydney. You party pooper. Rain wouldn't have happened if it were played in Adelaide like before, @CricketAus ! ;) #AUSvIND #WWOS
Semifinal of the big bash. Picturesque viewing regardless what happens. @unusualreply #bigbashleague‚Ä¶ http://t.co/UYgLgEK6Ee
And 8 and a half hours later, work is over! Delayed, but time to enjoy these 2 and a half more days!
Stuck at work longer than I was first told I was going to be. Fml. Overtime thoughts are wearing thin. #deceived #krustywantsout
Just another Smudge @stevesmith49 ton. Nice Haddin cameo too. A great chase by @CricketAus to call it a night on. :) Phew. #AUSvENG #WWOS
Sure thing, giant beer! Long weekend cometh! (after a brief work stint tomorrow) #henninger‚Ä¶ http://t.co/vminC2zkC0
Why the fuck did I put my hand up to work tomorrow morning? It will pay for long weekend activities though, that's probably why.
Ticket confirmed for the @StrikersBBL semi final clash at @TheAdelaideOval  tomorrow! #BBL04 #strikeforce
Physically and mentally shot. That's what I get for pushing my workouts to the limit! Fucked, but that's how I improve. Ugh üëä
Had a meal plan emailed through to me tonight by my pt. Life is about to pick up!
"Not feeling good C.Gull, but he saved 2 runs." @bowlologist after a seagull got winded by a cricket ball. Tough bird is up though! #BBL04
