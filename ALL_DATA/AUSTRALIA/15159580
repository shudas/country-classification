A bit less cold now
Why am I so cold?
It's gremlins
#Opal card didn't open gate when tapping off, next gate gave "already tapped off" error, staff claim they can't open gates. Go SydneyTrains!

Four buses with 'closed' Opal readers in a row - state transit's solution to people rorting the system with short lunch time trips?
Oh Laura stop panicking it's only out-bound calls
Thanks @sydneybuses for having the 438 fly right past us despite hailing it! So convenient to be left by the side of the road in this weathe

1.5h train trip treated by Opal as two default fare journeys. Tap on was recorded as having no tap off, tap off was counted as a new trip.
Forgot to tap on with my opal card, oops. What's the procedure then you reckon?
Something is happening down at the V by Crown construction site - three ambulances, a fire truck, cops, &amp; an emergency evacuation by crane.
Why would you eat fried chicken on a packed peak hour train, 100 commuters want to cut you &amp; steal your chicken
Forgot to tap off, fuck. Three years of the daily routine of simply walking out stations without barriers is hard to break. #Opalcard

Dear commuters, stop leaving greasy headprints on train windows #sydneytrains #cityrail
To the woman in the #Optus call centre dealing with the bloke refusing to disclose his account details, his train carriage apologises.
Cumberland Line is cancelled today, but #SydneyTrains shows 'good service' on all lines. Which is it?

You can always rely on @BuswaysCtown to run 15 minutes late in the scorching afternoon sun with no shade to stand in http://t.co/MQDIk9Omip
That's a $61 weekly ticket, so not so cheap to replace. Public transport always knows exactly what to do to spoil a good day.

Day two of the new timetables &amp; we've been delayed by red signals. Top marks #sydneytrains #CityRail
Having a 23min wait at the station between bus &amp; train instead of 9min has definitely changed my connections, but not improved #sydneytrains
When the board says 8-carriage train, &amp; a 4-carriage arrives, you must wait for the people down the other end of the platform #sydneytrains
There's lots of people at Parramatta going "Where's the Campbelltown train?"
State Transit forgot to tell the 882 bus about the new timetable.
New train timetable adds minimum 45 minutes to my daily commute. Fuck it, I'll take the increased cost &amp; drive. #sydneytrains
The new SydneyTrains timetables has cancelled the Cumberland train that I (&amp; a few hundred others) catch home every week day. Wat.
Meowth that's right
Stuck at Granville. The Western Line trains are already full, while the number of people waiting to board increases.
Train on time tonight, finally made the 16:42 @BuswaysCtown 882, big accident on Broughton Street preventing us from moving. State transit!
Was on time to change from 18:39 Ctown train to @BuswaysCtown 18:42 882 bus, now stopped just short of the platform, endlessly waiting.
18:39 Cumberland line to Ctown running late as usual. Going to miss my connecting @BuswaysCtown 16:42 882 bus as usual. Onya SydneyTrains.
