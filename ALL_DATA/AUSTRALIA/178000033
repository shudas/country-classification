Abbott towards Indonesia, now Barnett towards Victoria. Don't Liberals understand "charity"? Everything is a transaction, no generosity.
So it seems that Premier Barnett (who is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history) is now taking his unpopularity with him to Canberra.

Now this is a contribution to a tax debate. This is what the BCA &amp; ACCI should discuss. https://t.co/91cQO0Ozzr
An important perspective. https://t.co/aBYdPdjJu3
Now, this is a real debate about economics. https://t.co/8KsdNYZMqp
Once again, like on tax policy, debate in Australia is out-of-step with what's happening elsewhere. https://t.co/r4yNWeZHMZ
Apparently a "fair point" is "scaremongering"!
Harvey clearly doesn't know what the Audit General contains, or even the PAC report tabled by Member for Churchlands. Deeply embarrassing.
Can't believe Harvey's answer on CCTV. CLEARLY hasn't read the Auditor General's report. Unbelievably embarrassing.
Premier looks very unhappy with the Treasurer ... No wonder!
The passing of another political giant.

To point out that Hames lied re Qantas deal: "will target potential visitors from Australia, the United Kingdom, USA, Germany and Singapore"
Just for benefit of media: Govt failed to EVEN ASK Qantas to fly to Perth when 3flts/wk were open for bid. http://t.co/ptUS7o3j7n
Fiona Huumerston wasn't an afterthought? Then why wasn't it shown in the original plans?
So Nahan's answer on Osprey village is that it only worked if the boom continued. A PPP where the Govt took 100% of risk, but no up-side.
Minister Nalder has spent much time talking about finding a site for a 2nd airport. Yet this is his answer. http://t.co/HLNaRyijiE
I hope the journalists Nahan has being backgrounding note that he actually can't answer any aspect of his "new" charging system!
So Nahan says he still doesn't know what he wants to do with electricity prices. So what has he been doing for the last 2 years?

How about people tell me why you think Colin Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in the history of WA! #mostunpopularPremierever
SERCO prison contract is only 5 yrs. Example of why FSH contract is not on commercial basis. Barnett #mostunpopularPremierever
No private company would ever enter the SERCO FSH contract. It is not done on a commercial basis. Barnett is the #mostunpopularPremierever
Colin Barnett needs to understand that that performance is why he is so unpopular. He is out of touch &amp; arrogant.  #mostunpopularPremierever
Watching Colin Barnett it is very easy to see why he is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history. No one listens to him anymore.

Barnett says he won't act until after Labor acts. In that case let us take Govt now!
The change in policy happened while Hames was Minister. Either he knew &amp; was guilty or he didn't know &amp; he is incompetent.
Puffed-up Premier's arrogance is certainly part of why he is the most unpopular Premier in the history of WA!!
For Hames benefit: he gets paid to know policy. Policy changed, did he know? If he did, he's guilty. If he didn't know, he's incompetent.
Typically of Hames: never once has he ever done the work of a Minister. His job is to ask questions, but never done.
Divisions on the board didn't contribute to the change in the policy. When did Hames know? Takes his salary, but not his responsibility.
Another Minister who doesn't get the fact that he's in charge. This is why Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history history.
Funny how Hames starts his defence by NOT talking about his own involvement.
I can assure you that Nalder's performance is contributing to Barnett being the most unpopular Premier in WA's history history!!
I can tell you Hames behaviour at Bentley Hospital is contributing to Barnett being the most unpopular Premier in WA!!!
I wonder if the poor management of WA Health by Hames is contributing to Barnett being the most unpopular Premier in WA's history?
Is the failure of RfR to deliver for ordinary country residents a reason that Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history?
I bet that Barnett not sacking Nalder is 1 reason Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history history!!
Is Hames misleading &amp; hiding on Healthways a reason that Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history history?
Is Barnett cancelling the East Perth Power Station redevelopment in '08 a reason he is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history history?
Is the fact that Hames knew for 8 mnths &amp; didn't act a reason Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history history?
Is the fact that Liberals didn't introduce mandatory sentencing when promised reason Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history?
I wonder if the arrogance of Liberal Ministers in QT is a reason Colin Barnett is the most unpopular Premier in WA's history?

Well reasoned comments. https://t.co/5VrvN5Zamc
Barnett might not have noticed but CCC showed that only 1 Minister acted against the law, &amp; that member formed Gov with Barnett!
Essentially a social event: apart from the business part. Evidence was Conran's report.
Ministerial staff are employed by Premier. Why didn't DPC find her another job?
Perth Stadium: no transport plan, but already $2bn committed. Bizarre.
Typical Barnett: re-interprets the rules to save his mates!
Also: Nalder doesn't seem to know difference between 3AM &amp; Midnight!
Dean Nalder talks about 3AM trains: that was a trial, not permanent. One more lie by a Liberal Minister in the Chamber.
John McGrath tells Dean Nalder what to say before he stands up. One gets paid as a Minister, one has the ability.
Next time Hames wants to know what the Premier said, he should watch @9NewsPerth ! Premier said workers leaving WA, not McGowan.
Nalder makes a decision, but didn't know any details of why he made the decision. Taking $ under false pretences, pretending 2 b a Minister
80 pax per service = 41,000 per annum!
Nahan never gets the facts right, he is deeply embarrassing. His attack on Gary Gray is a disgrace. He is the Peter Principle incarnate.
Nahan talks about INPEX: Premier Barnett lost that project! He said it was going to go to JPP.
