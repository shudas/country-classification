So the plan, Dr's appointment at 5:30pm, race home, watch @RuPaulsDragRace and then meet the boys for a birthday dinner #winning
Shit! I forgot to watch @RuPaulsDragRace last night. The shade of it all.

Going to be taught how to use a defibrillator. @SteveFarmiloe must be breathing a sigh of relief #FirstAid

First aid course today. Society beware.
Still in love with Finn Pulmar. #TheGoodWife
An I don't get Kennedy Davenport.
Get rid of Miss Fame. Dumb bitch
It's time for @RuPaulsDragRace 9 left
Absolutely shattered. 6 hrs sleep just doesn't cut it
Currently bored, and a new manager who likely won't be here in 6 weeks #revolvingdoor so much ambition and no hope for success
20 minutes to go. #clockwatching
ok, still on two calls for the day. Probably could have finished Scorch Trials but just couldn't concentrate.
All these people saying it's an amazing day. Well not from where i'm sitting sister. Just the gloom
Ok, so i'm trying Tinder for the first time. I reckon i've swiped left over a hundred times, and about five times right. Picky or no talent?
Now that Quade is injured, why won't @Reds_Rugby bring in Berrick Barnes? Japanese season is over.
After watching Abendanon tear apart @SaintsRugby I can't understand why he wasn't really featured in the England set up. Better than Brown
Very quiet City today. It's almost like 28 days later #eerie The gloom is adding to the effect
Good thing it's not warm and sunny today. I might have actually regretted coming into the office.
One call in two hours and that person hung up on me. Paid double or triple time to do nothing. Make that two calls in two hours.
One thing about working and not actually having work to do, I got to cull over a 100 followers that don't follow me or just don't tweet
Juat checked the @ChampionsCup and noticed that we could have a replay of the Heineken Cup final. Fingers crossed both Saracens and Toulon
