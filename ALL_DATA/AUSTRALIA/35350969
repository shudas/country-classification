RBA working with regulators to assess + contain risks in the housing mkt, so says the statement. Their worry levels appear to have risen.
That's the second month in a row where the money markets have made the wrong call on rates. The dog is wagging the tail.

More confident RBA will cut by May.
Money markets think there is &gt;50% chance of rate cut next week but not as confident as they were for a march rate cut http://t.co/fe0ichXrxG

The bears think @cjoye is on their side. Believe me, Chris is only on his side!
This whole discussion reminds me of this episode. Watch out for the bubble boys!  http://t.co/yNEDdYcylc
Now here are some facts. :-) https://t.co/ARgpfKAPTQ
Its wrong to think that what is happening in Sydney, is happening else where. It isn't.
Yet another rubbish claim designed to create fear and fame. Repeat, there is NO national housing bubble..http://t.co/7Pyn9iXSSw

Result auction clearance rate for Melbourne is around 71 to 73%. That would only suggest a moderate housing market for Melbourne.
They revised last week's Melbourne result from 79% to 75%. Yet still missing nearly 100 results over a week later.
APM had 79% for Melbourne yesterday, yet they missed well over 200 auctions..
Last week's reported 84% for Sydney was revised down to 80%. And yet they are still missing 42 results.
Real clearance rate in Sydney right now is about 79-80%. Still strong but let's not overplay this.
APM may have reported an 86% clearance rate for Sydney yesterday! however they missed 111 auction listings.
APRA receiving global attention for its dithering. http://t.co/jXI2mu2dOs
Never mind this story, there will always be a requirement for agents. DIY is fraught with issues.

Vacancy rates fell in February. https://t.co/HsI2Luq2TD
Brisbane still just recording modest price increases. The vendors know they don't yet have much pricing power. http://t.co/IfodRMZGKM
We are still struggling to see the Melb boom. The bubblers need Melbourne to take off before their thesis is correct. http://t.co/SwpV4t6mNA
Sydney still holding above $1,000,000 for the median asking price of a house. http://t.co/tkeqbONCKb
However I still think the city is getting some benefit out of the lower i-rate cycle. So it is possible Perth could still hold this year.
Seem to me there is a down trend now occurring in that city for asking prices.
SQM's weekly asking prices index has just been updated for the week. Here is the chart for Perth.  http://t.co/1ZSD29t8kO
Here are the latest charts on Port Hedland. At this time, the data does not yet suggest a bottom.
