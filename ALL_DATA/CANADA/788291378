Well. Figured out the Internet. Had to use my expert hacking skills.. Lol. Nah, just got lucky
Friggin Internet went out today. Girlfriend has the password. Guess I'll have to wait till she gets back from Cuba I suppose.
The girls are off to Cuba for the week. Gonna miss them. Kinda weird, have been alone for this long in five years.
Never fails. Goin home tomorrow after a weekend in kenora. Of course it's gonna snow
