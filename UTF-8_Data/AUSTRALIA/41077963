The players that have been selected due to suspensions would be regular starters at other clubs it's not ideal but it's not that bad either
Wrapped for Tim Browne to get a starting spot on Sunday even though if its at the expense of James Graham which isn't ideal
Now the precedent has been set by the three ring circus that is the @NRL let's see how consistent they are in the future.
Could RTS be on the next dancing with the Stars ?? #footwork

JT you are a deadset freak that is all #FACT
LA and Vegas can not come soon enough #sokeen #theboys #goodtimes #golf #shadowcreek
They should replace the death penalty with having to spend 2 hours in a room with Mark Nicholas #painful #CricketWorldCup
Apparently @ShaneWarne is thirsty #OnTheCans
