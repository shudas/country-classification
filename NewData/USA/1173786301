I love you
goodnight
I'm not up for graduation.
I'll miss him
I'll miss not seeing his face in the mornings
idk I like joey a lot and I will miss him so much when I graduate
in track i catches up to him and kept his pace. idk about you but I'm feeling pretty great about myself for that
I love to see him out of his comfort zone. it's makes me push more
it was fun I liked it a lot:)
I had a really good day with joey today:)
more testing tomorrow. yay
