I would be indebted to any of my friends going to HeroesCon that grabbed one of these for me. https://t.co/nHMXNcYJ7e
That last scene is amazing, but also the Star Destroyer and Darth Vader's mask.

I got blocked by Ricky Gervais?
Is that @NickinDallas who is my opponent this week?
If @mrs_oberts was feeling better, I'd lobby pretty hard to stay up and watch the last ep of Daredevil. It'll probably be Friday.
I can't believe they have Ben Urich pulling a @CK1Blogs and becoming a blogger on Daredevil.
I hope everyone had a great #NCBD! http://t.co/0zWis9WmeL
Big fan of @marissadraws' name change. Maybe she does a panel at the next #HotDogCon.
I'm excited for the upcoming Lil' @ValiantComics line by @JeffLemire.
It's becoming clear why @Pray4Chandler wants to come to Oregon for school.

Patiently awaiting @raylewis's hot take on #AaronHernandez.
I've been watching Miami Vice on Netflix. It's pretty good.
Part of me thought that Hernandez would be not guilty and then promptly signed by the Cowboys.
He apparently had a long day. https://t.co/MsOVnk2UkF

My wife @mrs_oberts does wedding flowers occasionally. Here is her website.  http://t.co/5D7MC11x3M
Did the Purple Man pics get pulled?
I'm okay with how this turned out. Cc: @Wasgo http://t.co/BgXmsEHzNS
Delighted to see @pattonoswalt on Veep. Hope it's all season.
Watching #GoT http://t.co/fahHketNo3
-@meganamram wrote a hell of an episode of Children's Hospital.
I don't know why this doesn't have more retweets. https://t.co/vKgodqjLWX
Is there an easy way to record a phone convo on the iPhone?
I wonder if Warner or Marvel has tried to hire Kathryn Bigelow.
I bet @AaronRodgers12 gets to see X-Men Age of Apocalypse early.
It's like @EscapePodComics knew they would be announcing casting today. https://t.co/UoFfePLZLT
I dig Olivia Munn.
It occurred to me this morning that I'm better at managing my time when I have less of it.
