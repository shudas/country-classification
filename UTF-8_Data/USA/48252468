Oh my what is the name of this track !?!? @kaskade http://t.co/sDtkmgUNYJ
. @kaskade sets would be better if he replaced the small big room bits with some sick electro hah:)
. @madeon 's live show is just awesome
Like boom. I know. Game changer.
I figured out the trick to the coachella stream.... I can rewind... Therefore I missed kaskade, but after madeon, I can go watch his set.
Also now time for madeon on the stream!?
Fuck yes GOT.
Game of thrones premiere..... I've waited so long.
