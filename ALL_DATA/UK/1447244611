Feel so sick
This last week has been the worst😪

Think that literally all my problems would be solved if I could drive
Or any time other than now tbh
Just want it to be summer already

Fucking heat wave and the bus has broke down😒😒
Should've seen this coming ages ago tbh
Hypocrite doesn't even begin to explain😴
No words😒

Every time my mood gets decent I see something that fucks it up😒
Just when you think things can't get worse😪
