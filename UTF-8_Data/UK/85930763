Fantastic and faultless performance from @NicolaSturgeon - even better than last time! Well done! #BBCDebate #VoteSNP #GE15
"I don't know what Ed is talking about" Nicola, we're all thinking the same thing! #BBCDebate
This has been an easy debate win for @NicolaSturgeon I think she has received an applause for everything that she has said #BBCDebate
I think #NicolaSturgeon is winning tonight's #GE2015 debate #SkyNewsPoll What do you think? http://t.co/Py5Wo45Hbn
Nicola Sturgeon takes on and destroys Farage - brilliant stuff from the First Minister! #BBCDebate #GE15
The audience are liking what Nicola Sturgeon is saying - applause at every turn #BBCDebate
It was a mistake for Ed to take part in this debate #BBCDebate
Strong and confident opening address from #nicolasturgeon #GE15 #BBCDebate #VoteSNP

Incredibly jealous of all those enjoying #StarWarsCelebration in Anaheim this weekend!
Spent the evening inputting canvass data and now relaxing whilst watching an episode of The Flash!
And people voted for this guy and his silly party! #scotnight
David Corburn is having a nightmare and it's fantastic to watch! #scotnight
Good press coverage today for @GavNewlandsSNP The campaign is gaining serious momentum! #GE15 #activeSNP #VoteSNP http://t.co/lKIbEUsFnr
Ad-breaks suck! #GameOfThronesSeason5 #GoTAtlantic
Time for some @GameOfThrones - missed this theme tune! #GoTAtlantic #GameofThrones #GameOfThronesSeason5
With all the activity happening today, I forgot to tell @GeorgeAdam to make some time to watch @Daredevil on @NetflixUK
#thelaurens and I out showing our support for @GavNewlandsSNP #activeSNP #GE15 http://t.co/50OnRAEi0s
Just finished watching ep 2 of @Daredevil and can't believe how dark and gritty it is for a @MarvelUK show. Great start to this new series!
The candidate and campaign team relaxing after a long - but ultimately enjoyable day on the campaign. #GE15 http://t.co/SAd5hAMqHr
Fantastic canvass results in Renfrew today - even better with the sun being out! #GE15 #activeSNP #voteSNP http://t.co/Q0xihgCRMY
Great to see @GavNewlandsSNP sign up &amp; support the @alzscot pledge #GE15 http://t.co/eOdAFJ1zMy
A busy team @GavNewlandsSNP office. Getting ready to go out for another canvass session in Renfrew. #ActiveSNP #GE15 http://t.co/UEefSPeA1d
Really looking forward to @MarvelUK @Daredevil appearing on @NetflixUK tomorrow #Daredevil
Good to see @GavNewlandsSNP &amp; @DerekMackayMSP playing their part in keeping Renfrewshire clean &amp; tidy. #GE15 #voteSNP http://t.co/8oeIJCnAyf
I think this might lead to @Douglas4Paisley losing further support in Paisley. #GE15 @mhairi1921 @kennymaclaren http://t.co/xgXdQTgWzQ
Ruth Davidson coming under scrutiny and not coping well with it. #leadersdebate
Strong start from @NicolaSturgeon #leadersdebate
Good to receive some positive leaflets through the door from @BrendanOHaraSNP He's by far the best candidate in A&amp;B. http://t.co/ZG86LWL2TF
Good to see @GavNewlandsSNP champion the rights of carers &amp; calling for more support to be provided. http://t.co/eBU9TM4DEB
Just when you thought Jim Murphy's night couldn't get any worse, up pops Tony Blair as the top headline on the News at 10 #ScotsDebates
Surprised that the audience is giving Willie Rennie such a hard time when they were so positive towards Ruth Davidson. #ScotsDebates
If people don't want a 2nd referendum, then there won't be one! Can't see why that is so hard for Pro-Unionists to understand #ScotsDebates
Jim Murphy is trying to be all things, for all people - he doesn't come across as honest or particularly value-driven. #ScotsDebates
Jst arrived back in Oban after an action-packed weekend campaigning for @GavNewlandsSNP Enjoy campaigning but delighted 2 have my phone back
Great day on the campaign to elect @GavNewlandsSNP as our next MP for P&amp;RN. The level of support for Gavin &amp; the @theSNP is fantastic! #GE15
Good day out on on the campaign with the @TheRealMcGowan - hope you enjoy your drink tonight!
It seems we're back to the 'throw enough mud and see what sticks' sort of politics! Incredibly desperate and rather shameful!
I found us a campaign theme tune! https://t.co/FS0PiNkIfw
@GavNewlandsSNP @TheRealMcGowan @ShawMhor @ThisGirl_is @jettrink_ @lindym81
I think Farage showed how he represents the worst kind of politics. Gutter politics in its worst form! #leadersdebate
Great performance from #nicolasturgeon this evening and made it look easy. I was surprised at how poor Miliband performed. #leadersdebate
The @SAUWSstudents Union looks great - congratulations to all those nominated #bigsauwsawards http://t.co/q6nV0RHyYw
Looking forward to returning to @UniWestScotland this evening and speaking at the Big @SAUWSstudents Awards Ceremony.
There are many great shows on tv at the moment but @CW_TheFlash tops them all! @FLASHtvwriters @grantgust @AJKreisberg #TheFlash
Interesting season finale to #TheWalkingDead I don't know what I'm going to do with my Monday nights now!
Just arrived back to a windy and cold Oban after attending an excellent #SNPConf with Team @GavNewlandsSNP @RandGSNP
MSP and all-round comic book fan @GeorgeAdam speaking on a motion about free school meals. #SNPConf http://t.co/86oOQ6UeUv
Fantastic speech from @GavNewlandsSNP on recognising the contribution that our carers make to wider society. #SNPConf http://t.co/KgChtu37f4
