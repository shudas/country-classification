Oh, pinterest, your joinUs() easter egg made me laugh a lot!
The fact the iPhone 6 Plus iOS Simulator doesn‚Äôt fit on my screen when it‚Äôs scaled down by 3 makes me sad. #UpgradeTime!

The awkward moment you drive by @McDonalds and their led as board is using #comicsans. As if I needed another reason not to go.
Any ideas why @middlemanapp server in terminal loads, but chrome can't connect seem to connect?
