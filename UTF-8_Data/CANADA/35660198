I don't know, @lindsayhsomers. The noon group were pretty well-behaved... (I'm not buying it.) #fit45
The #Fit45 gang rocked it to the hits of the 80s this morning, @lindsayhsomers. Such a fun group!

"@Aaron_L_Ingram: I'm an only child so eff National Sibling Day. All the other days are miiiiine!" ...and we don't have to share!
Just saw a promoted tweet about "loosing weight." How about we lose that extra o first? #dobetter
One of my favourite things about #winnipeg? "Everybody go downtown!" 15 minutes later, everybody is downtown. #littlebigcity
Important fashion question: How does the #WPGWhiteout work if we're still in the period between Labour Day and May Long?
Ahem. That's Mantario to you, sir.
And let the beards begin.
If it weren't for promoted tweets, my feed right now would be 100% hockey.
Mother of pearl.
I can't handle this. And I'm not even watching.

I accidentally wore a pink shirt on pink shirt day.
"@ianmcc: Something kinda wrong with this pic!  http://t.co/NKwpN2VZLD" Welcome to middle age, my friend.
I wore my "T Rex Hates Pushups" t-shirt to Group Power and then made them do three dozen pushups. I can't be trusted.
#TasteWpg2015 was the best! I think the gang from @deerandalmond stole the show. # awesome #glitteriffic

"@rosiepb: After all these years, Come On Get Higher is still the sexiest song." It really, really is.
Instead of running five miles, I watched a movie about a woman who walked a thousand. So, I'm good... right?
What was the age difference between Baby and Johnny? #DirtyDancing #AskingForAFriend
Not going to AC/DC is already the highlight of my fall.
That moon! #Winnipeg
I pledge to eat a sandwich. And then I pledge to take a nap. Pledging is fun.

Is anyone else watching the Interlake Polka Kings on Neepawa Public Access TV? No? Just me?
It's raining because I had my car washed at @MidtownCarWash today. #mybad
Just saw Sound of Music on the big screen. Cried all the way through. It was glorious.
Woke up to no water (thanks to a watermain break down the street), but there's enough in the coffee maker to brew a cup. #silverlining
Finally using my birthday gift card for some much-needed TLC. @UrbanOasisSpa
I kinda miss the Leather Ranch.
Sending the boy to Europe with Ziplocks and instructions to take full advantage of the complementary hotel breakfasts.

Watching the Great British Baking Show and crying because the cakes in the semi-final are so pretty. And because I don't have cake.
"@ChrisDca: Special weather statement issued for #Winnipeg and area: significant snowfall possible for southern Mb late Tue and Wed." NO.
I just watched a very fancy dog wedding on Say Yes to the Dress. There are at least three things wrong with that statement.
