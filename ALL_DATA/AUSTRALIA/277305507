3 year anniversary at #SCA today - What an amazing ride it's been so far. Thanks @mickeymaher for the opportunity #grateful 👍🏻
And the holiday is over... In denial I am going back to work tomorrow 😥👎 What am I going to do for happy hour each day now? 🔥🎾
Does ANYONE work in LA? Everyone seems to either exercise, drink coffee, shop or pretend to do something on their MACs

Americans like to drink a lot... On a school night. #fireball #dualingpianos #austin #texas
I know if my friend @HillmJulia was here we would have had several morning wines by now #boredomatLAX
Surely it's time for a wine. #boredomatLAX
For those playing along at home, I've lost Adam at LAX. He seems to be making friends with all the dogs at the airport #saveme
