Abbott talks about the "ice scourge bedeviling Australia." Yawn. Let's end the "Abbott scourge" which is debasing Australia.
The Abbott "government" proposed laws to allow private guards to beat refugees to death according to a review. WTF?! http://t.co/UdQxZV1mJE
Karl Kruszelnicki says he was deceived by the government when he agreed to do ads for the Intergenerational Report.   http://t.co/oNmf3oHOWC

Really looking forward to LNP metadata supporters realizing that it will be be very helpful to combat tax evasion. Horror expected.

Just when you think Abbott's clown circus couldn't get more surreal, you read they're planning their own miniseries.  http://t.co/7XySDzPX9Z
Ice: Abbott's new shiny thing he can look tough about, to distract voters from noticing the train wreck of a government he "leads".
So that makes two organizations our PM has been deeply involved which have covered up child sexual abuse.  http://t.co/58jMAxIf6v

Jackie Lambie teaches us all that the collective noun for a group of uneducated, unintelligent racists is a NETWORK. Thanks, Jackie.
In every state election, I always fill out all squares. Otherwise, how could I ensure Fred Nile's group is LAST? Every time.

DRM is the tool of monopolist rent seekers, book burners, media plutocrats and corrupt politicians.  Make DRM illegal.
So yes, as long as what you public concerns "news" - Wikipedia absolutely qualifies - then you're a journalist, and SLIGHTLY more protected.
"news medium" means any medium for the dissemination to the public or a section of the public of news and observations on news.
(cont'd) in the expectation that the information may be published in a news medium.
"journalist" means a person who is engaged and active in the publication of news and who may be given information by an informant (more)
So what is a "journalist" under our new metadata overlords? Well, it's defined in 126G of the "Evidence Act 1995" (more.)
Q: does editing Wikipedia articles make you a journalist under metadata retention? One convo I have had says absolutely yes, it does.
Bishop lamenting the 4U9525 death of two people born inside an arbitrary national boundary vs 148 others is implicit racism. Nothing more.
Howard misses that while Abbott was an effective op leader, he is  a disaster as PM. After the budget, he's gone.  http://t.co/GSMKbjobOs
RIP @MalcolmFraser12. Your courage in leaving the Liberal party when it lurched painfully to the right is a lesson to all.
Ten companies responsible for a third of Oz greenhouse gas emissions, every single one a major LNP donor.  http://t.co/Sf4Y9Ulsye
LNP parliamentarian: Abbott would lead them to "narcissistic annihilation". At least they what's in the lodge then. http://t.co/m89dFdFHsT
Really happy to read that @MRowlandMP and @edhusicMP spoke against the disastrous metadata legislation, and have tried to improve it.
Paid government propaganda under "The Challenge of Change". The biggest challenge is replacing the current LNP frauds with a competent govt.
I should be shocked. But no. At 2.5M currently, not even on broadband by int'l definition. Thanks, @TurnbullMalcolm. http://t.co/QK9f8X57Dl

It also makes journalists special, protected citizens. That alone is problematic. Fascinating that so many journalists fail to see that!
Under legislative changes, journalists metadata is protected. Who decides what a real journalist is? This is rife for abuse.
A pediatrician evaluates alcohol vs. marijuana use by teens, concludes alcohol is evidentially far riskier.  http://t.co/ibbJt7nzDN
Is the 5EYES fetish for metadata some future (expensive to us) bet on useful, more reliable analytics? One hopes not.
Given that worldwide no service has been able to provide metadata examples where it was critical to a LEGAL prosecution, what is going on?
AFP convinced Abbott on metadata retention, with a single example of its usefulness &amp; no clarify it was essential. http://t.co/p2144JBVJT

Let's play a synonym game: fiasco, train wreck, circus, ship of fools, joke, international embarrassment, the Abbott "Government".
Hey @TurnbullMalcolm, PM in waiting, bring back the _REAL_ NBN. Fibre to the home. You know fibre to the node is no solution, and never was.
I look forward to new PM Malcolm Turnbull, who will be knifed by his own party's fascist right in &lt; 1 year.
Is it 26/6/2013?  Hold on, no, the PM being deposed here is a pointless failure with a Churchill fixation. What goes around, though...
You still can't beat a UK Tory MP for saying batshit-crazy nonsense. This moron wants the NHS to use astrology. http://t.co/E1YVUcLduh

ABC no longer calling it the "Abbott Government". Now it's the "Abbott Administration". Still think it does the clowns too much credit.
Absolutely zero response from the press council about the Murdoch press and the Lindt siege. Proving, once again, the PC is window dressing.

New policy: post an anti-vac message. I unfollow. I won't follow people who advocate child abuse, which is what anti-vac is.
Industry self-regulation == regulatory window dressing.
And the most telling point: supporters of industry self-regulation are almost always detractors of regulation in general.
The concept of an industry body both promoting &amp; regulating an industry is logically absurd. Can't think of a single instance of it working!
After the sickening greyhound racing revelations last night, are we FINALLY convinced that industry self-regulation is an oxymoron?!
Had the experience of calling @apple support: Feels EXACTLY like dealing with a government department circa 1970.
Wow - a real uptick in solar rebate fraud calls recently. Its gotten to the point that the only calls I get on my fixed line are fraudsters!
Dear Santa,

I've been very good this year, and I have a special wish. Can I please have a competent press?

Signed, the Australian people.
Abbott's popularity hits rock bottom and ... Surprise!... We have an imminent terror threat. He really thinks we're idiots.
