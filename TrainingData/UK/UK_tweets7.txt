World Cup final is in December do you know what that means for Scottish Football? Celtic will be without 1 player for 2 weeks, thoughtless
Barca for the Champions League and Wolfsburg for the Europa League
I know as a collective we're pretty quiet but just before kick off can we please all hold up a banner saying #shaftedbytheSFA
I now feel a little sympathy for all the times we shaft the Celtic fans and put our home games on a 12:45
I honesty don't know if I should direct my anger towards the SFA or the TV companies, #FootballIsForTheMoney
No trains, one 06:50 bus, 3 and half hour journey, 12:15 kick-off, the other team plays in Glasgow, no surprises #ICTFC #scottishcup
Well we've got Celtic the week before in the league it's not really worked Dundee United hopefully it'll fare better for us #ICTFC
