I feel like we are slowly drifting apart and I'm the only one who sees it.
I need a new north face
Plot twist.
Today is literally Throwback Thursday 😂
The one night I actually need a ride somewhere all the cars are gone. And it's too far to walk..
Going to prom alone isn't that bad. Idk why everyone is freaking out bc they don't have a date.. just go with friends and have fun.
