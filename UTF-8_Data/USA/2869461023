I appreciate a lot in my life. I need to show it more.
Probably the best decision I've ever made ☺️
TBT to when tyler thought he could hold his liquor but surprised himself. #poorthing http://t.co/G04G9hLLnW
god, tomorrow can't come soon enough. so ready to get out of sulphur springs.
My mind won't let good things happen. It freaks out and pushes away..
I really hate my actions. Sometimes, I just really loath myself.
I'm going to have a good day. Not letting bullshit get me down anymore. Time to hold the feelings in and fake a smile.
I feel so alone in everything.
Not ready to go to sleep Bc I hate sleeping alone. Missing babe
Sleep is calling my name.
Drakes tweets are on point tonight 👌🏾
Drunk, af.
Modern family, keystone and alone time. Perfect.
Damnit, I'm high and drunk. It's a good night 👌🏽
Tad drunk, tx.
I wish I was as important as everyone else.
I wanna rock it all night babygirl will you rock it out with me? I wanna crawl through the dark just to feel your heartbeat against me.
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance, and light it up like its our last chance.
Why do i always use the words that cut the deepest when I know how much it hurts you? Oh baby why do I do that to you?
Tonight is pretty great so far.
I love it just being me and my mom, drinking beer. This weekend is going to be paradise. I need this.
30 pack on deck. Whaddup tonight?
Can only get better from here....
I don't feel like talking to ANYONE. so yes I've been ignoring everybody . don't feel special.
I'm getting drunk tonight, fuck it.
I have a lot of thinking to do this week I have alone.
I have much to say , but I don't want to start a fight..
I need something to do tonight... What's up sulphur springs ?
marry me ! 😩😩 http://t.co/CI11DAYI80
#wcw #babymomma #loml 😭😩😍💕 @LanaDelRey , i love you . http://t.co/LvfVrQhWO2
I'm so hungry it hurts... Everything I eat, I throw up. I'm tired of this shat.
All I've wanted for the past week is to be held, but that can't happen..

I'm such a pussy when I'm sick.
Been up since 3 this morning, because tyler decided we were going to bed at 8 last night.
I'm so ready for this weekend !
And now the wound has begun to turn, another lesson that has gone unlearned. But this is not a cry for pity or for sympathy.
But I used to be quite resilient, gained no strength from counting the beads on a rosary.
I'm like a jack of all trades who’s a master of none.
That all my debts will be left unpaid, feel like a cripple without a cane.
I fear I'll die from complications, complications due to things that I've left undone.
I usually hate being alone, but here lately it hasn't been a bad thing.
Forever love this song http://t.co/wwFtsejRHf
Nap time for my sick self 😷
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often.
Bitches down to do it either way, often.
You have to be happy with yourself before you can be happy with anyone else.
Good night ugly bitches ✌🏿
I want to move far away and never look back.
There is a little bit of lie behind every truth.
I just want to fucking go to sleep, to be honest.
Been throwing up for so long my back hurts 😭
Spray painting Haleigh did for me http://t.co/pHw407z4HO
My life  https://t.co/24chBsjEAK
Fuck, I'm tired of feeling like shit.
My bed is so comfortable it's scares me.
My questions have questions.
Hey, it's your girlfriend again. Just thought I'd stop by .... miss you. @Tyler_Barrett
Hey, wish you loved me @Tyler_Barrett
I FEEL LIKE SHIT 💩
Going to bed upset, what's new? 

El oh el. good night twats.
My life is a waiting game.
I need a "get away night" , alone.
I love the smell of rain 😍
Man, I hope tyler gets this job..
Man, I miss the old days. It sucks growing up and growing apart from the people you thought would never leave your side.
I just want to cuddle and be loved when I'm sick...
I've been alone all day and being alone while sick sucks.
I'm so scared that one night, when I'm alone, I'm going to try and pop my neck and break it.
I'm only with tyler because of his eyes.
Good thing I fell in love whichyo eyes then @Tyler_Barrett 😏 https://t.co/MYEkztpvaM
My drunk self always thinks about sober self. I'll smoke a whole pack when I'm drunk, but leave halves everywhere. I'm so sweet.
I'll hurt myself trying to think of something funny to say.
I can sing, but that's all I got going for me.
I'm not a funny person
I'm about to start following a shit ton of random people. I need more followers
Well, Dairy Queen drive thru it is.
Well, lunch alone. Fuck you all.
Hey there. it's just Taryn, you know, your girlfriend. Just thought I'd let you know I'm starving. Ok, luv Ya, bye 
@Tyler_Barrett
I'm coming up to your job to eat 
@Tyler_Barrett

@Tyler_Barrett

@Tyler_Barrett
No one loves me. I just want lunch, not a proposal 😒
