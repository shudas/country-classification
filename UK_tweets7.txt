Anyone that has lost touch with the inner "suits superfan" just watch 1 episode...you'll be hooked all over again!
Went to bed at 11:30 because I have work in the morning...it's almost 2 and I'm no closer to sleeping...should have got up before 3 today
Yusss that Canadian girl I fell in love with added me back on snapchat...boom! What should I say/snapchat!?
Vancouver or Toronto?
Unlucky @andy_murray
I can't even stream Videos here and it kills me a little every time I try and it just stops.
Brooklyn nine-nine is so hilarious! Please watch it so we can laugh about it all day long
So if anyone knows a Katie Findlay who I think...guessing is Canadian....let me know
I accidentally added a random girl on snapchat....turns out I fell in love...she deleted me a while back and It still kills me

Ew it was him. Why is he allowed on this debate if Clarkson was sacked?
Jim has done very well tonight
Bit ironic of Nicola to be ridiculing that UKIP guy for repeating the nationalistic approach.
Nicola loves undermining the other parties instead of answering the questions.
Why is this UKIP guy even here? May as well just have dead air. Nobody's listening.
Will probably be missed more than I will.
The biggest thing to come of me leaving is that my mum will notice that stuff doesn't get done before she comes home.

Fair enough you don't like @theSNP - but abandoning all of your political values and voting Tory? #GE15 #SNPout
Tactical voting: vote for A cause you hate C. Why on earth would any labour centre left vote Tory to keep out SNP?! #madness #GE15
Everyone in Ross Skye Lochaber respects everything Charles has done, but I think we need a fresh face in Westminster @IBlackfordSkye

What on earth was Scott Brown thinking there? Got himself out of a hole with the penalty save.
Stunned by that quick defeat for @DRkneevil. Didn't quite look right before the fight started to me. Confident it's a one-off though.
Morton subs: Scullion, McKee, Miller, Ferris, MacDonald, Adam (gk).
Morton (442): Gaston; Kilday, Crighton, Lamie, Russell; J. McCluskey, O'Ware, Forbes, S. McCluskey; McManus, Caldwell.
David Templeton and Lee Wallace must rue the day they decided to join/stay with Rangers. Such a setback for their development as players.
Another big win for Livingston tonight. Delighted for David Hopkin.
Well done on the hat-trick tonight, @thomasorr8!
Surely Arquin isn't pronounced 'Arkan'. I keep thinking on the Serb warlord every time the commentators mention him.

can't put into words how bored I am
only studied for about three hours today but it's just made me shit myself for exams and i need fkn out
keep having to remind myself that after gourock tonight I'm going home and not to red like why
it's so shit that alcohol costs money like why
swear to god I've changed my plans for tonight about 47 times
fs kenya from rhoa is a puuuuure bitch
would my bank balance appreciate going out in gourock and then red tomorrow??? 4 weeks without red would be so wrong

#RAWLondon tonight, one of the rare occasions I'll tune in.
Just found out my Dissertation isn't due until the 15th of May. Can take a breather ha!
Sent away my final essay of 4th Year, just the Dissertation to finish now.
It's not even a game, may as well abandon it and award the W to the Celtics
Reminds me of how they played circa 2010.
The Cavs are just shocking.
So turned on ESPN and its Tennis, get this tae fuck I want the Cavs/Celtics game!!!!
2 people followed me // automatically checked by http://t.co/T6Q0gHLk2J
Cavs/Celtics game starts at 20.30, typing up some of this essay in the mean time.
#CHERRYBOMB drops tomorrow, buzzing to hear it.
Draft done for this N.I. essay, and its calculated at 4,400. First time I'm waaay over the word count. GTS time.
Best get cracking on this N.Ireland essay.
My horses weren't even close fs haha!
Bollocks.
Watching Punk/Cena from MITB 2011 before the Grand National. Still probably one of my favourite matches. #SummerOfPunk
Fucking animal activists, acting as if the horses are getting slaughtered, everyone's entitled to their option but give it a rest.
Fs, Spurs win, even though Harden was fouled the last second, Rockets were robbed.
James Harden is the man in this game, plus his beard is EPIC!
finally Smith is off, 58% from FT is shocking.
Make the shot count, that was incredible.
Josh Smith is so baaaad at free throws, I could make them!
Rockets deserve to win this just cause of the actions of the Spurs players.
Some of these decisions are ridiculous, spurs players falling over when barely touched, shocking.
3/5 chapters done for this dissertation done, getting there.  Rockets/Spurs game until I KO!
Pieced together my Methodology, and tbh its completely thrown me off, just reads like a pile of shit :/
Cigarettes, caffeine, munch and I should be set.
Two new hats arrived, delighted with my purchase.
