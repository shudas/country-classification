Actually felt fine about starting work at 9 but this walk has just killed me off 😩🙈
Still feel sick and I'm back in work at 9. Perfect 👌🏼
Feeling the need to run away from my till every two minutes to vom is not what I need in my life right now
Jokingly singing horribly and Connor shouts "shut up" from downstairs. He's just jealous 😂
I do actually admire young mums but two children when you're barely an adult yourself is just ridiculous, especially when you're not mature
Pregnant with your second child at the age of 19 or whatever. Congrats 👍🏼👏🏼
Getting to see Connor for like an hour a day for a week because he's working all week and I'm working all weekend is not what I need rn 😩👫
Asked Connor make me some toast and I can smell burning 🙈 you're supposed be a fuckin chef!!!!! 😂😂😂
