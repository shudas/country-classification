The kids came to play tonight Pillar, Travis and Pompey @BlueJaysVillage @BJsFans @BlueJays #Bluejays #ComeTogether #bringontheyouth
That is one of the most impressive catches to take a hr away ever by Kevin Pillar @BlueJays #holyrap @BlueJaysVillage @BJsFans
#BlueJays so all the TV personalities speak that Castro and Osuno as biggest surprises this year for me its Travis hands down. He belongs!!
#BlueJays Osuna gets his first #whiff at home. Good for work a 20 year old who looks like a seasoned veteran @BJsFans @BlueJays
#whiff number 5 for @RADickey43 #BlueJays #ComeTogether @BJsFans @BlueJaysVillage @BlueJays and to boot three up three down
#whiff that makes 3ks for @RADickey43 good start for the king of the knuckle #BlueJays #ComeTogether @BJsFans @BlueJaysVillage @BlueJays
Couple of ducks in scoring position for @BringerOfRain20 first home about. #BlueJays #cometogether #gojaysgo
RA with a #whiff @BlueJays #BlueJays #sitdown
Wow one of the loudest cheers was for Navarro. I love @russellmartin55 but glad #BlueJays fans didn't forget what he did last year for us!!!
Watching the @BlueJays home opener and nice to see @GreggZaun and @SNETCampbell  back together in the Dome #cometogether #gojaysgo

The @BlueJays battery tonight of Norris and Martin look great tonight. Now we to stop pulling a Lawrie and quite striking out!!!
Alright @BlueJays hopefully the bullpen issues are yesterdays news. Let's beat them #Yankees go Norris
So it was great to watch a little @BlueJays baseball yesterday, glad @Sportsnet had it on TV yesterday, but kinda glad they did not today

After the news I got my @LeithDunick I'm going to cry myself to sleep. #TBCC #Tbay #tbayvotes
Seriously #Tbay we voted Tamara as number 6. If you see my previous tweets with @LeithDunick you'll understand. I have lost faith in #Tbay
"@MitchCurtis21: Win or lose good campaign by @LoganOllivier Still a standup guy in the end. Have a beer buddy"
"@LeithDunick: @raybarnwell @tbnewswatch yes. Hobbs wins" that's my third basemen with the truth
Here's hoping the #Skittles are free flowing tonight. Need a big game from #Lynch #Beastmode #MNF #Skittlesv#Touchdowndance
Someone tell #BuckandPAt that they have three #NHL teams in the NYC area, not two, please?
I love my #BlueJays , but why do we have to play down to worse teams. We have done it all season, but why? ARG!!! #Frustrating
Eat that #Gibbons. Rasmus can't hit eh? Put me on the bench. Cosby with a no doubter. @bluejays
This is a perfect fitting end to the #BlueJays season. Bullpen can't pitch, we can't hit with people on, Same problems all year #FireGibbons
#Walmart doesn't want my money, so on my way to #Futureshop to buy a tablet
#YouGottaEatHere good times. http://t.co/0Jf5TFL1CQ
So quick question does Buck ever check his facts before he talks? Edwin takes over second place with 21 homers, trails Cruz who has 21? Huh?
