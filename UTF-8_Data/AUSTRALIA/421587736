For me @AntDavis23 is now a SUPERSTAR. Stats, status and skill all in balance. Box-office, with worldly talent. Produces BIG!
#Pelicans
For idiots to realise why @StephenCurry30 is THE REAL #NBAMVP THIS YEAR!!
#DubNation  https://t.co/342HkPtwLZ
#NBAMVP : @StephenCurry30
#COY : @SteveKerr 
#DPOY : @deandrejordan6 
#6MOY : #LouWilliams
#MIPOY : @JimmyButler 
#NBAAwards
No brainer @hazardeden10 wins this. @StephenCurry30 syndrome, best player on best team. Been class all year!
#PFA  https://t.co/MCSA1QnINi
Easiest possible destination to #NBAFinals for @warriors this year. Should sweep @PelicansNBA and dominate @memgrizz or @trailblazers !!
Should be the BEST #NBAplayoffs series of the past few years. CAN NOT WAIT!!
LETS GO BULLS!!
#GetHyped #BullsNation
Cmon Russell, it was clear you DESPERATELY wanted this as well. Own it now, please. Laterz‚úåüèΩ https://t.co/z5lNpZU0oL
One of the best post game interviews I ever seen, love #AnthonyDavis humble nature. Not long before the SUPERSTAR status!
#NOLA
Nooooo @chicagobulls stick to the gameplan. Get absolutely drubbed today please. We want to beat @ATLHawks in #NBAPlayoffs not today!
KEEP IT UP GUYS, make sure you LOOSE tonight at all cost!!
#BullsNation  https://t.co/cep5sEPtLO
My @chicagobulls better LOOSE today in order to make #EasternConferenceFinals this year. Seed 3 will have us face @cavs in thats why!
#Bulls
You'd still back @FCBayern to tear @FCPorto to shreds at Allianz next week. RELAX!
#FCPFCB
Absolute BEAST!
#Suarez #PSGBAR
Is that an Indian flag exactly opposite to Diego Simeone direction?!
#AtletiRealMadrid
Referee has been superb so far. Buying none of this weak stuff from both teams. Awesome flow to the game!
#AtletiRealMadrid
Modric bossing midfield. This is prime @Cristiano territory. COME ON CR7!
#AtletiRealMadrid
Is @jamesdrodriguez ambidextrous?
#AtletiRealMadrid
Next foul should get @MarioMandzukic9 a yellow. Too many rash tackles already!
#AtletiRealMadrid
Whats got into @vinodkambli349 now? Whatsup with the foul language bruh?
#IdiotOlympics
Aghhhhhh @GarethBale11 gotta put that away son!!
#AtletiRealMadrid
Bags of spaces behind #RealMadrid midfield already. @atletienglish know what to do here!
#AtletiRealMadrid
COME ON REAAAL!!
#AtletiRealMadrid #HalaMadrid
Now is the PERFECT time for @Cristiano to perform vs Atletico tonight. Has been VERY POOR last few times!
#UCL #AtletiRealMadrid
Finally some #UCL action!‚öΩÔ∏è
#ATMRMA
Only if @Jaboowins had @JordanSpieth maturity level, the whole Number 1 #NFLDraft pick debate would be put to sleep AGES ago.
#FSU
Congrats @JordanSpieth on the FANFUKNTASTIC #TheMasters victory. Such a role model, at tender age of 21. BUG FUTURE AHEAD‚õ≥Ô∏èüëèüèæ
#UnderArmour
Any chance I could see @TigerWoods today at #TheMasters ‚õ≥Ô∏è or is @Channel7 going to show Mickleson/Speith &amp; Rose only?
All about @JSpeithPGA at Augusta, Georgia today. Never been a golf fan but high praise for this young stud has glued me to TV‚õ≥Ô∏è
#TheMasters
Although I do think this was the PERFECT opportunity for #DD to send in @YUVSTRONG12 to beat up on #RR instead of @jpduminy21 here.
#DDvsRR
Not bad this. Finally someone stepping up for @DelhiDaredevils now. All about consistency. COME ON DILLI!
#DDvsRR
#SaveTheInternet
Really starting to like @UnderArmour gear now. Might jump the bandwagon from @Nike to them REAL SOON if they continue with SUPERB STUFF!
Dont think @jemelehill will read or react my tweet, but I'm a fan of yours from Australia. Just appreciate your knowledge. 
#ESPN
Thats horrendous. Jordan Speith throwing this away. In the crowd,REALLY?!!‚õ≥Ô∏è
#TheMasters
Can @7Mate_TV PLEASE PUT @TigerWoods ON THE TELECAST ALREADY‚õ≥Ô∏è
#TheMasters
Shot son, Rose‚õ≥Ô∏è
#TheMasters
TIGER!!! https://t.co/h3DmwZDzP6
I'm assuming thats 2 bad misses by top 2 players, Mr Spieth &amp; Mickelson. Can only help my man @TigerWoods I guess.
#TheMasters
Despite of having 0 knowledge about golf apart from GET BALL TO HOLE, I find this #TheMasters telecast entertaining!
#TeamTiger
Ohh just checked @TheMasters @twitter handle and found @TigerWoods only moved into top 10. Nothing exciting.
#TheMasters
Seen a lot of @TigerWoods pro tweets from #Masters this morning. Not a gold fan AT ALL but any chance of the legend winning?
Typical #BrendanMcCullum innings. Perfect hand-eye coordination. Below but in same class as GREAT @virendersehwag now.
#CSKvsSRH
What an innings!
#BrendanMcCullum #CSKvsSRH
Hahaha almost no way for @ImIshant to not be trolled https://t.co/O5MAq7zlow
MURPHYYYY WHAT A AHIT SON!!
#AFLEaglesBlues
Typical Carlton this....
#AFLEaglesBlues
Good start lads!
#NAVYBLUES #AFLEaglesBlues
3 tasks for @chicagobulls offseason :
Sign #TomThibodeau 
Sign @JimmyButler to a MAX
Keep Aaron Brooks
#BullsNation
Great win for my @chicagobulls today. Down 18 at Q2, never easy to overcome the deficit. Only @drose needs to stop them J's.
#CHIvsMIA
Wouldn't be surprised if @StephenCurry30 continues to break his #3PointRecord every year from here on. Can only get better as a shooter!!
95-96 had @Jumpman23 as the best player on best team, similar to now. MJ got the MVP, only fair to award @StephenCurry30 now?
#MVP
Chef Curry at his FINESTüèÄ
#PORvsGSW
I wish @Gen_VKSingh could do the same for state of UP, what he has done to rescue those people from Yemen!
#Leadership
Just a casual finish by KING @msdhoni here in Chennai. So effortless and CLUTCH!
#CSKvsDD
This is boys against men already, and then @jpduminy21 decides to put #CSK in to bat first tonight vs MY #DD with ATROCIOUS bowling!
#IPL
Is @DelhiDaredevils match #CSKvDD going to be telecasted live on #GoCricket @YouTube account?
#Dilliboys
No Matthews, Shami, Khan, Iyer for #DD tonight. Come on now, thats 40% of our starting 11. No chance tonight vs #CSK but hope for best!
Current @DelhiDaredevils situation reminds me of ineptitude @nyknicks and @Lakers are going through. Terrible teams in biggest markets!
#IPL
Dont like this @DelhiDaredevils squad but being a huge @DelhiDaredevils fan from heart forces to support them. BIG START TONIGHT LADS!!
#DD
No need to find #PoonamPandeyKaHero because with @iPoonampandey as the lead actress any movie will be an absolute waste of time!
#bollywood
Morkel cranking it UP!
#KKRvMI #IPL
Dont agree with @GautamGambhir decision to put #mi in to bat. Not much in this pitch for #KKR pacers!
#KKRvMI #ipl
Rohit feasting on Umesh here. Different batsman this lad, on Indian pitches. Almost unstoppable!
#KKRvMI #IPL
Are @DelhiDaredevils &amp; @IPL matches going to be telecasted on youtube in Australia?
#IPL8
Please #CoachPopovic put @kawhileonard on @russwest44 already. Bren waiting for this matchup for days!
#SASvsOKC
Perfect time for @BigJah15 to enter the #NBAdraft now. Just like @AntDavis23 post #NCAAChampionship W. Should be #1 to Knicks!
#BlueDevils
Well done to @UWBadgers on a great #NCAAChampionship season, been AWESOME. And to my @Duke_MBB WE THE #NCAAChampionship BABY!!
Woooooo
WE ARE THE CHAMPIOOOOOONS!!!
#Duke
Along with #NCAAChampionship game I have found @MarielStoll who is the 2nd best thing to come across me today. Absolute gorg!
#beauty
TYUS JONES!!!
#DUKEvsWIS #NCAAChampionship
I urge EVERYONE to go watch #FastAndFurious7 if you haven't already. Bit unrealistic but pure class nonetheless.
#PaulWalkerTribute
Cometh the hour, COMETH THE MAN JAHLIL OKAFOR!!
#DUKEvsWIS #NCAAChampionship
THATS MY BOY JAHLIL!!
#DUKEvsWIS
Expect Grayson/Tyus to exploit a few genitalia over the next few days if #Duke win the #NCAAChampionship today!
#BlueDevils
Lets stay in lead now, Duke!
#BlueDevils #DUKEvsWIS #NCAAChampionship
TYUS JONES DAGGGEERR!!
#DUKEvsWIS
This is such a GREAT game. 2nd BEST üèÄ I watched this year, after #CAVSvsSPURS few weeks ago!
#DUKEvsWIS #NationalChampionship
HAHA!! https://t.co/W8vBLkwcxj
Kaminsky ALL OVER Okafor!
#DUKEvsWIS
Why isnt @DangeRussWilson at the #DUKEvsWIS game? I thought he was a #Wisconsin fanatic.
#SeahawkNATION
Please #Duke give @BigJah15 a chance at low post. No way Kaminsky/Dekker are able to guard him without help. Double team, TREY ALL DAY!!
Not sure why #Duke cant guard Kaminsky at all. I mean its not like he's @KingJames or something. Put a body on him!
#DUKEvsWIS
CMON #Duke gotta crash those defensive rebounds. TO &amp; rebounds always the key to winning!
#DUKEvsWIS
Perfect opportunity for @BigJah15 to lock that #1 spot in #NBADraft in May. LETS GO BLUE DEVILS!!
#DUKEvsWIS
LETS GO DUKEüèÄ
#DUKEvsWIS
Everything working for @cavs right now. Call it the day lads. 
#CHIvsCLE
Its all working for @cavs tonight. Just one of those games. One thing about #TomThibodeau team is they ALWAYS compete. CMON BULLS!
#CHIvsCLE
Oh wow, clash of the titans today. PLEASE GET #CharlesBarkley TO ANNOUNCE #PHIvsNYK TODAY!
He'd rip em' all to SHREDS!
#Chuckster
Dont think anyone can compete with @cavs if they continue this defensive intensity. Offense no problem, just read the roster. 
#CavsNation
Haha @TheRealJRSmith just taking the piss right now. Would love if he could shoot his way to #NBAFinals and then get shot by Curry!
Only thing I don't like about #TomThibodeau is how he drives @JimmyButler into the ground. Let him rest a lil' coach!
#CHIvsCLE
I'd lose 40% interest in @chicagobulls if management drives #TomThibodeau out of #ChiTown who has trucked us to W's without MVP!
#BackCoachT
Just not the same defensive team, Chicago!
#CHIvsCLE
How much #NBAPlayoffs2015 #NBALeaguePass going to cost?
JR SMITHüèÄüî•üî•üî•
#TeamSwish #CHIvsCLE
The #NBAdraft really depends on how the ping pong balls fall tbh. If @Sixers somehow get it, pick Mudiay/DeAngelo. Otherwise, Okafor!
Apart from finance is there another reason for @LFC to get in @ChampionsLeague next year?
Best we could sign was Lallana, OVERPRICED.
Simply idiotic if @LFC are blaming @sterling31 saga for last night #ARSLIV loss. He was clearly our best player on pitch, #afc just BETTER!
Good to see my @Duke_MBB vs RED HOT @UWBadgers for the #NationalChampionship game. Clearly 2 best teams so far. Congrats!
#DUKEvsWIS
Congrats to @UWBadgers on their win vs @KentuckyMBB in #NCAAFinalFour looking absolutely brilliant inside out. Dekker/Kaminsky tough!
Why does my online stream work PERFECTLY till the match comes on?
