It's 7.05am on day 2 of @ChampionshipsRR and still no update from @RISA_Updates about today's track conditions or latest scratchings
Been a super first half @sydneyroosters V @brisbanebroncos 
Fast game
@WWOS9 cameraman/director/production doing a fantastic job
Gee COLES $2.5 million fine for misleading its customers over pre-baked bread was handled very quickly by a few news services

I'm 43 &amp; yesterday was the most fulfilling day I have had in my entire life
It's deep &amp; unlike me but it was amazing
#differentoutlookonlife
Tell me what was all the rubbish Saturday and yesterday about ITS SOMEWHAT running?
@RNSWStewards http://t.co/PJ8BxhhXgT
MORIARTY and Its Somewhat out of Doncaster
Kermadec won't run in Carbine Club if misses start in DONCASTER
Information supplied by @RNSWStewards regarding Randwick today

Heavy 9 penetrometer 6.18.    
Heavy dew/fog  
fine overhead
Sweet Idea to be withdrawn from the $2.5 million T J Smith today 
@atc_races @ChampionshipsRR 

Still cracking sprint with LP, TERRA &amp; chuat
Do the Newcastle wingers know when it is last tackle?
Four times caught with ball- no attempt to try something 
@BuzzRothfield
Hate being critical but have you known a website to have more issues than RISA?
Down more often then up

Leads me to a funny joke......
So the @atc_races have abandoned next Wednesday's meeting set down for Warwick Farm........
Important notice though
Under the rules the scratchings from this morning will be reinstated but those withdrawn earlier remain scratched
Hundreds obviously non-racing people arriving @ Randwick not knowing races are off
Should have got message out to fashion/socialite websites
Doncaster Day has been moved to Monday
Warwick Farm meeting from Monday moved to Wednesday 

What happens to Wednesday's meeting?
Wow RANDWICK OFF
paul king on Leebaz in DONCASTER Rleased from Kembla rides        

@atc_races @tbracingnetwork @Racing
Agree with Ref
He was 60cm and clearly sees titans steal ball
No evidence to say he is wrong
@BradFittler
Good luck tipsters @ChampionshipsRR @tabcomau charity tipping competition especially @francescacumani &amp; @DavisNick_2 choosing @4tracks4kids
58% of the ball to the Bulldogs and only lead by 1
Wow
Need better attack as you won't always get that much ball
What was doing with Thurston?
Jumps in front drags back to then chase
Poor tactics...............
Should have won clearly 

@cheers100
Hearing SWEYNESSE is first emergency and KERMERDAC second for Saturday's @atc_races Doncaster  
Great race it will be

Come on Aussie come on
Manly need a goal kicker 
Can't continue to give sides that much start @Haynsie75
Congratulations @John_Sidoti 
Has worked hard for the local community &amp; schools 
Deserved victory
You'd be happy for your man @LaundyCraigMP
Dragons lead 10-0
We all have opinions but I reckon Manly get quality ball and they'll win running away
Nick Hall told connections TO THE WORLD was good and things didn't go 100% to plan but better suited back to 2000m
"Winner outstayed us"
Can someone remember Fab Fevola hanging off the fence like that before?
Thoughts and prayers with @123jack789 following a fall at Donald

If Rohit &amp; Dhawan still there at 20 overs game might be over for AUSSIES
Think I will get set for the cricket 
@WWOS9 

Maybe a few little bets at Albury
So horribly sad
A beautiful young life ended

http://t.co/GF8FvlwrDc

Keep your guard up &amp;do something about it if u see a change in someone
Am I mad- don't answer that
But I reckon @NZcricket1 are big odds at around $3.6 chasing 298 off 43 overs
This rain is as heavy as you get

@FOXTEL_Help  been offline for past twenty minutes

Had to talk to the kids.................that is a joke
Thinking of getting back into indoor cricket....
