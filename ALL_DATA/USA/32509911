My life is coming together lol how amazing
It's so nice getting everything done
Maturing &amp; really connecting with people
Debating on getting food this early morning bc of my insomnia
I mostly go to class to work on other things
Hahaha watching someone eat shit😂 &gt;
It's starting to feel like the end of the school year and that makes me sad
Successful day at the pool &amp; climbed A mountain 😍
I don't understand bshaha
When you're sober but so happy that you feel like you're rolling 😌

Crushin kinda hard

Thought I was still tripping but there is actually a duckling quacking in my dorm
Nights like this

Down to see where this goes
College is rough
I don't think I've spent a night in my dorm for a week lol
So much good food I can't eat cuz I'm not high...😭
Anyone wanna go to Coachella last minute with me? Ha ha
Nothing better than sleeping in my own comfortable bed after crashing on the couch so many times this week
Smoking til my lungs hurt
You're bragging and I'm like that's the shit I do every day lol
It's just one of those lonely nights
Need something new to come around

Found my phone underneath an idiot's couch
When my faith in humanity is restored by love &gt;
Leaving you was like leaving a lost child that I needed to help :/
You might think that you're fooling everyone but you're not

Bonding unexpectedly with people &gt;
If you're there for me when I don't even have to ask you... Believe me I notice it and treasure you more than others
Why would I keep trying to be friends with people that don't make an effort back.

In love with @CalvinHarris
All I want to do is sleep in 😭
Probably shouldn't have scheduled work almost every day of break

Stop being a judgmental fuck and get to know the person
Hating someone because they have money is like hating someone because they don't have money...
