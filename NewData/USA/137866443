How in the world can the NHL not fine Cameron?
Brian Anderson, @steve21smith and @ALaForce on Bulls-Bucks? You've got my full, undivided attention
Poor job, Mizzou. Poor job.
Wait a second. There was no alert/notification about the gunman in downtown CoMO? Dude...
OMG, Calgary!
What a comeback by Chicago
And that's a wrap.
Kiss Cam shenanigans again eh? I'll revert to this tweet from yesterday. https://t.co/UsV8gbwWet
WTF. Stay safe, CoMO. https://t.co/LyWYvCd67u
Hey remember when we were in L.A. for Game 1 of the '13 SCF, @RobertONeill31?
One OT? Puhlease.
Well this is an interesting turn of events.
That's some kind'a no call there at Bridgestone.
"OPAQUE!" - @RobertONeill31
NOT the best time to take a penalty
It's the time of year where beat writers are head of TV feeds. So my head is on a swivel outchere.
Wonderful block by Jones there. What a great hockey game this is.
Pekka Power
Anton Volchenkov: Great former New Jersey Devil
Remember to breathe, Blackhawks and Predators fans.
Blackhawk and Predator fans likely finding themselves in the fetal position.
There is always a time and a place for Dino Spumoni references.
You left my heart in pieces on the floor. So tell me why shouldn't I break some things of yours... RT @RobertONeill31: DARLING
My reaction to Darling's save http://t.co/APfeDw5jlz
It's officially the NHL Playoffs, y'all RT @RobertONeill31: GOTTA CLEAR
RT @reporterchris: Dave Cameron says "it's an easy solution" on Subban. Either he gets suspended or one of their best players gets slashed.
Blackhawks are on another level right now. Goodness gracious.
Wooooooooo boy.
Whalers reference! #LongLiveTheWhale
Would appear Rozsival redeemed himself there a lil' bit.
(Also, that Patrick Kane guy is decent at hockey)
And just like that, it's a one goal game.
Noice win, Isles. Noice win.
Hey, look, a goal
Eeesh. Darling in net?
Took this long to get a Jackie Robinson statue ANNOUNCEMENT?
Oh my.
D'oh.
Have to say - big fan of Gord Miller so far.
I can just hear @RobertONeill31 now.

"CLEAR!"
Well, the Nashville crowd is certainly hot.
Bad job by Rozsival there. Oy vey.
Wayyyyyyelp.
Furious pace to this game. Gonna be such a fun series.
There are still people cheering, aren't there?
This whole Nashville-Chicago thing is so mind-numbingly stupid.
Isles~
#yardwork
A-Rod!
I just want to get to a point where we aren't talking about how much the NHL needs to "grow" every postseason.
OK, Isles. OK.
Here we go!
Tavares and Ovechkin h2h? Yes sir.
15 more minutes you guys. 15 more minutes! #BecauseItsTheCup
And that might be an understatement.
My God. @TimBaffoe laid the SmackDown on the Predators' candy asses http://t.co/b7ThatfgKd

Yankee fans are stupid, water is wet, the grass is green, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

O_O RT @vodkalemonades: @ChrisNovakSBN caught a ball in foul ground into the tarp in left and into the stands. crazy
What did Nolan Arenado do?

"i kinda miss college football. what the hell is wrong with me"

#OneOfUs
God, I miss Robinson Cano.
#LatinoHeat #VivaLaRaza RT @Dodgers: ALEX GUERRERO GOES YARD!!!
Voshon Lenard ain't walking through that door, Heat fans. Nor Clarence Weatherspoon, nor PJ Brown.
"DE-TROIT'S BANK-RUPT" chants ring out. You can do better, Pittsburgh.
Nope. No Greene Maddux. Awwww.
I really might be about to see a Shane Greene Maddux @RobertONeill31 @kaywizz22
Cervelli's walkup is That's Amore which is hilarious really
I have once again found my disdain for bunting. It is officially baseball season.
The kiss cam and jumbotron marriage proposals: forever the most tacky things at sporting venues
Corey Hart's walkup music sounds like some New Found Glory type band. Related: Had NO idea Corey Hart was a Pirate
Last time I was at PNC, the Tigers played them, and AJ Burnett was on the mound. Tonight. They face the Tigers and AJ Burnett is on the hill
Beautiful People playing. Did not know I'd be seeing SmackDown circa 2002
Can't exactly complain about my view... http://t.co/8ypZJ45roA
