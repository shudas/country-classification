That was a good season return. #Wentworth
Time 5 Top Dog.
I want to read some books… I could read the Millenium trilogy for a third or fourth time… but I should read something different.
Wow. Some gorgeous branding here. http://t.co/ogfFRPa3cR //@noahpillans

I don’t give a.
That soup I made last night came out really good after I substituted Rice Wine for Cooking Sake.
I suppose I should go to bed now that I’ve had some yoghurt, if I have any expectations of actually waking up for my 4am alarm.
Burnt fig and salted Caramel yoghurt is weird. Like, It’s kinda gross but I like eating it and I can’t really describe what it tastes like.
Loyalty cards, on my wrist? It's more likely than you think. (this excites me) http://t.co/4lBP7imSbe
And yes, I do realise I’m an idiot.
(because, you know, planning a trip that’s months away, first step is working out what your hashtag is gonna be. #socmed)
If I work out what accent I need to use on the A, Then I’d say #Flangkong2015 - If I do end up adding Langkawi in, #Flangkawi2015
That hashtag is too long. I’ll think of something better.
I need to start investigating for hotels soon for #FlansqDoesHonkers2015 (and Langkawi)
«Checks FlightSim» Oooh. Time to Step Climb.
Oh. That twist tho.

Aaaaaand I just scared myself senseless… and my colleague. I’m okay. I just accidentally a loud noise I wasn’t expecting.
Motion sickness from the tweets in the car. Must push through for the lulz.
Ugh. 8:30pm starts kinda stuck. I hate waiting to go to work. I’d rather just get in there and do it.
Colours on the screen seem to pop more too now.
Finally updated my Wallpapers on mah phone. I’ve got a train theme now. http://t.co/yMRn4FSrFI

I’m in Miami, bitch.
The watch seems so much smaller when you’re using it which really seems to drive home how incredible the technology is.
42mm was a good choice but I’m practically gonna need to remove all of the links to fit my tiny wrists.
Just tried on a watch. That screen is absolutely beautiful
lol I got sunburnt today.
Oooh. Bustitution. &lt;Visi vest&gt;
Omg. Rage is playing the top shits of the 90s

I was gonna make beef, bacon and egg burger muffins but we had no eggs left so I substituted the egg for Brie.
