For dinner last night I had a bag a pepperoni, a grapefruit and 5 beer. Without getting into details...not one of my stronger moves.

Golf yesterday - snowblowing today. It's Spring right?
I lost another $50 to the same 78 year old, and Desert Dunes Golf Club has asked me not to come back.
Hey @jpwhite197 I got your text, but couldn't respond from Palm Desert. YES - I'll see you Saturday for @TheRedCannons show!
That same 78 year took me for another $50 today on the golf course. If I lose tomorrow it may come to blows. #IHateGolf
