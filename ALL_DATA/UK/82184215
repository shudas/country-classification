remember when pep guardiola once called eto'o a nigger and raped a female official on the touchline? shocking behaviour from him, IMO TBH.
mourinho fans using this right now. http://t.co/r1L1Ai55Hb
guardiola boiling piss on PL twitter. great stuff. hope he racially abuses dante or whoever next.
funny how guardiola's barcelona were suspected of doping but other treble or double-winning sides weren't?

VAMOS RAFA*

*benitez, of course. not that arse-fingering nonce who plays racquet-ball ðŸŽ¾
the "Busquets is better than Zidane" era is over for me. it's no longer on my bio, after having it since the barca-PSG group game.
iniesta's been a good workhorse for barcelona this season. important player.
busquets, mascherano and suarez in the champions league team of the week. nice.
i still love john guidetti. his general play is still good, despite the goals drying up.
iniesta probably won't be available for saturday. best saving him for tuesday.
stefan johansen has 'johan' in his surname name and a guy called johan is in my avi. it's official, he is the second coming of cruyff.
smh bruh @andy_murray. http://t.co/rxlxn2Olko
glad we kept griffiths after he rustled rudi skacel.
gonna miss the federer match, smh.
wawrinka's lost 910 ranking points after losing to dimitrov. as it stands, he's the world no.9 and could be lower than that soon.
24 unforced errors lmao
defending champion wawrinka's been breadsticked by dimitrov in monte carlo.
can remember some comments from 2010 from some batshit crazy http://t.co/vrvFMmp75N readers calling guardiola a racist after yaya toure left
some pretty good black players coming through la masia these days. iÃ©, adama, enguene, that goalkeeper who fucked off to ajax, etc.
god help us all if porto win the champions league.
what have the SPFL done?
some save, this. https://t.co/DqsClNV2Oj
thoughts on aaron hernandez, @mediocentroEN? i reckon he has that killer mentality that you and many others like to see in a footballer?
i genuinely believe that simon rowntree is a million times a better journalist than that fat fuck tomas roncero.
wrighty talks so much pish. however, credit to him for having so many people on a string with that many followers. he's doing twitter right.
xavi has to stay at barca, btw. he's an absolute class act. el maestro.
can also recall roma's twitter account tweeting totti's name in caps like 200 times two years ago
person behind roma's twitter account really needs to learn how quote tweet after this cock-up. https://t.co/lgvyLhZGVX
