Good, Hamilton sprays some Chinese bird with champagne. She'll be sopping damp when Lewis takes her home later #ChineseGP
Instead of fishing the race in the rain, we're gonna finish behind the safety car #Boring
Renault need to sort these engines out, it's a farce #ChineseGP
What a bloody try up the @storm #nrlcanmel
Great recovery, well done kid
Some lob shot that #Spieth
Is @JordanSpieth crumbling under the pressure? #TheMasters
what a turnaround for @IanJamesPoulter Love the guy, very honest down to earth kind of guy #TheMasters
Tottenham haha, good on you Sherwood #TOTAVL
Mickelson can jog too
I'd love to see @JordanSpieth win #TheMasters however I kind of want him to drop shots so top shagger @TigerWoods is still in contention
If you want to watch a fucked up film watch @McConaughey in #Interstellar
Bed by 10.30 on a Saturday night. First sober weekend since January #RockandRoll

#SixNations was a bit of a farce last night, all matches should KO at the same time, none of these teams will perform like that in the WC
This world cup has been incredible
Fuck my life. That's gone out of the actual stadium. #wow 110 metres
The atmosphere in Wellington looks amazing. Don't blame them with the show they're getting from @Martyguptill and the @BLACKCAPS #nz v #wi
