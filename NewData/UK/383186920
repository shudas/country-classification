Very healthy turnout at Strathdearn Community Council tonight in Tomatin. @theSNP at work in our communities. @InvernessSNP @VoteDrewHendry
Brilliant reception for @VoteDrewHendry while canvassing today. Thanks to all @InvernessSNP members and others helping #SNPGain #GE15
Douglas Alexander referred to Miliband as "the present leader" @bbcqt. Does he suggest he won't be for much longer by this referral??
#leadersdebate Willie Rennie cannot state a policy LibDems they would not be prepared to compromise on. Clear? No, thought not. #VoteSNP
#leadersdebate Jim Murphy needs to get a grip on reality. Meantime it's a rammy.
#leadersdebate @NicolaSturgeon makes the valid point: Scotland's prosperity is not, and should not, be dependent on oil. Vision = #VoteSNP
#leadersdebate Why does Scotland have no oil fund? Ask Westminster Labour &amp; Tory governments, both are culpable. #VoteSNP
It's very simple if enough Labour and @theSNP MP's vote against a Tory queens speech there can be no Tory Government. #ScotDebates  #voteSNP
#ScotDebates Under @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP are investing billions in Scottish education, new Colleges and Schools being built right now.
