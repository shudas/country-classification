The sky was really pretty last night 💕 http://t.co/Z2RWALKyZZ
But I'm not complaining about the $165 I made today 😍💰
Couldn't be happier to be going to bed right now.
All I wanted was a creme egg mcflurry 😢
Answered the phone for the first time at work today, @AlexiaPRuiz would be so proud ❤️
Going 8am-8pm straight from school to work 😴
A little worried to be writing my calc quiz in these conditions.... 😳 http://t.co/9YS4gOTAJw

Smoothie and home made granola bar 😍 #nutritious #anddelicious 👅 http://t.co/nDTN6eERGt
Two more weeks until I can do some hard core baking and go to a pez convention 😍🎂🍰🍬 #sopumped
The amount of times I knock over pez throwing something out, turning on my light or closing my window 😠 #toomany #soannoying
Biggest pet peeve is picking out a cute outfit and then realizing no sweater or cardigan goes with it 😢 #sad http://t.co/tutSQKDuSs
Just worked out so that means I can indulge at the keg tonight 😍🍴🍷
Hate my leaky water bottle 💦
Sorry can't go to school, have to spoon my dog http://t.co/H0BI42JU7U

I would be excited for classes to end this week but unfortunately I know it's not the end for me. Three spring/summer courses for me 😒🌸⛅️
Easter bunny spoiled me... 🐰 #bakingfun #pez http://t.co/TynHEU3q7G
Every Sunday morning, my parents and 2 dogs watch the show "Too Cute" about the most adorable puppies together 🐶🐶 #weloveit
Absolutely terrified right now
So excited for tonight 🐣
Also did not enjoy the black cat that jumped out from under a parked car 😱🐱 #poopedmypants
Did not enjoy scraping my car at this hour 💤 #sleeping
I love surprises and surprising people 🙊
Went to bed after 1 and I've been up since 7 😭I'm cursed with waking up early 💤
Rather excited for Easter baking 🐰🐣 http://t.co/vSrY9mthyP

Too scared to work out in my sports bra but I don't mind walking outside to the car in it ☁️🌄 #cooldown #sonice
I feel empowered I learned something super valuable in my calc lab today
Can't wait to go home and walk my beloved puppies 🐶🐶⛅️
Of course I get a severe case of the hiccups right before bed 😒
Thank you Linda for your $4.85 tip 👼 #yourock #ily

Showering after work is the best feeling ever  🚿 #mmmm #clean
Having school and work on 3 of my 4 school days this week 😒 #busybusy
So relieved that presentation is done 👼
I thought I was going to have to buy the shirt while it was on me and then go home and cut it off... 🙈✂️
#help. There is no emoji I could find that could express how I felt in that moment earlier today
Scariest moment is when you're in a change room and you try on a shirt that's too small and you fight to get it off for a solid 10 minutes
️luh my new sports bra 💪 http://t.co/bfmboqs9Bq
Haven't been to polo since 2014 🙈 http://t.co/e7qHpVd0nM
Probably not the best idea to have a nap at 9:30pm 💤
My boyfriend is the cutest human being when he's falling asleep 💕
Just won $99 on one spin on a VLT. I am shaking... 🎊🎊🎊
I have a very strong urge to ombré my hair today 🙆

Rather excited for tomorrow morning😏💪
Woke up expecting a nice $350 in my bank account, only found $150 😔 #wheresmyother200 💰😔😔😔
Found it under my minion pillow, I can go back to bed now 👼
Lost my top half of my retainer in my sleep tonight and I am frantically searching my room right now.... Can't find it 😩
Calc prof thought it would be a good idea to just stop teaching our class 2 weeks before finals ✌️#ohok #thx

I really want tacos 💃
Wow what a day to have a case study due, presentation(where I have to be dressed up), and a calc quiz 😒❄️🌀
Can't wait for bed time tonight 😻
Buddy smiles all day 😄 http://t.co/3bUDiXmaOC
The fact that I have 3 hours to lie in bed and not do anything right now makes me a very very happy human being 😇
Sunday could not come soon enough 😩 #shoppingspree
Can't wait for home made burgers and onion rings tonight 😍🍔 #sohungry #sogood @JonKapac17
Talents include: crying in the dark in my room eating three pieces of toast on a Sunday night

Some lady tipped me $1.25 because "she was in my place before, and that we should be tipped like servers at restaurants" ❤️🍕 #luhher
Just climbed up 30 flights of stairs 😩
Nothing like a little 8:30am House of Cards 🇺🇸💻
We're being so #PRODUCTIVE @matt16storm
However running the mile back will be so easy 😂
Why did I think it was a good idea to run a mile into the wind 😵🌀
Prof: "this example is going to take an hour" #what
All I can think about is my BBQ chicken pizza I'll be making myself tonight 😍
Hate when I fall asleep with my retainer in my mouth but wake up with it completely gone 😠 #whereareyou
Just was productive for 13 hours straight 😭 thank god for my bed and Netflix to end off this day 🙏
Pretty sad how happy I am that I have a full week between now and my next midterm... It seems like such a long break... 😱
People literally just took the elevator up to the gym because they were "too lazy"... #omg
Spotted: a beagle guard dog http://t.co/cqTUrXuldc
