Racist groups are organising themselves in political parties focused on immigration, successfully across Europe. Scary. #ExtremeRussia
So much respect for @REGYATES facing such horrifying racism. Incredibly brave to cover it. #ExtremeRussia
Good to meet with Flemish youth reps in Brussels. We're having a few beers before heading back to the UK! http://t.co/q9Et24Oy3K
The truth is we have seen too many issues with violence against women in Glasgow, it's unacceptable, and we need action.
Incredibly sad. My thoughts are with Karen Buckley's loved ones. We need to talk about safety for women in this city. http://t.co/CR1kPH7Y3U
BBC News - Students warn tuition fees pledge MPs of 'payback time' http://t.co/Oqq25ZESpN
If you don't cover a Parliament and it's work, people don't know it out understand it, let alone the good it does. Problematic.
Interesting difference of media coverage. Watching France 24. Two of the top 4 stories are about the EU. Our media doesn't cover it at all.
Many thanks to the wonderful @hudghtonmepSNP for taking time out to meet the Young Ambassadors today! Great work ahead!
Was really good to meet @IanDuncanMEP to talk about youth rights and political participation today in Brussels. http://t.co/JburxuDtj8

Housing Associations are the laat bastion of affordable public housing. They shouldn't have government forcing them to reduce their housing.
There are more homeless homes in Britain than homeless people. So many in council estates too because of right to buy.
Up early for my Brussels visit! I'll be with @UKYA_live at the European @Youth_Forum, and meeting @IanDuncanMEP &amp; @hudghtonmepSNP tomorrow!
Preparing for my trip to Brussels tomorrow while watching @RickSteves and then he favourites my tweet to him! Well timed! #KeepOnTravelling!

That plan may also follow through with her running mate. A figure from a state where she isn't as popular. #Clinton2016
Looking forward to seeing what happens on Sunday! Smart move launching in weak spot Iowa. Not playing up to her base. #Clinton2016
Fracking is not the answer to our energy needs. Ask your MP candidates to sign the #frackfreepromise: http://t.co/9ehKey2RKr
Shocked and appalled that @UniArtsLondon are suing students and elected officers standing against cuts! We will stand with #OccupyUAL!

Murphy is a guy who one day says Labour won't need to offer SNP anything as Sturgeon won't back the Tories, to saying she is the next day.
Nice sessionable festival in Larbert, good couple of beers. First time here, seems like a nice place!
Well said Jim Sillars, anyone can be accused of something someone said they heard was said about them. #GE2015 http://t.co/dKWkfQJtjO
Oh dear, George Galloway has fallen out with a brewery over a joke tweet. Remember when he tried to sue our national union for students? lol
Nice afternoon up in Larbert for the Real Ale Festival! @CAMRA_Official building me up for Paisley, Leuven, and GBBF! http://t.co/fT6brnZhZt
... And with my work done for the day, time to head over to Larbert for the Real Ale Festival! My first time at the home of Tryst!
Proud of this city today. We stood against the status quo of bombs over our welfare. We will not be ignored, we will #ScrapTrident!
A right-wing paper made an unevidenced claim about Sturgeon, and Labour are all over it despite it being debunked. Politics can be nasty.
Amazing turnout for the #BairnsNotBombs #ScrapTrident demo! http://t.co/tiGnYAezPG
Good evening enjoying some excellent real ales up in Glasgow's West End. Shout out to the @Curlers_Rest &amp; Three Judges for great reception.

Shocking that @WeAreSTV are not including the Scottish Greens! Why not?
The positive response to SNP, Greens, and Plaid in England is interesting. It's showing we are on the path to something new. #leadersdebate
We were told these debates would fail. I seen a debate that included all parts of the UK and more than austerity-parties. #leadersdebate
Absolutely clear that the anti-austerity politics won that, great for our democracy that it wasn't a fight between the boys. #leadersdebate
I believe in legislating to end Zero Hours Contracts, it is good but should end them completely; proposals must go further. #leadersdebate
"Our real friends in the Commonwealth", Europeans are our friends and they share our local environment &amp; future with us. #leadersdebate
Genuinely have to keep reminding myself that Leanne Wood is not the First Minister of Wales. She should be. What a fighter! #leadersdebate
When schools compete, those schools at the bottom (like mines) are disadvantaged. Far too few flourish beyond it. #leadersdebate
Nicola Sturgeon says she would not be First Minister of Scotland if it weren't for free education. Inspirational. #leadersdebate
Nick Clegg on fees. Everyone in laughing in Strathclyde Student Union! Hahha #UWotM8 #leadersdebate
Cameron says anyone who wants to go to uni can. Not if you are a mature student wanting to do a postgrad. Incredibly unfair. #leadersdebate
Interesting polling on the debate. Nicola Sturgeon could become British Prime Minister! The women are winning this debate! #leadersdebate
"A discussion about the kitchen table around the kitchen table!" #leadersdebate
No part of the UK should be forced out of our EU. We signed up to a UK that is to become 'near-federalism'; lets see it. #leadersdebate
Farage made his career in banking, he supports deregulation to obscene levels. Immigration isn't the problem, deregulation is #leadersdebate
Abolition of post-study work visa is hurting unis, I've seen this on paper. It's so we can say we are tackling immigration. #leadersdebate
Fair play that was oretty good. #KickMeOut #leadersdebate
Proud to hear cheers for #FreeMovement at Strathclyde Student Union. The next generation want an open Europe without barriers #leadersdebate
We should never look up to Austraila on immigration. Anti-immigration is on the rise and it hurts us all. #leadersdebate
EU citizens are net-contributors and those who don't work are mostly students who are growing our economy. @neweuropeans #leadersdebate
I believe in Europe, I believe in an open society. Immigration grows our economy, not destroys it. Join @NewEuropeans! #leadersdebate
Next up immigration. Lets see the unreasonable, misguided, and xenophobic immigration politics of the UK unfiltered. #leadersdebate
Students stand for society, we stand against austerity attacking it &amp; racism that divides us. We need an economy for us all! #leadersdebate
Massive cheers at Strathclyde Student Union when Sturgeon says there is nothing Farrage won't blame on foreigners. #leadersdebate
Amazing that Cameron admits he fired 20,000 people in our NHS. But it's cool, apparently they are bureaucrats. #OhDear... #leadersdebate
We're fixing the economy with UKIP parking tickets. Amazing. Aaaamaaazzing. #leadersdebate
More cuts are promised by the three big parties. #WeLoveABrokenEconomy #CutsCutsCutsCuts
£12bn of cuts are coming from welfare?! When the economy is destroyed. What a nonsense! #leadersdebate
Austerity-lite or Austerity-heavy. Westminster, I'm not excited. #change! #leadersdebate
Hahaha UKIP Scotland doesn't exist. #MoneyGoingOverHadriansWall #CannyScots... #leadersdebate
Labour does govern a lot of the UK, as do the tories. It's unfair to say progressives shouldn't challenge them. #democracy #leadersdebate
If Cameron abolishes Trident I'm sure he'll met his goals! #leadersdebate
.@neweuropeans #EUcitizens pay more in taxes than they take in benefits #leadersdebate"
#EUcitizens are under attack in this election because we are fussing over immigration instead of fixing our broken economy. #leadersdebate
The progressives on this debate are owning it! We see a choice between austerity and people's economy that works for us all! #leadersdebate

Stunning interview from Ian Duncan Smith on #Marr. The Tories are refusing to tell us how much austerity is coming. That's just wrong.
