Can't believe how many pie eaters were actually surprised by the announcement
I suppose it makes a change from the current sky /flower wankfest
All cue the sky/tomkins wankfest
http://t.co/OiCL0lbSih weird how I played this track on sat night for first time in ages then Mr Smiths burns down #weird
May have a fiver on Chicago rock building to be next
Poor Mr Smiths. That's the last of my youth memories destroyed. Gone the same way as the showboat and will end up as flats like the world
And that young man is why you ain't getting Â£180k a week
Lee Mason is a disgrace to football. Every week he is absolute dog shit. Could not ref Sunday League.
Mason did not give the pen because he messed up the foul on Coutinho seconds earlier.This is not the right decision but that is what he does
I may send my cv to @NUFC. If they let Carver have a go at manager then surely my managing 5 a side in the Padgate league gives me a chance
A united win would be a great result for Liverpool today. Oh well we can always wait for city to slip up next week. ABU
My view for this evening. Gigging at Gullivers World tonight @BirchysDisco http://t.co/xAbLhSNl3C
Gonna be a great weekend on twitter of Golf loving Horse Racing experts all spouting shite.
Big cocky spider in the kitchen just got run down by jacks Spider-Man bike. Oh the irony
Imagine the Pie meltdown if Wires sign Sam Tomkins. Samaritans will be busier than when Robbie Williams left Take That in the 90's
Labour using joey Essex to win votes. It's deffo time to win the lottery and piss off to Spain. This country going to the dogs big time
Got into the studio this morning and they were replaying last night's match. Result was still bad but me &amp; @adrian_jackson1 sounded good
My co-presenter on @RadioGeneralWHR this morning http://t.co/rKTJb5Nn8O
My fav boy in the whole world. Can't believe he is 3 on Tuesday http://t.co/xbNhbHJuiV
Warringtons best players tonight http://t.co/w46ancWM7F
Sat chilling in the press room pre match ear wigging to the stories of Ray French. Can't wait for the match. Gonna be a cracker
Classic @Wolfie__1 #DerbyDay http://t.co/oZELfHT5OJ
Looking forward to commentating on the big SL game of the weekend tomorrow night with @adrian_jackson1 Doesn't get bigger than that one
Penaltyapool
So with Sam ready to return home, will he return to a top 4 side or be happy moving back to Wigan
That's it for all the politics. Important things happening today. Wires vs Hudds and England footy. Woy out
Tory or labour. It's not really improved has it? Same squabbling like 2 year olds and poor still poor and rich still rich #BattleforNo10
I don't care how well they argue on telly. How does this make them the right person to run this country? It's all bollocks #BattleforNo10
Am I the only one who thinks that all the candidates are a bit shit. #BattleforNo10
150 people died in a plane crash and a young RL player fighting for his life yet people care more about Clarkson or 1 fifth of a boy band
Just read on twitter someone call someone else a "Wankbasket". What a great swear word, I like it nearly as much as "Wankstain" or "Bellend"
How irritating is the presenter on milkshake. Wouldn't mind she is bang tidy as well but she does my box in
Saints taxis? In Warrington. Someone is taking the piss posting this through the door http://t.co/OAheL996nE
I'll let you shag my wife #ohmickeyhigham
Been listening to @talkSPORTDrive for a few weeks and I really enjoy the debate but I certainly wont be listening to that phone hacking arse
Great comment from the wife today. "If Messi played so well, why does he keep missing?"
How has Pele qualified for a ticket for the United game? #LFC
Just wondered what @GabbyLogan take on this vine is. 2 different views from the BBC https://t.co/e6XOyULkpG Why are they different?
I have no interest in Paddy's Day. I am English so you stick your silly hats &amp; Guinness up your feckin arses. POTATO
Was a pleasure to commentate on a great @wolvesrl performance last night for @RadioGeneralWHR
Back on commentary duties on @RadioGeneralWHR from 3pm today for Wolves vs Hull KR. Lets hope the Wire get back to winning ways
Made Up for Villa. Just for the fact that Adrian Chiles will be having a shite Saturday night
I still remember when we used to invade the Wilderspool pitch after every game win or lose just to get autographs and sock ties
After all that skill and entertainment &amp; then the ref ruins it in the last minute. So frustrating #SuperLeague
I'd love it if @Chris_Riley2 scores the winner now
#WaneIn
Speechless at that United goal. Tim Krul you absolute bellend
Had the touch of the Gerrard goal against olympiacos #LFC
At least his beloved Arsenal won #HarryKane
As much as that piece of play from Rangi Chase was out of this world. Once every few weeks ain't gonna improve Salford is it?Not consistent
What's with all this flapping at tackles wires? Awful after a great great to 2nd half
Miles better from Wires. Clever play from Wheeler too. The wheelers are back on
2 silly pens already in 2 mins. Wire are beating themselves
Still not getting putting a winger at full back and a full back on the wing. Ok kev played well last week but put players in strongest area
The Wheelers have well and truly fell off this week #wires
Wires looking like Brazil and playing like them to. Brazil are crap at RL
Wheeler having a mare today
Like a moonlight shadow #80stweet
Clark still wearing his Cas undies
Quality oggie by West Ham. Danny Baker will be using that for an xmas dvd
You can even see Anfield although Goodison was hiding http://t.co/a894EajumZ
It is certainly a great view from the top of the Radio City Tower http://t.co/iWQUOwUiO5
It was nice to see how @CityTalk1059 works this morning. Shame I never got to see my favourite blue @daviddownie17 though
Really pleased with my interview about Istanbul this morning. Thanks @MadeinKendal for making it possible.
Ben Failure again, he should be reffing kids this week not having a trip to France
Thanks @itv for muting Kanye. Should have done it when his silly bint was on stage as well.
Seeing the legend Peter Beardsley holding a widnes shirt makes me as sad as when I found out Rachel Riley supported Man Utd #badtimes
only a few days until I see the real best British band and best British male. Mr Noel Gallagher. Beats this Brit awards cack
Sam smith George Ezra ed sheeran. They all sound like strangled cats. Not a patch on Rick Astley
Looking like the red Vee could be trophy free tonight
Matty King Matty King Matty Matty King #Wires
Has Simon Moran took Roy Asotasi to the game to try and get his money back off Russell Crowe
Well that's one team called Saints beaten today. Over to you now Bunnies
Slippy Saint tra la la la
Not our year
Fuck me. That was the most electrifying move in sports entertainment. Clear red Failure
Gutted I can't go the @Wolves game tonight but Health comes first and I can't shake this lurgy.Ticket for West stand available to best offer
West stand ticket up for sale for the Warrington match tonight. Sensible offers only. Must pick up from Padgate. #WorldClubSeries
Looking forward to the docs Twitter meltdown later on
I praised Salford last week and tipped them to trouble Saints. Well how wrong was I. Awful awful awful.
Just had some idiot sales person ask me if my first name is "Birchy". #facepalm
