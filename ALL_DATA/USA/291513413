I could listen to JD and Jarmo all day long. Wish it was next season already.  @BlueJacketsNHL #CBJ

Noah calling LBJ a pussy as LBJ was walking away. What a turd. #cavs http://t.co/bzB7EqFCkO
Dang kyrie.
Ha Kunitz, what a doucher.
Sideline reporter before the game said KY didn't watch any film of Wisc... It showed if that is the case. Stupid if true.
Game, blouses.
Why Buick, why? demps trying to talk to his buds. #barking http://t.co/3QZsszU9fY

Russell is getting ridden like seabiscuit yet still no call.
Foul on Buckeyes? Shocking. Refs a bit one sided right now.
There we go #buckeyes
Only Amir #buckeyes
Come on Texas and ucla, save me.
Shots from ohio http://t.co/hLb4Ctx0pM  @JimCantore cc: @pgkimmik
I feel like I'm making a huge mistake not picking more upsets. Oh well.
gottleib can stop talking any time now.
#cbj game with #NASCAR app blasting the radio call. Go @keselowski and #cbj!
Adrian making some big saves today #COYI
I can't say anything good watching this team.
If tonight was your first knight watching Shannon Scott, you'd have to think he looks like a walk-on. Dear lord.
Stinger bombs! @aaalt @PickOfTheTwiter @goldstandard64 #cbj
BOB! #Cbj
Buckeyes look pathetic offensively
Lol Russell broke Valentines ankle. Would have been sick if he woulda cashed the 3 ball #buckeyes
#hartyparty #cbj
Happy birthday @NoLimitsHenry!! üçªüçªüçª
No Authority intervention in that Orton Beatdown of Rollins? #raw
Until Thad can get a legit big man the buckeyes won't be able to win these kind if games. Just chucking up terrible shots all game long.
Welp, let's hope for a big 2nd half from the #Buckeyes
Sam you gotta start hitting shots #Buckeyes
Big ol f'in fart noise. At lease I got a free @PapaJohnsCbus out of the deal. #cbj http://t.co/KQVbQ3gdFy
I could eat @WhiteCastle shrimp nibblers for the rest of my life. #nibblerstomyface #cravernation
#COYI #bubbles @whufc_official big match
#IAmDale
Sad to see @jameswisniewski  go. Gonna have to get a new sweater for next season. #CBJ
Amir looked somewhat athletic there. Still dropped the ball below his waist before going back up with the ball. #Buckeyes
I need three tvs #NASCAR #cavs #cbj
New shirt has arrived. Love it! @11W @EzekielElliott #buckeyes http://t.co/XEUXcldESI

What the heck happened? I don't look at twitter for a few hours and almost every tweet has to do with llamas...
Damn puck won't find it's way into the net #cbj
I can't comprehend how an NBA player can be a 40% free throw shooter.
Probably not the first to say this, but Roman Reigns wins championship belt at #Wrestlemania then Seth Rollins successfully cashes in #MITB
Let's go!! Tie ball game #cbj üö®üö®üö®
Out pops bray Wyatt #WWEFastLane
Maybe? #WWEFastLane
Undertaker! #WWEFastLane
Anti-authority Randy Orton is a lot more tolerable #WWEFastLane
AC talking hockey is great. #cavs #cbj
Daaaaaaamnnnnnit kese's engine just blew up.
Free throws again. Have to make them. Bad bad bad. #Buckeyes
Buckeyes need to calm down. Turnover and bad shot machines today.
Another awful finish. #COYI
Big Sunday. West ham, Daytona 500, and wwe fast lane. Lot of couch miles today.
Gooooooaaaallllll ! #coyi kouyate
