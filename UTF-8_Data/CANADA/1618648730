excellent season, excellent draft position.
Thanks @Avalanche, @RadioMoser and the altitude folks for the excellent year.
Buddy in a Stastny jersey gets a Cliche jersey
Poor Duncan Siemens, having to give his first NHL game jersey away for "jerseys off out back" night
HISHON AGAIN
Not one bit. Deep draft first few rounds even too
Avs with a top 12 pick isn't bad in this draft at all.
my gut told me to pick Hishon for #avstwitterpsychic tho...
Duchene would FINALLY have a full season and be snake bitten all fucking year #avs
also Jim Nil please send matty an invite to worlds and Iggy and Barrie probably ROR too
sad no Dutchy-Nate bromance #avs
16 is a weird number for Siemens
Sidney Crosby Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin could all  be on the world championship roster
"@theroyalhalf: #IsItOctoberYet" #BuyACalendar
Everybody picking Siemens for #avstwitterpsychic.... I really want to but, I'll end my #AvsTwitterPsychic the way I started it... #9 Matty D
