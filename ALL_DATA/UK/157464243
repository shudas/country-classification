Twitter gets way too dirty at this time of night, this was not part of the deal 🙅
And I'm struggling now never mind when it comes to driving back to Dundee
The fact that I've still got 6 hours of my shift left makes me want to greet
I'm such a psycho bitch
I need to learn to not be so fucking needy 😠
I moan when I constantly have something to do and never get to chill, but when I chill it's the most boring thing ever
Hamilton at NDP next Friday is exactly what I need in my life 👌🏻
Why am I not drunk
Bored, bored, bored
Dying for a zuccas but no one to go with, - the real issues of moving away for unj

Drinking an espresso before bed wasn't my finest idea
Wee couple of days with my mumma in the capital 😍
I'm so fucking done, don't think my luck can get any worse
So so sleepy, bring on 10 o'clock so I can go back to sunny strathaven 👌🏻
So sleepy 😔
You taking the piss Motherwell, we're fucked now
One of our biggest games of the season today, a win is necessary 👌🏻
Knowing absolutely everything there is to know about someone and still feeling nothing but love for them is the best feeling ever.
Should not have had that nap earlier
I can't even go a day without missing bae fuck knows how I'm going to last over summer 💔
That 5-0 win btw 😍😍
Why am I not going to Fir park tonight
When a nice cider turns into a ridiculous session, I need to learn that I can't keep up with the parents 😷
Might just treat myself to a wee pint of cider 👌😍
SAAS just saved my life
the first night in way over a week that I haven't stayed with my boyfriend and I'm hating every second of it, Defos feeling sorry for myself
So typical the one night I actually need someone absolutely no one is around
But wow these are bae 😍
The new sneaks I just bought for no reason are another good point in proving why I shouldn't handle my own money
Hate not knowing if i'm the only one in my flat or not, so awko
I should not be trusted to handle money, absolutely useless
Can 10 o'clock hurry up, I need my kip
And yes I did just say bae, oh wow
Why is it I can spend all day everyday with bae and as soon as I leave him, I miss him 😠
Coming down from a caffeine dunt makes me sad
Missing an hour makes me sad when it's between shifts 💔
Holy fuck, can't believe that's been nearly a year since prom/leaving school
Two hours left... 😔
I'm gonna die as soon as I get to bed tonight, it's a long time till 2am
such a big day tomorrow, and I've done nothing for it. I have became so lazy lately, need to get back into shape👌
Need a double espresso in my life pronto
I actually hate orange doing nothing but robbing me
I am supposed to be getting my life together, another essay not gonna be in on time, I fail at uni, literally
Hate being the first one awake when you're staying at someone's, so bored 💔
That I also haven't been to one lecture for
I couldn't think of anything less motivating than a Classical Antiquity essay
Need to get back to Dundee so I can start my essay, this makes me sad 😭
Actually fuck Tequila
Home for the weekend tomorrow buzzzzzin😍
Fitness test and SET passed👌 scary times to come
Aw no chance can I be this smitten
My half 5 alarm is whitey material
Going from a nice comfy double bed back to mines is devastating
Getting to that stage where I couldn't give a fuck what anyone else thinks and it's amazing👌😍
We may not have won, but I got to see McDonald score again, and have a quality wee road trip with ma gal👌 dece wee night

Not been to the soccer in forever.
Don't know if I should go home or go to Aberdeen away on Friday night hmmmm
One week till my police fitness test and I the most exercise I've done in 4 months is walking around work 👌
No idea how I'm going to survive a 9 hour shift tonight
I think I'm dying, too much caffeine
I have such a love - hate relationship with uni, love it when I'm there but can't find the motivation to get there
I've never met a group of people so in denial like Rangers fans are, get the fuck over it
Love dropping my red bull in my spaghetti and toast 😷
Throat is killing me
I hate cheap booze
I'm a pie
Actually going to the dancing on a Saturday I feel like a teenager again👌
And skippy is backkk #OneScottMcDonald
Watching Kirsten play cod stresses me the fuck out
It's quarter past four on my day off and my tough decision is wither to drink beer or energy juice
I don't get how it's possible to text someone all day every day and never run out of things to say
I swear the bad things always happen to the good people.
Going to uni in my tesco uniform this is embarrassing
I can't wait to go back to bed
I always feel awake till I sit down in a lecture hall 😴
Relegation battle got seriously interesting this weekend too 👌
So good seeing Scott McDonald back in a motherwell shirt 😍😍😍
Never been so headfucked in my life
Love feeling like an absolute mug, karma is a bitch👌
Okay I'm a wee bit in love with Ezra from Pretty Little Liars 😍😍😍
The way I'm feeling now is definitely karma for being such a cunt in the past
Absolutely scadded myself on the sunbed the day 😭
I haven't been this skint since before I started working in tesco, it's far too long till SAAS comes through
Bruno Mars makes me happy
Barca though 😍
Eventually got my iPhone back

My car is that dirty that I thought the number plate had fallen off last night

My besto is the worst influence ever
I'm gonna have to take out a second loan just to do my fucking washing in these halls, so fucking dear
All I want to do is chill drink beer and watch soccer, is that too much to ask jeez
home made soup is life
could be doing with getting drunk any time soon
Never realised so many people are in fucking relationships jeeezo
Can tell I've had too much sleep today, way too awake👻
Long distance actually sucks so much, not had a spoon since nineteen canteen
Think I'd actually hit someone if they bought me these boots 😷 http://t.co/zylK9JzAnL
