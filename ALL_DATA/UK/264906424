I feel people invent their own obstacles to prevent them from doing something just because they're too scared to fail.
Honestly no one could tell me not to be with someone. Not one person.
Whether it's race, peer pressure &amp; hearsay, ex's, friends ~ whatever
I really very much hate the mindset of not being with who you love cause of what somebody else thinks.
