When we say 
"bring your wife's pie", it means we expect him &amp; her to both show up to a event! No 'Sexism' involved!!

I normally don't RT the @AlbertaParty but, even they know this #BYWP thing is massively overblown!

Leftists &amp; Urbanites freaking out over an ad for a pie sale. Really?! We talk like this in rural AB all the time! Men &amp; Women both!!

Urbanites don't understand the culture in rural AB. Men &amp; women talk this way all the time!

Leftists playing up this #BYWP thing, really need to fill thier time with something else. They're offended just to be offended. #abvote

The @OntLiberal Party are getting desparate to salvage their 'sexification' plan for 8 year olds.

The budget introduced by Premier Prentice will make AB a Liberal tax-&amp;-spend prov. Only @TeamWildrose has a realistic plan.

Popcorn Jellybeans. In which corner or Mordor did they spawn?! x-p
It seems that conservative voters are moving toward @TeamWildrose and, leftist voters are moving to @AlbertaNDP.
#abvote #pcaa #wrp #abndp
So far in #abvote, there is a real possibility of #pcaa losing power. Only, it's hard to say who will take over. Interesting times.
