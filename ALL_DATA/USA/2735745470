Getting even one day out of the weekend off is a god send.
Volleyball sometime this week while it's nice with alex?! @mooremic007
I've been sitting outside all day... just sitting here. Listening to the sweet sweet sounds of summer arriving.
Guilty. http://t.co/sPazi8h81U
Just waited until 2pm to eat because that's when @tacobell 's happy hour starts.
I miss @TheJoshElliott1 so much. He's like my alter ego in a way.. hahaha
I'm so tired but ill probably be awake until 3am for no reason.
Morning shifts go by so quickly to me but afternoon shifts seem to drag on forever.

This weather outside rn is disrespectful as fuck.
I just got told "I'm thicker than a can of peanut butter" lmaoo

I love that I get a ten minute break every two hours.. it really helps me refocus and let's face it.. sitting down feels nice.
Applesauce, I love applesauce.
The sunset rn &gt;
I want to live by the ocean but also in the mountains but also in a big city but also in the countryside, you feel me?
"@Harvrae: @Sam_4_short I don't pretend with this mama" you n the 6 &gt;
Don't ever take advice, that's great advice.
You say you're happy but you're smoking and drinking every night.
Always remember somebunny loves you!

Should I get a thigh tattoo or the start of my left sleeve?
I hate when dudes think I just be playing hard to get. Bruh, I really don't like you, I'm not playin.

"@TheJoshElliott1: I feel like I'm going to die when I'm 27" uhh that's the age at which we have our kids and I'm not gonna be a damn widow.
If lindas a slut because she posted that picture with nic then I'm fake because I tell people I miss em when I don't...
People always tell me that they miss me wether it be a friendship or a relationship.. normally I say I miss them back but I don't..
Or the "party friemds"
Sometimes I miss partying every night but then I look at all this money I've saved and don't miss shit.
this guy goes "you're beautiful" and naturally I respond "thanks you too" LOL

You ever chill with yourself so hard you forget you need friends
Coming home to the aftermath of u trying to pick an outfit earlier &amp; having to clean clothes off ur bed when ur tired af &amp; wanna collapse &lt;&lt;

Don't Drake and drive.. you'll end up at your ex's.
I forgave you for everything. This was supposed to be a forever thing, I hate that you made it a whatever thing.
You probably don't remember half the shit I did for you.
Remember that boys heart I broke for you? I left him like you left me.
"@fromawildflower: it's all messy: the hair. the bed. the words. the heart. life..."
People make promises when the sun is shining, and make excuses when the storm comes.

S/o to myself you the only one holding it down

We can't all be princesses, someone has to clap when I walk by.
"@TheJoshElliott1: Irish you were here üçÄüçª" I know, I know lmaoo
Raves aren't ever going to be something I attend. Stop inviting me plz.
I'm a "cops, and intervention" tv show junkie...
Some people over criticize you and think they‚Äôre helping your growth. that‚Äôs weak, criticize me with real intentions, push me towards better
This is the summer you learn to let go. Don‚Äôt be defeated because you‚Äôve outgrown certain people &amp; they don‚Äôt understand that, keep walking.
I'm a good friend, I take pride in that. It took a while and some bridges had to be blown and hell had to be fought but it made me better.
Real friendships never die you can fight, get mad, be uneasy but when you find raw friends‚Äîones who are willing to travel with you, you live
Its ridiculous my mom works SO hard, she deserves the world.
My memories love you endlessly with or without your loyalty.
Idk what color lust is, but you wore it on your lips today.
I want you to turn up on me.
Omg omg omg happy birthday to the coolest cat I know. You deserve the best, and I'm so lucky to have a funny friend like you! @Haus_Noel
"@TheReal_Riley: black lives matter and cops lives dont matter" this is gold.
Sometimes, I enjoy when people stop being friends with me. It's like the garbage took itself out.
Happy birthday @Qsap_Qerg! :)
Face of an Angel, thoughts of the Devil.
You just need a few friends who can see who you are, and appreciate your uniqueness and value.
Surround yourself with people who know your worth. You don‚Äôt need too many friends in your life.
Just remember, even your worst days only have twenty-four hours...
You're so much more than what you see in the mirror. http://t.co/iT76MAqpUN
I need someone who's okay with laying in bed all day but also up for spontaneous adventures.
I say idk a lot but trust me
I be knowin
The struggle of being too emotional and being too emotionless.
I hope you learn to make it on your own, and if you love yourself you'll never be alone.
