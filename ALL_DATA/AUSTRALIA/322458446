OMG there are ocean going pigs @ProfBrianCox @ABCTV #human universe.
Woohoo it is @ProfBrianCox with human universe. I'm prepared for mind boggling facts to be scattered across my brain via glorious vistas.
I wonder if @TurnbullMalcolm pants are on fire yet. #saveABC #nobrokenpromies
Since when did Australians suddenly need a sign telling us 'danger satire ahead' #qanda
We did rubbery figures in the 80's. Pigs arse you can't do satire and current affairs. #qanda
#TeamAustralia seems to be losing players through broken promises and budget cuts. #qanda
#anda go the tassie question asker. So why do we cut it? It's unbiased and produces quality Tv which small town people can't replace.
#qanda cuts are cuts and broken promises are broken promises. It is that simple.
So let's talk about nbn &amp; ABC. We know this govt doesn't do climate change so lets  see if they can do post 1950 communications. #qanda
Inequality is a problem, that's why we need a $7 copayment. #qanda
All politics is local except for an international summit of 20 world leaders. #qanda
Australia has become a nation of queuers - we wait for others to lead the way. #qanda #ClimateAction #renewableenergy
Why do people believe the "massive debt" story? We have a AAA credit rating, the worlds banks don't think we have a problem. #qanda
Did the liberal party eat @TurnbullMalcolm brain.  I'm sure he made more sense a few years back. #qanda
I wish @TurnbullMalcolm would not hide on climate change. We need to be brave. #qanda
Thanks @4corners what a great program. Such brave people. Awesome.
Chewed up half my months internet quota watching @BarackObama talk at UQ. Inspiring. It was worth every second. What a great orator he is.
I wish @TonyAbbottMHR had followed his own rules for his speech except for the unscripted bit, please please use a script. #g20
I just watched @TonyAbbottMHR leaders retreat speech.  Aarrggghhh, aarrrggghhhh, it was so awful I have no words. #g20
Hey @TonyAbbottMHR, climate change is #onmyagenda, why isn't it on yours? #G20 http://t.co/v0n0m0vKAJ
Left half my clothes in Coonamble. ðŸ˜¢Slightly bummed by that.

I lived in Nepal during their war my presence was valued &amp; respected. Laws stopping travel to conflict areas have consequences #qanda
I'd like to get off Team Australia? It is not inclusive and does not reflect me and my values. #qanda
