Cannot stand Nigel Farage
Aaron from Emmerdale 😍😍😍
I just spelt desperately like a proper spaz
Can't find a decent denim jacket anywhere 😞
Since moving back to Rishton, I've noticed it's the exact same lollipop lady as when I was in Primary School 😊
I just wanna enjoy this sad mood :(
Browsing Spotify's mood playlists hoping for a depressing one to match my mood right now and all there are is mood boosting ones.. no thanks
They all make me go the same colour as my hair and that just isn't a good look 😂
Didn't realise how white I was until now I'm sat in the sun. Need a fake tan pronto
"@PoliticalReactz: When you are trying to fit in but its not quite working http://t.co/okkiAQOI10" @thistlewaite
Another week off college would be brill 😒
Been over a week without Spotfiy Premium.. I NEED IT BACK IN MY LIFE
I really should have finished my antibiotics 'cause I can tell this ear infection is definitely coming back 😭
"@UberFacts: For each hour of sleep lost, the odds of an adolescent being obese rise by 80 percent." @thistlewaite this must explain you.
Always wake up at ridiculous times in the morning after a night out. I should be waking up at 1pm, not 6am.
A chiffon top and leather jacket was not a good idea today
I have like a 1/10th of wine left in this bottle.. so much :) :) :) :) :)
I'm literally so bored right now
S club 7 tickets have arrived, exciting times! @thistlewaite
I don't understand why she does most of them but Miles Cyrus' edits are so fab 😂
Cannot stand Faye from Corrie.
I'm so bored I wanna go out
Love Samsung phones but they need to get their batteries sorted because this is getting beyond a joke now.
This phone battery is an absolute joke. Charged it and only started using it 40 minutes ago and it has 6% already. Cannot be dealing.
The dreaded Timehop notification has appeared
"@Year11Bants: Poor guy😂😭 http://t.co/zdTWnVIQ2a" @thistlewaite  For fuck sake, these people are haunting me
Netflix have finally added season 2 of Orphan Black, goodbye life.
Miss the days I could eat what I want and not worry about putting on weight :( http://t.co/0TsMLrU1N0
WHAT'S THE POINT OF FACEBOOK NOW
This is a sad day
I mean the fact that he added "badboii" to his name is hilarious enough
Johnny badboii lamb has just blocked me on Facebook. I feel so sad at this, he was such a laugh :( :(
Idk if my phone has changed time automatically or not, so confused
So ill and I'm going out, such a trooper
I can't cope not being able to hear out of my right ear :-( ear infections suck.
I've said 'book' too many times now. Stop.
I kinda prefer the book already. I never thought I'd ever say I prefer a book to a film!
Now that I've finally read the first book, the first 15 minutes of the film seems so fast paced compared to the beginning of the book.
Definitely staying up and watching all the Harry Potter's tonight
Little Mermaid, absolute fave☺💕
Some guy just got on the bus dressed in a Californian Police costume..... slightly confused.
If ear and chest infections could just magically go away that would be fab
I've become the kind of person that I hate the most - a breather....
Cannot stand the doctors
I'm so excited to have a relaxed weekend were I can just relax in bed all day and night :) :) fab times
"@drunk: ... Lol http://t.co/JoG8CjpFJG" @thistlewaite

Cannot cope being this ill
Can definitely tell I'm coming down with something :(
Been listening to his music recently as well, how shocking
Omg as if Lil Chris has died
The fifteen year old inside of me is crying now that Zayn is quitting One Direction. :(
Samsung batteries are so shit, I end up having to charge my phone 2/3 times a day. Most annoying thing ever!
These earphones have lasted me over 3 months, this is an achievement.
Why do people think it's alright to mess with other people's feelings :(
Was so obvious Ali was going to be found guilty. Probably the first time I've ever felt sorry for her. #PLL
Life lol http://t.co/K2djS17gci
If feelings weren't a thing that would be great :) :)
Depresses me that I could have had a job in a couple weeks if I had just answered my phone, ffs
I have so much TV to catch up on and so little time :-(
I'm over today already
Some people can be such dicks
"@eonline: Don't cry because the weekend is almost over, smile because Zac Efron's face happened: http://t.co/ycTlSw4QXL" @thistlewaite
McDonald's would be brill right now

They're making it too obvious for Andrew to be A! #PLL
Our Lips Are Sealed 'The Olsen Twins' full movie (DVD): https://t.co/NCL9k11Erf fave Mary Kate &amp; Ashley Olsen movie for sure
Didn't realise how good looking Rick is from The Walking Dead until he's shaved his face
Surprised I haven't died from standing on this bus
1 minute and 28 seconds in to The Fox and The Hound 2 and I give up. Looks crap compared to the first one, minus the rubbish ending.
Why do people think it is acceptable to open windows on the bus when it is cold outside??? Absolutely freezing
Sporting the Phil Mitchell look today
Am I really reading tweets about "how good" Rickys song from towie is? Seriously???? It's shit!!!!!
Changed so so so much!!!!!!!!! No eyebrows n short hair @abimel96 x http://t.co/STtOKzhZz4
Seriously? 😂😂😂😂😂 http://t.co/lzH47GPVps
Why have Givenchy made their models look absolutely ridiculous? I'm so confused right now
I just want McDonalds cheese burgers :(
I could have had a really productive day, but no
I could happily eat 5 cheese burgers from Mcdonalds right now and not regret a single thing.
I just want loads of chicken from KFC right now
Mixing Cider and Vodka wasnt the best idea 😂
I'm 100% sure that it is impossible for me to wake up on time on Fridays
That has definately got to be one of my favourite moments of Friends 😂
"Name? Well I know it's Ross but what's it short for? You know like, Rossel or Rosstopher?" 😂😂😂😂😂
"@UberFacts: A snail has about 2,500 teeth." @thistlewaite Told you!!!! One bit my brothers finger as a kid....
My sim had just been eaten by a fish and then spat out.. er whut
It worries me that in 2015 18 year olds wear foundation the same colour as my hair..

I could be snacking on Pomegranate seeds but these brownies are just too fab right now.
I refuse to feel sorry for these people on Catfish. Why get yourselves in these kind of situations?
Researching the history of tea is quite possibly more boring than maths and science put together.
No idea why I'm so tired tonight
what a saddo http://t.co/LWTGvo7hNZ http://t.co/MFOe1BL1Kj
If my bus is late because of this snow, I will not be happy
Would be a lot easier if boobs weren't a thing tho..
Feel so good this morning. Who would have thought doing exercise would make you feel so good :):):)
Can't cope with getting yelled at again for being late
I hope to God I can wake up early tomorrow
Absolutely hate KFC adverts, they do nothing but tease me.
Can't cope with Elijah from The Originals..
So happy that Bates Motel season 2 has been put on Netflix finally.
