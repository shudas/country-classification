Nicola Sturgeon loves wearing suits in the shade of a 70's bathroom suite.
TK Maxx and Sports Direct both affected by the fire in Inverness
Big fire in Academy St Inverness. Can see the flames from my house 4 odd miles away.
Great call that by Pat Bonner 😆😆😆 http://t.co/NJGfvXTfJh
How anyone in Scotland could vote UKIP would astound me! Total bellend #leadersdebate
Major all in fight at Redcliffe a Hotel on Friday for Cheltenham races. Richie Foran was in attendance......
Looking at the fixtures to split. Thistle have a very tough run. St Johnstone,Inverness,Aberdeen,Celtic
They are defiantly in the fight now
Hearing the Longman landfill is looking like it will be off. ICT need to get a ref to confirm it is unplayable.
What's the chances of the game being off tomorrow due to high winds. 50mph+ due during the game.
That is a total farce to be honest
The good news. It will be 12 degrees at ko on Sat. Slightly breezy and wet though!!! http://t.co/owRJ1x9Iwp
I wonder what % of Dundee fans have been refused entry for being pished?
They have hit the party juice hard
Madonna haha!!
10 min delay in Development team game today v Partick due to injury to County RB.Anyone know who it was J Ross or Steven Miller possibly
After today the odds to finish bottom
County 11/10
St Mirren 2/1
Motherwell 5/2
Really? Looks well out to me.
Big big 20 mins coming up now.
Could be off the bottom😄
I missed this signing, seems a young one for the future from Cork Cian Kingston. http://t.co/tmn0wRj1mg
ICT considering putting a steel cage in the back to take players home from Saturday nights out! http://t.co/cjRBaqD34F
Just saw the goals on Sky, all quality goals. Technique for all 3 were top drawer
Woods with the goal and our best player so far. Boydies defending against Sutton is painful to watch. Burgess on for me.
Accumulator today
Ross County
ICT
Dundee Utd

10/1 - wtf am I doing🙉
Would County fans be happy if Distan or Rio Ferdinand signed for us?They are both almost 2 years older than Meite. 34 isn't too bad(sauzee)
Flower of Scotland is a dire song.The lyrics are honking. Scotland the Brave should be our anthem.Egg chasers are the only reason it's about
Wasn't there today,but the stick Woods gets from some County fans gets on my nerves.Not saying he is our best player,but nowhere near  worst
Games like Aberdeen away won't seal our fate. Our away form has actually been decent. We just need to improve at Home and quickly.
Like the look of that County team. sernas and @kylemacleod9 on the bench👍
NEW Signing for Dons. Will be available V County
 http://t.co/fqK9NRRr5t
County interested in Joe Gormley, a striking team mate of Liam Boyce at Cliftonville previously
We have missed the OF!! Zero quality and vile songs coming from the stands.
29 yr old arrested and to appear in court for letting off 2 smoke bombs in the ICT end before KO😆😆😆
Debate about whether alcohol should be allowed in ground....Someone tell ICT that hot drinks aren't on the banned list. Toilets shocking too
Betfair has Richie Foran as 7/2 to be first scorer. Lazy bookie or surprise return?
St Mirren complaining about decisions,seek talks with SFA. Will they point out the Handball for the goal that caused a 3 point swing v us??
Feel sorry for @StrathspeyJags game at wick called of 35 mins before ko
Bet nobody's Accumulator came in today.. Bookies win.
Good day for County today in the end. good to hear that JM will try and get 2-3 in.
WTF is going on in the FA cup!!
Chelsea out to Bradford at home. Man City out to Boro at home. Spurs out at Home. Southampton out at home👌👌👌
Rosario Latouchent  is training with St Mirren with a view to sign.
I thought he was decent in Development games for us.
Brittain out for 2 months with Hamstring injury😡😡 our injuries this year are killing us!!!
2 other big announcements expected from County this week.
Don't know anymore than that.
I have missed one home game this season. Dundee🙈🙈
Kenny Maclean put in the best individual performance I have seen at VP this season. WHY don't we sign a right back, so many goals from there
The worst I have ever felt at the end of a game. Total loss of confidence running through the team. Our defence is awful.
Brutal half. St Mirren are poor but we are beyond bad. Get Boyce on and hook Cardle. Irvine wasted wise right.
IF we went down and IF Rangers went up we wouldn't have go through what Hearts fans are going through tonight. #silverlining
Chris Porter- Think we have made an approach for him.
Tidser is supposedly being chased by Morton, St Mirren &amp; County.
Morton fans desperate for him to sign.
LOAN SIGNING: @CamBurgess95 has joined the Club on loan from Fulham FC until the end of the season.”&gt; tweeted about this 6 days ago👌
Spoke with an economists today who said if a Yes vote went through, financial panic would occur due to SNP's min oil price in referendum.
Charlie Nicholas being called a racist for saying Fernando and Fernandinho look similar. They do!!! World has gone crazy!!
Disappointing that Dingwall has no power again, winds in Dingwall have been a fair bit below Inverness over the last 2 nights and In'ess ok.
I thought Tidser was excellent and a real improvement on Woods and especially Dunfield.
As much George Adams was disliked by many whilst at County I fear we are suffering from losing his contacts in the game. Potential targets😭😭
3 games in a row, massive games 6 points is possible if we can get a couple of players in this week.
Right back - just thinking who we could get - Darnell Fisher for Celtic wouldn't be bad on loan.
Craig Curran, hmmm underwhelmed!!

JM says he hopes to sign a couple, if that is the case 11th is the best we can hope for.
Is Kiss due a suspension? 5 or 6 yellows now
The only good thing is it highlights we need 4 or so new players to survive. Arquin wants to leave it is clear.
We were lucky to get away with 1-3 there. No outfield player anywhere near pass marks. ICT midfield completely bossed that game. Tansey Motm
Refs can't wear black against the County strip...How can a keeper? Major clash IMO
Some game this Dundee Derby.
3-1 after 30 mins
Pitch inspection at Firhill for the late game. Very doubtful
RAF sea king circling above Inverness. Looking for someone missing from last night probably.
RVB beats that knob Lewis = good times
Seats available on the Inverness supporters trust buses from Inverness on n'er day. Will I chance it???
Songo'o has played 1 league cup game for Blackburn this season. It would be great to get him back. £££ stopped him coming in August
Tremarco with the assist there!!

What the hell was he doing?
2-0 Hibs, ripping them a new one
Yesssss Hibs, what a goal!!!
Good of the met office to warn us of yellow snow. Learned that from a young age though😉 http://t.co/5l1kCS7C0l
P&amp;J reporting is always spot on, at least they got one name right. http://t.co/EY0MU5y4Iw
Dingwall not playing great.
Can see Carey on after 15 mins of 2nd half.
Poor game so far
Aberdeen v County game now moved to a Saturday 3pm ko👍 http://t.co/UAmf2toQKr
#SPOTY2014 Mcilroy has a great year, but should someone who will play for Ireland rather than GB&amp;I in the Olympics in 2016 win???
What way was the team setup today? Two up top?
Tony Dingwall baby Tony Dingwall oooooo
Get in there!!!!!
We are so due a break!! All over Motherwell. Come on!!
Dundee Utd will be raging after being told to pay 170k to Rangers for Telfer. Can't wait for Thomson's statement he hates Rangers
Celtic style 1 legged glasses 😄 http://t.co/g7ziwLelXb
County decent until final ball. Quinn unlucky with goal. Woods,Reckord,Irvine&amp;Dingwall doing well. Ross&amp;Cardle struggling
Right, who the hell is Left mid? Steven Ross?
Toshney CB with Quinn.
Bet nobody picked that line up!!
Actually laughed out loud at his Spanish. Watch out Steve McLaren  https://t.co/1hkqMtIJy9
ICT are flying joint top of the league, so 1,250 home fans turn up for a Cup replay. Shocking support.
Croft offered 2 match suspension for tackle on liam Boyce by SFA.
What about John Beatson?? Surely Ditched for a while!!
WTF Jimmy Bullard was a winner all the way. 
Something dodgy there!!!
County play Celtic late Dec &amp; late Jan.Celtic have 4 games inbetween. Jan game is the game before they play http://t.co/P9ApTbGRZC players🙏
Foggy(Zelda from Terrahawks) is raging he lost the challenge. 
#imACelb http://t.co/GJxrKou7x0
Pat Nevin is a twat, awful review of the game. Coyle and @BBCjsutherland with correct view.
It is usually a sign of desperation when a team blame the ref, but Beaton messed up 1st goal offside, handball for pen. Croft tackle=red
I make it County have 1 of the last 10 cup games played! (Stranraer this season)
http://t.co/Kxdg9DcgyU&gt; this will probably affect Amateur football next season, hopefully it is not abused
Doesn't feel right Scottish Cup for big boys starting in November!
Tim Dreesen is training with @fcoss_09 who are in the 2nd tier of Dutch football.
A9 speed camera's- I have not heard of anyone getting done by them.
Are they on?
And the English take the mick out of Scottish keepers! Forster shocker last night. Hart's position laughable tonight, on the wrong side!!
Sports personality contenders Hamilton,McIlroy,Bale, Froch + people I have never heard of!!!! Poor year
Oh dear&gt;&gt;&gt;“@NairnCounty_FC: Please refrain from posting comments about our manager on here these will be removed. #notacceptedonhere”
Brian Maclean in talks with St Mirren😆😆😆
Game is screaming out for James Morrison to get on. He has excellent link up play and will stay close to Wiltshire.
Robertson did lose AOC😡
Development squad lose 3-1 away to Dunfermline. Dunfield with the goal from a free kick
