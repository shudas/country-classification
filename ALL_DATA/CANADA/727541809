Going to #Tipperary's pub on16th Ave in Calgary in an hour or so. Anyone want to join me?
Twitter's been around since 07; the Oilers haven't made the playoffs since 06. Thus...Oilers playoff hockey predates Twitter.

Happy Birthday @SpencerD14 !!
Have you ever read someone's auto correct and wonder what kind of conversations they've had in the past?

Just finished reading #AfterlifeWithArchie.
Now I know why I don't watch #WalkingDead. 
I'm so depressed right now. :-(
It starts....

Dear Depression,
Stop fucking with me and my friends. I fucking hate you and wish you an excruciating death. 
Sincerely, 
@RandomlyCory
Thanks to @zwvck I have a new favorite pickup line:
"Wanna come to my place? My couch doesn't pull out; but I do!"
Hahaha. ðŸ˜‚

Nothing like the holidays to remind me why the fuck I moved hundreds of kilometers away.

Here's hoping I can go to work today. Meh, who am I kidding? Of course I will be there.
Only so often you can chase the end of the rainbow before you realize there's no such thing. Back to reality, ladies and gentlemen.

I love Amazon &amp; Netflix. But I still love walking in a store. The future's not as exciting as I had hoped.

#AmericanHorrorStory drinking game - take a shot whenever #EvanPeters cries. 
He's not talentless but easily the most annoying every time.
Hey #EmmaRoberts, can you play your exact same character from #Scream4 in #AmericanHorrorStoryCoven? Thanks. 
#NoRange
Great game @DMcDonald39 tonight. Shots weren't indicative of scoring chances but a shutout is a shutout. Amazing saves in the 3rd for both.
Betcha the Bandits regret not putting in this goalie earlier. 
#KodiaksVsBanditsGame
Passing still blows but fairly end-to-end 3rd period. Decent save by new Bandits goalie (they too realized Fredrick sucked). 4-0 Camrose.
So far intermission has been the most exciting, since the Zamboni's the only thing that glides on the ice w/o falling.
#KodiaksVsBanditsGame
It's a sad when your goalie (@DMcDonald39) has the most accurate pass on the team &amp; his team still can't handle them.
#KodiaksVsBanditsGame
At least @DMcDonald39 seems to know what he's doing. Nobody else does. 
#KodiaksVsBanditsGame
These refs make NHL refs seem like they know what they are doing. 
#TerribleReffing
#KodiaksVsBanditsGame
I get the shot counter guys are like 100 yrs old, but Camrose has 12 shots &amp; then scores, ideally that's still a shot.Nope. Still 12.
Choppy passing. Choppy game. Good score. (Not sure what it says about their goalie). 3-0 Camrose. 
#KodiaksVsBanditsGame
You may think you're awesome, but you'll never be "Bane arm-wrestling Venom" awesome. Sorry. http://t.co/STsgrjawDm
Sad thing about almost being done #AmericanHorrorStoryCoven is that there are no more seasons left on Netflix. #IhaveNOpatience

#AmericanHorrorStory or #Gotham?
It's official. Sleep may not happen tonight.
Is it bad that #AmericanHorrorStory is comfort in a night of depression?
