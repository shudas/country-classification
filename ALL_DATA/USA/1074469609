I can't wait for Malik Monk to come to Arkansas. Just so MA can misuse him for the one season he's here.
My new favorite thing about twitter. Those folks that make a tweet at you and then delete it seconds later. #SayWhatYouWant Don't be scared.
38 &amp; DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
White or black this is what a crackhead looks like! @JustinAcri7 http://t.co/oDbej50jXj
Damnit! It's a really really long time until football season! Ugh...
Mike Anderson's look says it all! @JustinAcri7 @jimharris360 @PatBradley22 http://t.co/3okoRnS7TO
So far Kentucky is actually being forced to play 5 on 5 basketball without the help of the guys in stripes.
We can't beat Kentucky and the refs.
Bonny Portis is trying way too hard. Borderline desperation basketball.
Could someone explain to me why Jacorey Williams is still on scholarship? @jimharris360 @JustinAcri7 @PatBradley22
Hogs getting some very favorable calls so far.
Arkansas must get @So_Splash would be a huge addition to this nasty defense Coach Smith is building! He's a piece to build around!
Guess I've upset some delusional Hog fans today. Oh well.
On the bright side there was a great team in Bud Walton today! http://t.co/PU6AuKHn0x
Arkansas fans amaze me sometimes. If you point out obvious flaws your suddenly a negative person who's not a fan.
How many wide open 3's can this team allow? What a pathetic display of defense on your home floor.
That moment after you've had a stomach bug for a couple days and you can actually fart... Yes that's a glorious moment!
Folks that's a serious pile of sleet! @KATV_Weather Benton. http://t.co/feBfe8pPey
Grown men! Tweeting about the bachelor! What the hell is wrong with this world?
The outcome of this game won't be indicative of the talent of Arkansas as much as it will be the talent of Kentucky.
Can we make it 4 in a row? Go Hogs! #BeatKentucky http://t.co/kvgbz9o2h4
