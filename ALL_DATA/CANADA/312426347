#IDARB Squishy can't win this
Daredevil episode 3,  Nice to see the Kingpin and Damn that assasin is crazy. This was a dark episode.
Daredevil episode 2,  also not bad. The fight scene in the doorway was cool and I liked the eel alcohol.
Daredevil episode one,  Pretty good. I like the nod to Creel in the gym the most plus the references to "The Incident". #Marvel #Avengers
