Time to rest.
I'm lightweight a hypocrite for retweeting that because I use to do that, but I haven't done it in over a year so that isn't me anymore.
I'll get six hours if I'm asleep in 10 minutes.
When celebrities do Q&amp;A's they only answer questions that they want to answer, not the questions that people actually want answers to.
so much ugly.
I am still awake because I have to do my laundry.
I either pass out early or stay up hella late.
disgusting
Unfriended is a scary movie that I actually want to see.
well it's officially baseball season for me now, my basketball team's season is over.
season is over 😕😕😕
I love Nik and Ben, but unless one of them is willing to take a backseat to the other, one of them will have to be traded next season.
I can't get too excited about how the Kings are playing because they're playing the Lakers and because it's the last game of the season. 😢
Even though they're playing the Lakers.. how the Kings are playing right now is a representation of how good of a coach @CoachKarl22 is.
Derrick Williams will make a team happy next season, but that team will not be the Kings.
The NBA should take from the MLB when it comes to tiebreaking situations for the playoffs.
I know whoever plays the Warriors in the first round though, will get destroyed in four, at the most five.
But if the Pelicans make the playoffs I won't be mad, I'll actually be rooting for them because of @ryananderson33.
I want to see the Thunder make the playoffs, just because I want to see Russell Westbrook continue to go stupid in the playoffs.
I hate accidentally following someone.
Of course the day that I don't bring my charger to school, my phone is gonna die at lunch time.
sleepy
A's have sole possession of first place with a 4-4 record in the AL West. 🆗🆒👍🏻
I'm almost broke af again.
No car for probably the rest of the week. 😪😪
There's a reason why the Warriors didn't trade Klay Thompson.

Andre Miller is so smart, he knows when to give it up, and when to take it himself.
I've learned more in traffic school today then I did in the two weekends at Drivers Ed.

I almost never request to follow someone on Instagram first.
