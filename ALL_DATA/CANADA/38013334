HeLa: an everlasting prison for HPV18.
Then again, a lot of labs that are working with HPV are working with non-infectious forms, such as the immortal HeLa cells.
But let's be honest, receiving a common sexual transmitted infection while not even having sex is not exactly something to brag about.
According to the PHAC's pathogen safety data sheet for human papillomavirus, there have been no lab acquired infections... to date
Meanwhile in the lab, cancer cells with their virus-speckled genomes take little rest. Those guys just keep going!
