Michael Clarke how dare you captain Melbourne? I am absolutely disgusted! #whydoyouleavesydney
My assignment is due tomorrow at 4pm and I haven't started it yet... When is that sense of urgency going to kick in? #halp
Love coming to uni for multiple presentations that have nothing to do with my research paper at the end of sem. 👍 #justmediastudentthings

Only has about five hours of sleep and my body thinks it's okay to force me to wake up because someone started their car...
Congratulations to @ChiefsESC for qualifying to represent Oceania in Turkey! You guys played a great series, you deserve every moment 🎉
These viewer numbers are incredible! Really great for a growing scene to get this kind of viewership and support for our finals. #IAMOPL
Running low on data but can't help to check Twitter and even a sneaky peek at Twitch for the #IAMOPL finals. 🙊
Heads on straight boys! Give us a good series! #IAMOPL
The Riot office have outdone themselves with the studio for OPL, it looks amazing! Now I want a nice clean game, from all of you! #IAMOPL
Gimme those skins @LOL_Oceania! I predict 45 kills for @DireWolvesGG tonight in the #IAMOPL finals! #DWWIN
At least with the new OCE team icons, I'll still be able to tell who's who even if they name change!
To the man who is sneezing repeatedly near me, I can physically see the germs floating around you in a contaminated cloud. Please stop. ✋
Just got on a bus to be greeted by the youngest and friendliest bus driver ever. Is this what PT is like at night? O.o
AAHHHH it's Korean Post at @ChuffeRlol! Sign my mouse pad please!! 😍 @DireWolvesGG #IAMOPL
THE CHESS PIECES! #IAMOPL
The Japanese are bloody geniuses! Even their price tags are easily removable!
IT'S OVERRRR.
Apparently my parcels from Tokyo are at the Post Office so at least that's one good thing to look forward to! #betterbethere
Should've not come to class for the presentation today and then tell my teacher: whoops April Fool's. Thought you were kidding 😭😭😭
Let the pre-presentation freak-out commence!
TFW a couple share one chair in Tyree and won't stop giggling at how silly the girl is. #theonetimeitrytodowork
I'm too emotional to concentrate on any work. That LFC All Stars game was incredible and the interviews and the chants. TAKE ME BACK
They interviewed Xabi and I fell asleep because of a group project today D:
The old Reds have their own numbers back! Be still my heart! #LFCAllStars
I have three hours till the LFC Charity Match starts, the question is: Will I get any of my presentation work done? Bets? And go!
Uhhhhhwhat Faulkner MOTM? Yes he bowled spectacularly but c'mon, Clarke?
OH Michael Clarke, you beautiful captain and sportsmen. It's been a pleasure watching you! Congrats you Aussies! 🏆 #CWC15
How to do work on your group presentation when the ICC Finals are on? #sendhalp
MAXWELL YOU FIELDING BEAUTY #CWC15
Finished work for today! Time to watch some good ol' cricket!
UNSW, why do you love group presentations so much?!?!?!?  https://t.co/d3sJm5qrmw
Alright time to sleep and go to work for a 13 hour shift on 6 hours of sleep! 👍
Pretending to be a Korean while discussing Korean dramas in class, because why not?
Ed Sheeran tonight! 🎶
Thanks rain, I didn't wash my hair properly this morning before leaving the house. Thanks for saving me the trouble! ☔

I feel sick to my stomach with anxiety. We need these three points especially at home, come on boys. #YNWA
Hungers before work D: big breakfast please sustain me 🍴
Getting my iPhone6 at the end of May and it'll be 128GB.. Hello to all the jailbreak tweaks I can actually install now!
Thought I'd actually get some study done after @immunity_sarina has returned to Melbourne but what is study really?
I found the Hunter and Fox studio today. It's 3 mins away from my house. WHAT DO @AsgardLoL
"I'll wake up at 9am, no worries" she said. YET STILL CAN'T GET HER OUT OF BED @immunity_sarina

Happy St. Patrick's Day everyone! 🍀 also one game closer to top 4! ⚽ #YNWA
What do when you don't want to face responsibilities and study? BAKE BAKE BAKE :D
TIL washing your hair when you have a fresh tattoo on your shoulder cap is not a very easy task to accomplish without pain.
Thanks @AsgardLoL for dealing with the buzzing sounds, the random leg twitching and the crazy people at the S pile for BM &lt;3
Only planned to spend about $100 at Blackmilk Sample sale today but end up spending $400 on something else whoops @AsgardLoL
