Since coming from the dentist I've downed about three cups of water.
Seems like I get dehydrated every time I go to the dentist. Not sure why. I mean all that water being flung around there, I shouldn't.
Another sunny day. Right now it's 6C, but will get up to 13 this afternoon. Nice.
What an ending to the long, long weekend. Dentist appointment first thing this morning. Went well though.
Yahooo!
Calm the heart down.  OT
Oh that post.
Pretty, pretty.
That was a nice goal.
Go Canucks Go!
No no no
A very warm 13C today. Very sunny. It's been sunny for a few days now. Wonder how hot summer is gong to get.
