I promised my wife that even if I won't be around for a few months...I promise to still pay my side of the bills #GoJetsGo #NHLJets
The official #whiteout and #beersnake shirts are both untested...which will bring the most luck? #gojetsgo #nhljets http://t.co/kWDb2Fck1j
I'm more excited than the first time I had sex...got married...and welcomed my children to the world #NHLjets #gojetsgo
First #NHLjets tweet of the night...probably not the last #gojetsgo
PK Subban is trending - he must have played a solid smart game that you'd expect of a Norris winner #StanleyCupPlayoffs #HABSvsSENS
Flames!!! And bedtime!!!
Nice comeback by Chicago - at least Nashville got into overtime and take a point from the game
Under Manitoba labour laws...are you allowed 1 or 2 work naps during playoff season...and are they paid or unpaid? #NHLJets
When is the overtime in this Sens vs Habs game going to start?
Okay - think I've talked myself down after that Sens loss - I'm worried about my health tomorrow night
Honestly weird seeing they had Subban do it...but blatantly trying to get at Sens star...he deserves more punishment
I was thinking what is going to keep me busy between the Flames and Jets games? Then I remembered bed and work #NHLJets
Do the Habs and Leafs think they are the centre of the universe? They always have pregame BS that screws the late night game
People are tired of waiting for Jesus to return...so they've turned attention to watching for Mark Stone to return
KABOOM Sens - thank you Habs
Go Sens Go!!!
The rest of the country is sick of these ceremonies - DROP THE PUCK
I've never seen so much coverage of a Jets practice - #playofffever #nhljets
I guess I just can't get over Jets 1.0 - cause every time I hear #whiteout I also hear Wang Chung #nhljets
Does Winnipeg city council really have prayer as part of public meetings? I'm actually surprised and disturbed
I'm cheering for Sens, Islanders, Preds, and Flames tonight
The @AnaheimDucks are favourite but I'm feeling the @NHLJets will prevail - and I will get to stay up past bedtime to watch! #GoJetsGo
The playoffs are here!!! #nhljets #sensarmy http://t.co/SVxwBqaeLN
It's Sens Eve and Jets Eve Eve #NHLJets #SensArmy
Went for a massage...relaxed and almost sleeping and my visions kept alternating between Season 1 of The Killing and Scheifele scoring
I'm craving Chinese Food Delivery Service on Manitoba and McPhillips - and I only want their french fries
The #16 bus is full of granny panties and spandex #truestory
Well Jets, I'm still proud of how you tried your best but just came up short of the playoffs - we'll get them next year #wasteddraft
I'm not sure if the Facebook commercial with piano solo of Like a Prayer will start a revolution, but I'm certainly misty eyed
After that Tuuka Rask save, I immediately channeled the guys behind us at MTS Centre and yelled "I've got a Tuuka Rask on my balls!"
Winnipeg Jets fans...can we try to get a large circle of fans holding hands around downtown Winnipeg before we go into the next game?
Portage and Main is too obvious - I'm shutting down McPhillips and Burrows #NHLJets
SENS are in.SENS are in!! 5 Canadian teams!!! #SensArmy and #NHLJets I'm pulling for you both - until the Cup final and then I root for Jets
Mark Stone...Amazing!!!
Bold move by #NHLJets management to say if they don't win they're handing back the playoff birth
Mark Stone for rookie of year - #sensarmy
SENS!!!
Let's go Sens!!! Win and my two favourite teams will be in the playoffs #NHLJets #SensArmy
Go Jets Go!!! A win and we're in!!!! #NHLJets
Go Sens Go!!! Playoffs come down to last game of season #SensArmy http://t.co/0gsleYFfg5
