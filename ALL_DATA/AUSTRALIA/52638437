I'll be lucky to crack 300 points in my #NRLFantasy next week with all the injuries and charges coming out of the #NRLBulldogsRabbitohs game
I would do it with great difficulty, but would share with my most loved ones first #WillHill100Mil      http://t.co/YlM4yzigwM
Unfortunately all Bulldogs fans will be tarred with the same brush after this incident. There were 40k people there. We are not all the same
Very sad for the @NRL_Bulldogs for how some of the fans carried on after the game. Disgusting behaviour. I hope all are dealt with firmly.
Des best be heading to the bank real quick, let's start a fund for this one bulldogs fans!!! What a disgrace they're making out great game!
There's some refs that need to be stood down tonight. That's shit. Just handed Souths the win, cannot believe the disgrace they have made
Got a Souths supporter here saying that's horseshit! #NRLBulldogsRabbitohs

Looks like we have a nailbiter in the game that should have been televised live!!! #NRLTigersBulldogs
Gus doesn't have a nice word to say about Souths. Really disliking his one sided commentary. Last week he did the same.
