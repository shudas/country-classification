Nicola Sturgeon is the Terminator. #fact #BBCDebate
Nicola Sturgeon supports highering the minimum wage, as do the Greens and the SSP...how would independence drive down UK wages? #BBCDebate
Its turning into a rabble now, very well done to Leanne and Nicola for refraining
Shameless plug of my recent blog on why I (a left-wing so and so) am voting SNP since #bbcdebate has people thinking http://t.co/XUYNU2DMCu
Hahahahaha hilarious if true https://t.co/jbxsqCKEe8
Remember when people were genuinely scared of UKIP?! #BBCDebate
This is like watching that amateur football team who have a fat bloke in goal. Ukip being that team, Farrage being that Fat bloke #destroyed
Ed Milliband did absolutely, and hilariously, destroy Farrage there
Aww Ed you have so much potential just take one or two more steps to the left! #BBCDebate
I think Nicola Sturgeon nailed this debate early on, we really need Ed Milliband and Labour to "be bolder" #bbcdebate
Embarrassing amateur https://t.co/Wx4PZMwQJ5
Farrage - "Its astonishing" 

Sturgeon - "Yes you are"
And here comes Nicola !! Booopm Farrage's debate is over #BBCDebate
And in one statement Nigel Farrage has just surrendered this debate #bbcdebate
Nigel Farrage is literally the Chancellor from V for Vendetta.
Debate time on BBC!
Player of the year should be De Gea or Hazard but to end up being Kane
Decided that I'm going to buy an Xbox One in September
Or  like 20 packs of lube
How will I ever look at her in the eyes again, I mean do I explain or just leave it? Surely she doesn't think I would need king size
Oh my
She just asked me to come in and get them
I'm actually going to die of embarrassment
Asked my gran to clean my football bag completely forgetting there's King size condoms and lube I had in there for a laugh.... #riddy
At uni you can wear whatever you want... Here? No chance
If red or word up picked a random week night and ran a night were it was ¬£1 in and a pound drinks they'd make a killing.

Klopp set to take a break from football...year out then maybe Man Utd job?
Klopp leaving Dortmund? Shocker
1 of the blackwater guard's wives said they should be heroes. They shot innocent children in a traffic jam in Iraq. Whats heroic about that?
If i had 3 wishes then they'd be

2. Danny Alexander loses his seat.
3. Danny Alexander loses his seat.

I will not tactically vote as Ronnie Cowan is by far the best candidate for Inverclyde so it had to be SNP but I hope Ed Milliband is PM
If UKIP got anywhere near power I'd need to become V for Vendetta like
To the Labour people talking about Uni places for poor kids...if it weren't for SNP I wouldn't be at uni, not perfect but better than labour
THAT MOUSTACHE
I won't vote Labour nor do I support most of their policies but damn id rather Ed Milliband was Prime Minister than David Cameron.
Best point of tonight "there isn't anything Nigel Farage wouldn't blame on immigrants" - Nicola Sturgeon
Football Manager Game time - 403 hours, that's over 16 days meaning I've spent more than 11% of every day since its release playing it #sad

We're on the road again, Eilidh's birthday round 2 #instaspoc http://t.co/2zsJO59EVs
Tonight has been poor but by far not our worst, referee sees that handball and it's 1-1 not 2-0. Although McDowell's subs were dreadful
Aye nicely done referee, as if the penalty wasn't a stonewaller that corner definitely was.
We've actually played well tonight but McDowell taking of Vuckic was madness.
Lee Robinson got smaller as he dived there, what was that all about
Simosen and McCulloch banned for the game on Friday, we have a chance!!
Happy birthday !!!! 18 at last #nolongerapred http://t.co/ULXZqWQ72f
Saved a penalty today.
Do you think McDowall even shouts at the players? I don't. So bloody toothless

Grazed about half my bumcheek at football yesterday and it's agony
Scored a hatrick today... Had never scored before in my 12 yr career
Come on Kenny, if we're going to have even a 100/1 chance you need to be up for it http://t.co/nh1LQvv6Qi
I will be happy for us to avoid a hammering, I mean if the big man upstairs is happy with new thought a wee Kenny Miller 1-0 would be &gt; life
3 points for Morton made the Forfar cold with it
Football is off so heading down the road to Forfar to watch the Ton!
