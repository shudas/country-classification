"It'll be like boner central!" -Big Ash 😂😂😂
Rangers !! Shit ahahaha
I've got to learn to put aside any negatives that I have in my life and just be thankful that I have such an outgoing and good looking girl.
Sometimes I'm way too patient.
There is no way that lady is a mom of a five year old...
I don't like the way this one kid's face looks when he strolls into class..
The atmosphere in this city right now is unlike any other 🔥🔥

Why in the hell would vampire diaries quotes twitter page follow me....
I almost got dummied by that revolving door..
Just got the dirtiest stare from this random girl walking by because I'm spitting the shells of my Spitz into a bottle..
She is now crying and proceeded to come sit about three feet away from me..
He didn't even say good morning to her.... What an ass. ✋
She is super jealous of something..... Just said "all the fans girls look at you cause you're a hot piece of ass"
She's coming closer 😯😐😑
Maybe go some place private?? Like seriously... You're sitting in front of a study area....
This girl sitting down the hall from me is legit having a yelling conversation with someone on the phone and now I know her whole life story
Stanley Cup Playoffs Eve 🏆
No clue how many of them are downstairs but they had better keep it down or else they'll face the wrath of mama bear 🐻
They stumble into my house now and have to leave at like 8:00 am 😂😂 #crazyteens
You act as if nothing is wrong 😕😞
I knew one day my actions would catch up with me. I like to think things are going my way but it just seems as though I'm always worrying.
Hitmen killing the Tigers tonight 👌👍
Blake called my Nike toms, fancy socks 😂
I'm counting on Bollig and Engelland to be big factors in our series against Vancouver. Rough and tumble play mixed with experience 👌
I am so excited for the #NHLPlayoffs
Today is my hump day. I want it over with and I'll be ecstatic.
I think our beds are comfiest on Monday mornings... 😕

We're only on this world briefly so we have to allow ourselves joy..
Isn't it interesting how the past is just a story we tell ourselves?
What if your butthole was in your armpit?
It was just you and me.... Everything else disappeared.
Kraft dinner and tater tots cause they remind me of her.
Yeah it was a good choice to wear this sweater.
Can't even close my one eye cause it hurts too much. Holy shit. This night sucks.
So frustrated and upset that no amount of sleep is gonna kill this one off. #allnighter

The cars in Furious 7 were 👌💦
If you saw Furious 7 and didn't even feel like you were going to cry at the end, than you aren't human #RIPPaulWalker
I think everybody who watches a fast and furious movie says "we're driving home like they did in the movie" afterwards
Do cars in fast and furious even use gas?? 😕😎
Conlen likes Captain America cause he's hot
Let the fastness and furiousness begin 😍
