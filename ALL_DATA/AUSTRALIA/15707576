Andrew Bolt, however, has grown beyond unpalatable and is a plight on the credibility of News Ltd as a news organisation. He has to go.

Siri, block out 90 minutes for "laying down and drooling on myself" after my dentist appointment.
She's correct about emphasis on research. Should extend to dementia, as part of comprehensive mental health and aging strategy. #qanda

Paul Murray on Sky spends a segment disparaging recently deceased Malcolm Fraser, then dubs people refusing to chat w/ cab drivers "nasty".

Will the contraction of the Australian automotive industry cause Ian Macfarlane problems in obtaining spare parts for his voicebox?
Will @JoeHockey pro-rata adjust his wage to account for time spent suing the media, rather than fixing cripplingly poor consumer confidence?
Very few things have given me as much joy as The Simpsons. Thanks for giving it to us. RIP Sam Simon.

If @asouthcottmp's pal MT becomes PM &amp; he returns to cabinet, will he have time to pen nasty letters about @HamiltonSmith to constituents?
Let's not kid ourselves that any leadership change is a dream result for Australia. A bad situation gets marginally better, at best.
Parties on the spectrum of self interest are not good for the nation. We need a government of fair, equitable goals &amp; pragmatic execution.
Malcolm Turnbull is no idiot, but in our Westminster system of government, cutting the head off the beast won't necessarily kill it.
ATTN: Mortgaged homeowners and Joe Hockey. Interest rate cuts actually mean the economy is rotten. Just a friendly reminder.

Life's too long to do small, unimportant, mediocre things. My gen. will probably live to 105. Can you imagine being bored for a century?
Given some recent personal events, all this impotent governance is at least slightly personally offensive.
Tax cuts in general in the post-GFC period seem void of sanity and driven by ideology.
Will a 1.5% tax cut really fix the small business skew in the corporate insolvency rate? Poor consumer confidence seems more relevant.
