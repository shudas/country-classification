Cable news anchors like Jon Oliver have a significant impact on news, eg #NetNeutrality #digitalnews #SXSW2015 requires credibility
Really interesting to see Pfeiffer's view of White House 'news' as 'content', using outreach and new channels #digitalnews #SXSW2015
How do you get your story out? @TheDanRather says good thinking &amp; good writing will go a long way #digitalnews #SXSW2015
How do you get your message out? Pfeiffer says understand your audience and go to where the conversation is happening #digitalnews #SXSW2015
If the evening news was the old national hearth as @TheDanRather, what is replacing it? #opinionsVSjournalism #digitalnews
The audience these days is so fractured, someone needs to be a honest broker for the information  #digitalnews #SXSW2015
Just tweeting with Monique, the @DigitalBne Coordinator, whilst I sit in Austin. I have the best team in the works #SXSW2015 #grateful
Rafter encourages us at #SXSW not to indulge in an orgy of technology, rather look at for what is it being used for? #digitalnews #hiswords
Scepticism is vital as a reporter, cynicism is fatal. However people don't always know the difference #digitalnews #SXSW2015
This discussion is articulating my long held issue with 'citizen journalism'. Citizen journalism is citizen opinion. #digitalnews #SXSW2015
Content is not news; news is however content. Wise words from Rather.  #digitalnews #SXSW2015
If a journalist needs to be liked, seduced by power and inner sanctums, you'll fail as being a good reporter #SXSW #digitalnews
Pfeiffer is impressive, but is arguments are blurring PR with news ... Appearances on Kinmel is about influence, not news #SXSW #digitalnews
Infotainment is no substitute for deep investigative journalism - Dan Rather #amen #digitalnews #SXSW2015
Rather argues that news should be what happens AFTER the event, not the press release. #SXSW2015 #digitalnews
