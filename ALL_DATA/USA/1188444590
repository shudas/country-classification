Boys suck
There's not one person that I can just tell everything to
I just wanna explain myself but you don't let me.
I just wanna cry
I hate that I love you
I don't need friends I hate people
Kinda sucks when someone you were so close with hates you
I really don't know why my makeup effects others so much, I think it's annoying that people really pick that to talk about. you have no life
What a "friend"
So sore and still don't feel good lol
Fire at @a_rickkk 's tonight!! Be there
 🔥😜
So happy to make the cheer team and get to cheer with my babes again love them so much. Varsity bout to take over
Cheer tryouts in an hour wassup

Jealous of anyone going to prom
