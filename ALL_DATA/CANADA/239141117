Sometimes listening to other people nod is the most goddamn irritating thing on the planet. GET IT TOGETHER, FLAILERS.
Waking up at 11 feels impossible. Nuuuu
I wonder how disappointed some people would be in my life decisions... Funny how sometimes strangers can mean more to you than friends.
I sit outside &amp; see the RV Park across the creek... I feel sad, I wish it was I that could afford beautiful cars &amp; vacations with loved ones

You are such an attention seeking whore.
You will NEVER realize how good my heart was until you find some other slut that never really cared about you, just like your last fucks😕
You disgusting whore; you ended up being EXACTLY what everyone said you were.
Haha bitch I saw you on Tinder; shows me how much I've really meant to you. Good riddance😂
Even I have a limit as to what I will and will not tolerate in any relationship (be it romantic or platonic).

chill night~
Being awake makes me want a cigarette. #smoking #cigarettes
My co-workers are seriously life savers 💕 Even if they're fucking crazy.
Being told that someone's love wasn't really love at all. I'm convinced. All I need is Twitter evidence. 😔
I miss you. http://t.co/Cxr9sL0yKF

Coworker drama. Can we just make some fucking #peace &amp; #pizza ??? #coworking 👌😓
Isolating myself again. Sometimes I think that's my brains way of telling me I need some good solid me time.
I'm not a bad person. I'm haunted by guilt for things I should not feel guilty for. #anxietyproblems
Don't go. I'm fighting for this. Coming out of the hole.
I always push everyone away. What the fuck is wrong with me. Letting it all out feels wrong. It's always been just me. Sorry isn't enough.😔

Tired of lazy co-workers and people who don't reciprocate the effort I put into caring about them. Fuck your hat; I need a vacation. Alone.
You and your bullshit. Everything you do is sketch; I ain't fucking with you no more.

I remember when all we wanted was each other and that felt fulfilling to me; that felt right.
The conversation I didn't want to have happened. I know things will change. Not my dream change. Can't have your cake &amp; eat it I suppose.
Fuck right off with your bad attitude, I'm not dealing with it today. Done trying to cheer you up, fucking sit there and MOPE. Nut.
