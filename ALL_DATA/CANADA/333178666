Apparently me sweating is more offensive than the extremely racist remarks being made #familylogic
I get I should have been at school sooner, but it would have been nice to know I couldn't access my locker @unbc
The fact that I'm about to drop $800 on wall paper for a house I don't even own yet is the sole reason I shouldn't have a credit card

May not have been Europe but Victoria was just as beautiful
I like the fact that his cat likes me more then the fact that he likes me.
I just want a studio apartment where I can drink coffee in bed and watch the city go by
I do this thing where I eat till it hurts, I'm so full right now I can't move but all I want is to finish my left overs....
When your dad doesn't think you can conquer a male dominated industry #sexistprick

Planing on taking out extra savings just for roll up season ! #socanadian #hello6thseason
Being thought about in the middle of the night has got to be the best feeling 🙈#bae
#BellLetsTaIk about how finally being 'weak' enough to ask for help was the strongest thing I ever did.
Good morning ! Today's my favorite day of the year #BellLetsTaIk #BellLetsTaIk
You were hung over and smelt like a brewery. All you wanted to do was nap and cuddle. And in that moment I loved you like never before.

Do you know how scary it is to be a sick child. Shut up and stop undermining his fear. He has no idea what's going on.
Your tone means everything to a child. Simple questions should not be answered with attitude I don't care how annoying they seem
Want your child to not be a victim? Stop being their biggest bully.
I fucking hate first years #shutup #whycometoclass
3 years later I find out that I have a wiper deicer... That would have been useful these last 3 winters
Mock 3, lets do this

I miss you
Shout out to the 9th grader at the mall in a Hells Gate beer shirt #goingplaces
veggies and hummus is a terrible substitution for pulled pork grilled cheese

I swear 7th grade Kelsey just walked into my doctors office. #ohdeargod
Apartment hunting in the city is my new favorite hobby
The thing that makes exams worth while is knowing Im that much closer to being back in the office. I just love my job so much! #westfraser
Give me rain, and lattes, and cramped apartments, and commutes, and cute heels and cooking on a budget.  Give me a city to conquer
Never say never.  Super excited to find out what next september holds for me
Memo to me: invest in decaf coffee so you're not wide away at 3 am
Just over 7 weeks till i'm marked up like a train back in the eighties #snapbacksandtattoos
I will forever be that girl who eats her feelings #givemeallthecarbs #orgivememydogback 😔
If you complain about being broke but plan on bringing another expensive life into this world I am judging you
Today we lost one of the good ones #goodbyepep #wewillmissyou
Things I need to do today: Clean. Things I have yet to do today: Get out of bed.
Just realized Ive been putting the wrong student number on all my midterms and tests Thank god for a university where profs know you by name
Dad will joke about being KKK but will condemn religions treatment of women #missguided
Getting a 50 on a paper you actually worked on has got to be the worst feeling in the world
So I may or may not be getting drunk and learning how to knit #turnup #whatfinal
Thank you 😊
