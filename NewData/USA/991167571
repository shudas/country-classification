As much as I dislike PK Subban there is no need for the racism coming out of a lot of morons mouths.#NHL is supposed to be better than that.
Heluva game going on in Montreal.  #OTTvsMTL

#Pens were the second worst team in hockey since ASG, and we still made playoffs, what happens if we return to form from first half? #beware
Welcome to the playoffs boys.  Despite many injuries, clots mumps ect you get your chance to bring Lord Stanley back to Pittsburgh #turnitup
Maybe buffalo should have played without a goalie all year probably would have got same result.
Really hope Sutter get the HT
By nights end @chigh666 may be my enemy for roughly two weeks.  Probably will get NYR round one.
Fleury fleury fleury
And with that goal the sphincters of everyone in #Boston tightened at an unbearable rate.

Jamie Benn now tied with Tavares and Sid i believe.
Heads up hockey Perron.  @usahockey
Found this old beauty and hung it up just now between periods, If we win its staying up.    #goodjuju #LetsGoPens http://t.co/f20weQWf5J
Pretty sure I tweeted yesterday for someone to run the goalie.....good job sid where's Colby armstrong when we need him.
We also need Bobrosky to shut down Tavares. Let's get Sid a scoring championship also in route to the playoffs.
Alright Pens lets start a 17 game win streak today. #getafterit #pushfortheplayoffs
Always good to air out the gear especially after a powerskating practice. #baldwindevelopmental #mite #77 http://t.co/AL759qHkyX
When their struggling that much run into the goalie do something.
#WIN29JERSEY @ROOTSPORTSPIT

If Rob Scuderi scores and we lose we don't deserve to win

Doh Its DK day.
Looking forward to @MarkMaddenX  opening today.  Should be an epic Pens rant.
I hate rainy mornings.
Lovejoy went from playing with Fowler and looking good because of him to essentially another scuderi on our team. They are not good.

How do we outplay a team this bad and still be losing?
We most miss Bennett being in the box he is invisible out there anyways.
Pretty sad Kunitz got punched for shooting it and still not scoring
