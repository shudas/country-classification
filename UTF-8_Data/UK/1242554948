Well said Ed Milliband.  
Why don't you have some courage and start to contemplate a progressive allianc with SNP &amp; greens.  #BBCDebate
#BBCDebate Nicola puts you know who back in his box. http://t.co/NIe1H5E3sU
Dimbleby puts Farage in his place.  #BBCDebate
So labour support the right to buy.  Not a good idea #WheresDave  #BBCDebate
Sturgeon's playing a blinder!  #BBCDebate
The women are ganging up on Milliband. They're doing great.  #BBCDebate
First full round of applause to Nicola.  Yahoo!! #BBCDebate

This is what I call a proper party political broadcast.

Ed. Nicola will be on your case as soon as you step out of line! #leadersdebate
First round of applause to Sturgeon's passionate statement on university education! #leadersdebate
#leadersdebate
The women are winning the immigration question by a mile. Do these guys have any compassion?
Sturgeon just talks common sense.  Plain and simple.  #leadersdebate
Half time. Sturgeon leading by a couple of goals. Milliband struggling. .. #leadersdebate
Is anyone going to inject some passion into this. The only person coming close is Nicola Sturgeon standing up for Scotland.  #leadersdebate
Ed has had debate prep which went like this...'whatever you're asked reply to the camera'! #leadersdebate
Go Nicola.  Where are the cuts David?  #leadersdebate
These men in suits don't like intelligent women putting forward an alternative politics! #leadersdebate
£30 billion of cuts. Why did you do it Ed? #leadersdebate
