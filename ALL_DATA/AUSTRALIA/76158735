My mom and grandparents, how funny! My pop once had black hair! http://t.co/7dKrP8Gbrl
Just went in a louboutin store and tears formed because I'm so poor.
How funny would that be?!
So tempted to just put my feet in one of their laps.
Shout out to the 14 year old couple making out in the seat that faces me on the train.
A lot of people in Australia are genuine nickelback fans and that seriously concerns me.

This house is so creepy. I hate being alone here. Especially at night.
People who delete people off social media for sports are pathetic.
Always ready to nap.
BO SOXXXXXXXXX ⚾️❤️
This kind of looks like an older @S_Malhotra 😂😘 http://t.co/dJHJ7utwiN
Let go of my hand. You don't give a damn and it's killing me.

Second chances are rarer than I.
So mad.
This. 😂😂😂😂 @Jonjamo http://t.co/byAcmfs7ei
It's not always how it seems. Ask before assuming. Always. You'll save yourself a lot.
I don't understand why people can't just leave things.
Who is stalking me?!
I've moved like 3 km in 20 minutes. 👊
Also roundabouts are stupid.
I want to meet the person who designed Sydney's roads and I want to throat punch them.

Terrigal beach with this 💩 n_knox https://t.co/pz8I8KuPy2
Terrigal beach 😍 thanks to @nknoxy12 I'm never leaving this town. http://t.co/XvQfYuP5gD
Australia has changed me and I'm never going back to how I was before. I'm a happier and healthier person now.
There's a world outside the BBN, I promise. It'll make you see everything differently and you'll learn so much more if you just travel!
Best decision I've ever made was leaving Lexington. That place is like a black hole that just suck the life out of people.
I don't see how people are content with staying in Lexington their whole lives. There is a whole world out there. GO SEE IT.
It's funny how every time you push me away you turn around and beg me to stay.
