Nothing like a victory against Liverpool. #MUFC #DaveSaves
Also agree with Souness (for once) re: Rooney - he is droppable &amp; isn't in the same league as Ronaldo and Messi. It's Scotland.
Probably one of the worst football games I've witnessed for a long time but great to see Ronaldo back at Old Trafford #ARGvsPOR
Quick word on #mufc - disappointed (w/Smalling &amp; defeat) but not disheartened (character shown which was massively lacking last year)

I'm gutted to see Welbeck go. 

But I'm absolutely delighted with Falcao. Our attack üòÅüëå

Previous RT - Anything related to Di Maria will distract how terrible we are. #mufc

#Summerslam is the one event of the year Cena is happy to go over clean. Batista, Bryan, Lesnar etc. Buzzing #BrockVsCena

The signings of Shaw and Herrera have been a massive boost for #mufc but losing Howard Webb is a massive blow #HowardWebb #MUFC
