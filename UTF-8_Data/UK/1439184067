10 actual days left of school, that's so crazy 😁
just want to move to glasgow nowwww🙍🏻
it isn't ok for you to block me out like this
I'm so bad at overthinking about things that I want to happen because it hurts too much realising and accepting they won't😓
I can't stand it when someone gives me mixed signals, like either be nice to me or don't, it's not fair😔
😒
hate when people pretend like they're someone's friend but they just treat them like total shit😒
people wouldn't be put off politics if the parties didn't waste their time bashing and calling each other everything 😒
