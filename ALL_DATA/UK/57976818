So far it seems I have to buy fabric for a toga then pay entrance to a party I'll only be at for a few hours. #PartyHard
Also females that wear Togas are sex workers
Like only Roman citizens are allowed to wear them

How come people complain about stereotypically dressing as a nationality. But not with Togas

Struggling to stay awake.
My evening is free. I have nothing to do
Thank god the bank was a simple 5 minute thing. And not an awkward purchase
#PerfectTweet
Also if the bank thought someone else was using my card they should at least call me more than once to notify me my card has been cancelled.
Damn it HSBC declining my card again for a purchase I've made before.
My netflix redirected to a T-mobile site, was very strange.
Watching lost when Suddenly...... http://t.co/1vhOo7KScy
