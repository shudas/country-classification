Massive decision to be made today. Leave Australia in 1 month or in 2-3 years. Wow
Listened to Origin of Symmetry, Absolution and Showbiz in the last week. I miss old muse.
Happy #indyref day. It would be sad to see a break up. To me it's a case of making a point for some. A point they can't reverse.
So over the week the line outside the sydney apple store has grown. It now goes round the corner and included tents. MAD #iPhone6
Went to my first preview screening of a film last week. Russell Crowe's debut as a director is pretty impressive.
