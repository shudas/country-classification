I miss you. And I shouldn't. And I really hate that.
With the kind of luck I have, the thought of doing Riot control training today terrifies me a little...#yikes
I'm done college. Wow. I'm actually done college. What a bittersweet thought.
I don't understand people who never stop talking. Like how.
Wow. It's my last day of college...as if.
What you eat during finals week doesn't count 💁
Red Bull is bae. #examgrind
And fyi the paper is also due tomorrow...hahaha oops. #yikes
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good...and by that I mean I still haven't studied for my two finals tomorrow or written my paper yet...
Really struggling with the concept that I'm writing my last college paper ever right now and the I'm done college as of tomorrow. #what
So...about that final paper I'm supposed to be writing.
Looks like it's going to be a beautiful last week in the bay☺️
Perogie pizza is actually the highlight of my job.
I have never been more frustrated by a paper before in my life as I am with this one. #ijustwantittobeover
Really not looking forward to this 12 hour shift I have ahead of me today.
I don't know how to cope anymore.

Laying in bed drinking tea and reading Robert Frost is the best distraction from a bad day.
Sending out an SOS for soda crackers and Advil
Wow.
IDFWU 💁
People are fake. Pizza is real. ✌🏻
"I'm going to do my paper today"... just kidding I'm going to wait till the day before it's due and then cry about how much I have to do💁
K. No. #byefelicia
Analyzing and episode of CSI for a 5 page essay is a lot harder than expected...#effthisman
One day. http://t.co/1k4zMNJH7p
You're not over it if it still makes you angry.
Bad times make the good times better
I love this place more than you know. http://t.co/bCsGl1Seqh
So. Many. Perogies.
Passed my fitness exam and can now officially graduate from college!!! 🎉💃🎉🎉
Well that's quite the change.
I'm so overdue for a little bit of too good to be true...I'm so overdue for someone like you
"I don't even know what this is."
 - my prof, as he opens a PowerPoint for a lecture. Oh my lanta...#yikess #thisiswhatipaidfor?
What a wonderful Easter this turned out to be 🐰💕
Food coma #stuffed
As much as I wanted to be home for Easter, sometimes all you need are cozy blankets and best friends to spend holidays with. #2ndfamily
Oh my 😍
Walmart causes so much anxiety...yikes
My apartment smells like cupcakes☺️
I'm in a chocolate coma
I've been left unattended with an unreasonable amount of Easter chocolate and homemade cookies...#yikes
Get to see the family soon ❤️
Literally 2 seconds away from falling apart #whyy
Why do all the worst things have to happen all at once😭😭
I just ate an unreasonable amount of perogies  #oops #ohwell
The only reason I work out is because I eat literally everything.
Sleeping through classes like its my job 😴
Clearly I'm really good at reading situations the wrong way #whatisgoingonman
Peanut butter should be its own food group.
I want to take a nap so badly but nope I have to go to work. #firstworldproblems
I found ducks playing in a stream today while out for my run. Hopefully spring is finally here🌼 #pleaseletitbespring
The almost of naps I've been taking recently is actually unreasonable #somuchsleep
Spaghetti squash is actually the coolest thing I have ever made!
Its always sad writing a letter of resignation for a job you have grown to love. Im actually going to miss working at boston pizza #surpised
No worse feeling than receiving a letter of rejection for your dream career...#crushed
Just slept for almost 14 hours. Tired? I think so...
My talents include falling asleep unexpectedly and eating food. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Spending my Saturday at school...why did I agree to this again?
Photobooths are wonderful creations
Home for all of an hour between school and volunteering jobs...and I wonder why I'm burnt out 😒
What a wonderful night ☺️ #happy
I just burnt spinach and I don't understand how.
You never realize how important the component of milk is when making a smoothie until you try and make one with no milk. #thissucks
When only 4 people show up and the teacher still teaches 😒 #pointless
Burnout.
Avoiding all responsibility by watching Netflix and baking 💁
solid 45 minute shift...#ButINeedTheMoneyyyy
I just killed 3 hours at the gym...not sure how that happened. #gainsss #ithinkitsbedtimenow
"How mad would you be if you peed in my bed" -Alyssa
Alright.
I actually just bought the coolest SnapBack hat ever covered in parrots and it just makes me really happy guys.
It isn't a normal day in North Bay unless you go to twiggs😍 http://t.co/9vW7HGOHuq
The girls are here! Time for a much needed girls weekend ❤️👸
My level of motivation is at zero right now and idgaf at all...this is bad. I'm literally going to fail my test tomorrow.
My iPod has come back to life!!! Yessss🙌🙌🙌
My iPod has stopped working. My life is basically over. I need my music 😭😭😭 #noooooo
Sums up my life nicely👌 #endoftheyeargrind http://t.co/puqzBkzt3F
RIP to my sleeping schedule 😒 #ExhaustionAtItsFinest
St. Patrick's day has consisted of me drinking baileys and coffee alone in my room while studying for a law test. #beingresponsiblesucks
200 surveys, 20 pages, 1 power point presentation, and a million paper cuts. The semester long research project is finally done🙌🙌
Whyyyyy
12 pages later and counting... I never want to do another research report as long as I live.
This project is making me lose my mind. I cannot wait for this semester to be over 😒
Tea and Netflix is the best way to spend a day off work 👌
You can love someone but never as much as you can miss them
42. The answer is 42.
Dropped my headphones in water....do they still work? Oh yeah they do! #yessssss
My eyeliner is too perfect and on point today for this crying shit so you and your attitude can get lost right now.
Thank god for ball caps
Also class starts in 5 minutes and 3 people have shown up. Even the prof isn't here...
8am classes are starting to kill. On the plus side I'm the master of the 10 minute dash from bed to the bus stop💁 #needtosleep
Tests on tests on tests on tests
People only want me when they need something and it's really starting to suck.
Day two of the spring weather trail runs around North bay, loving life☺️ #nothingmoreperfect
"What are you doing with your life?"....uhm it's a suprise.
Also I'm really proud of myself and the fact that all my graphs for my stats actually look good and not like 12 year old did them💁
Unexplainably happy for season 3 of bates motel starting tonight!!!!!!!
Drowning in surveys doing statistics🙅 #thissucks
Beauty day for a run to the Duchesnay Falls❤️ the view was totally worth the pain of running uphill. #northbaylovin http://t.co/AgRsuK7Ne9
That's exactly what you were to me
If college has taught me anything these past two years it's that you can't rely on anyone but yourself. Learnt that the hard way...#life
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
I tweet about applying to the RCMP while writing an assignment in blue crayon. #welcometocollege #lifegoals
Time to make huge life choices...time to prep to write the RCMP entry exam.
Trying to convince my mother to get a cat likes its my day job. #pleasetheyresocute
Mind in one place, heart in another
When I sit in the sauna at the gym I like to close my eyes and pretend I'm somewhere tropical. It makes winter go away for those 30 minutes.
Why yes, I do have a problem with you. Thanks for asking💁
Blue are the words I say and what I think
The fact I consider going to bed at 3am as "early" probably isn't that great. #sleepingisoverrated
I could be a morning person if morning happened around noon...
Confidence is key. Love yourself✌️
Au naturel.
They really need to make the bags of Crisper bigger
Earned it - The weeknd 👌
All day at placement followed by an 8 hour shift all to get to spend another 10 hours there all day tomorrow. #ilovemylife
RIP Leonard Nimoy :( #whatasaddaythisis
The fact I have to be at placement at 7am on a Friday on reading week is really unappealing to me🙅 #nothankyou
Randomly winning a bursary from your college that you didn't apply for is always a really nice surprise! #whyareyougivingmethis #thankful
My stress level has officially maxed out #thefrustrationisreal
All I want is a @yesahco watch please and thank you 😍 #amazing
I feel like a Mac Book will be my next investment...PC is just really starting to make me angry.
I feel like I might regret the two hours I just spent at the gym tomorrow when I have to carry trays of glasses and food at work...
I might as well just take a sleeping bag to work and live there since I'm never actually anywhere else...
I was planning on being productive before going to work today...but then friends happened. And by friends I mean the show..
Warmer weather would be much appreciated already North Bay...#kthanksbye
10 shifts in 6 days...let the work life struggle begin. #ijustlovemyjobsomuchguys #justkidding
Finding my old Twitter account from grade 10 is probably the funniest thing I have ever found.
I have an unhealthy obsession with ugly sweaters and cat shirts. #ISwearImNotAHipster #Honest
I like living alone because I never actually have to use a cup when I drink juice and there's no one to judge me ever💁
There is nothing more true. http://t.co/yiJ8mH3cGE
Living in residence really sucks when it's reading week and you have no one else in residence to hangout with. #longweekahead
