Apparently he left us for Naughty Boy and now I'm crying because it means we weren't important to him 😫
Goodnight everyone. Stay safe. 💞 xx

But the new album will never be the same. 😖

Today. Is probably the worst day ever!
Dreams aren't real!
I don't believe in dreams anymore. Because they don't come true at all.  All I wanted was to see and meet 5/5. And I can't and won't! 😫
