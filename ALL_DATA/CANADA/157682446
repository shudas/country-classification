Listen to Talking with Drex on CKNW980 about Contact 2014 by Geneva Vanderberg #np on #SoundCloud https://t.co/axUONazlhE
Pub caught on fire there on Marine and Gilley. Yikes. Can we say alcohol abuse. @AM730Traffic
Have you heard ‚ÄòTalking with Drex on CKNW980 about Contact 2014‚Äô by Geneva Vanderberg on #SoundCloud? https://t.co/nGSgv8UVXU
#CONTACT2014 website claims that they can confiscate "unsealed" tampons. Well some one fucked up now didn't they?
^^ it was done by a male security guard. No tampons inside BC Place to purchase. And completely uncalled for in general. #CONTACT2014
Went on CKNW tonight to talk about #CONTACT2014 and all it's nonsense. Taking tampons away from young girls in front of their friends? BS!
Hanging out with @DuffieldBryce at @AM730Traffic bringing the latest on the #seatosky #LionsBay accident. What a mess!
Christmas Day view from the @AM730Traffic Centre. Beautiful. Gotta love the perks of the job! #Vancouver #Christmas http://t.co/KRNbjY1kLM
Wow, very busy at the borders!!! Tune @AM730Traffic for the most up to date border wait times and traffic information! #traffic #Vancouver
Merry Christmas to my friends, family, and work fam. Love and happiness to you all. @CKNW @AM730Traffic

Nothing is "supernatural."  Everything is natural. It's just those who are afraid that find it to be this way.

Love my cat but sleeping with him in my bed sucks. No where to put my legs but he's comfy. That's all that matters...
