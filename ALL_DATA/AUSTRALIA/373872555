I don't think I'll ever make a big room track XD 2 obnoxious 4 me
I knew should have stayed in bed this morning. Can't deal with this place much longer
Everything is so frustrating lately, Rawr! -_-
I enjoy music that isn't tainted by the music industry's greed
I dislike music that purely exists to make money.
FUN FACT: I ADORE YOU
1 more hour and I have 4 days off..  It's sad how exciting this is for me xP
