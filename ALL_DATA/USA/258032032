when ur in algebra 2 and all time low is attacking u http://t.co/QL99ikaKIN
don't sweat it. forget it. everything is a-okay.
sometimes I follow people just bc they're attractive and I have no shame ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
you deserve to be hated but every time I look at you my knees go weak
I wish I could hate you
if I could forget all our memories (the good and the bad) and not remember your name, I would do it in a heartbeat.
I wish I'd never met you
have you ever seen something or someone and felt like you've been punched in the stomach
I'm honestly trying so hard not to cry
when you want to do nothing but crawl in bed and cry for the rest of your existence but you're at school
only hate the road when you're missing home
only know you've been high when you're feeling low
only know you love her when you let her go
only miss the sun when it starts to snow
the music choices for these videos have concerned me
I am so so so so exhausted
except for the fact that my face looks like a pepperoni pizza but it's totally fine
i just feel so at peace with everything
im so much happier when i spend time with God regularly tbh
my dog ate my mini corn dogs I'm pissed
but jasey rae!!!!!
kinda bummed there's no remembering sunday. that's the first all time low song I ever heard http://t.co/qev79nrkcT
forever thankful for this guy and his dedication to the Lord. so blessed to have him as a friend http://t.co/amT1ivTCT0
I don't understand why everyone is so inconsiderate
crying bc I miss them sm http://t.co/bdUhdZ1Sjb
rly want to crack them
if I break my egg babies do I still have to carry them around
wish Keri would text me back
my head hurts so bad
I want to sleep in Mikayla's bed tonight
my teeth are gonna be so pretty when I get my braces off I can't WAIT
thankful for a God who cares about ME
thankful for a God who cares about the little things
thankful for a God who is faithful when no one else is
Alex Gaskarth's voice gives me chills honestly
remembering sunday live on straight to DVD aka stab me in the chest
or maybe I'll still miss you with every breath I take
maybe it'll be better when you go off to college
I'm so hungry and there's just no food in this house
or Wendy's chicken nuggets
or some French fries
I want cheese pizza
when everything hurts but ur natural brow game is on point http://t.co/DcUMeTZ0Al
