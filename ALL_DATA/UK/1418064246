Huge blunder by the LibDems and Tories not to participate in that debate, you have to say. Publicity is oxygen in politics.
A *Millionaire Newspaper Owner* has given *millions of pounds* to UKIP to "Shake up the Establishment". Astounding scenes.
HUMZA. HUMZA Yousaf. #BBCDebate
Nigel Farage talking about the NHS #BBCDebate http://t.co/mxNV62Optt
Farage bringing up HIV patients again. Utter disgrace. Grateful Ed Milliband pointed out Coburn's shameful slur of Yousaf. #BBCDebate
Man blaming what is caused by cuts on immigration. #BBCDebate http://t.co/5rMh6NxjyE
Nigel Farage so far in this debate. #BBCDebate http://t.co/SVU4ZVk85e
Nigel Farage attacking the audience for being left wing. Astounding. http://t.co/uIoZAMnF9y
And now Labourites attacking Sturgeon for her parents buying their council house seconds before Ed Milliband says "we support right to buy".
Attacking Nicola because her parents bought their Council house is pathetic and asinine.

Couldn't fit the hashtag into the previous tweet but you can guess which one it's related to.
Colleague at Uni worked as a sales rep &amp; got so fed up of being chatted up started saying she was married with children. Stopped instantly.

"All of Us First!"
"We don't pay students."
The Common Weal, ladies and gents.
As I pulled into uni, Classic FM started playing Star Wars. Added a distinct sense of ceremony. "The time is 0813..."
Just a wee reminder that PeTA are absolutely awful.

Have to miss a job interview because of uni. A case study trip to Longannet was also just axed for obvious reasons. https://t.co/wkOn940gKK
This, by yer @FraserDick, is an excellent and astute look at the "rent-seeking economy" and Tory manifesto. https://t.co/7IYnxiVNpV
If anything the RTB extension idea is symptomatic of the fact that, to the Tory Party, ideology trumps not only economics but reality itself
http://t.co/YShwysX45n head of National Housing Federation - "Of all the daft ideas Iâ€™ve heard in a career in housing, this is the daftest."
http://t.co/hHO2yxqBqU The Tories' flagship right-to-buy policy looks like an utter shambles.
http://t.co/Mw82vGq4WR "UK opposes international ban on developing 'killer robots'". What a headline. #toughonSkynettoughonthecausesofSkynet
Well if this isn't the worst idea I've ever heard in my life https://t.co/PYkaVLOT1f
That Labour are prepared to countenance, for even a second, such claims is utterly despicable.
Tasmina is where she is because she's a tremendously hard working and dedicated activist. She was chosen by our branch absolutely on merit.
They've defended claims Tasmina Sheikh got where she is because she had a "close relationship with Salmond".
http://t.co/AB5nda8Zs0 a Labour spokesperson has *actually defended* an attack on Tasmina based on her race. Unacceptable.
There's nowt wrong with being conversational in your writing, I should say, but at least try not to sound like a rank amateur as you do so.
That last pic is cut and pasted from here, in case you want them in their original context: http://t.co/xe3yhTtLZg
Dugdale's a well educated, capable woman- she's clearly not daft. Why, then, does she write like an S2 with a penchant for comma splice?
I was hounded for this kind of stuff in standard grade- in fact, before even then. http://t.co/7847N7IAmF
Dugdale continues to be a laughably bad writer. That the shadow cab sec for education can barely meet secondary school grammar is astounding
The Greens have a campaign poster which is just loads and loads of words. Loads and loads and loads of words. http://t.co/YkRK6Na9c6

Wish there was a 5-a side equivalent to Melrose. End up with someone like Gibraltar playing Albion Rovers in the final. Amazing.
