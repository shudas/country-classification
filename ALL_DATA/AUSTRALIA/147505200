5/5 Fazenda Pedra Grande, Sul de Minas. New Crop naturals cupping really well! http://t.co/dAexq2SPuD
4/5 Fazenda Pedra Grande, Sul de Minas http://t.co/dg7s3ykjQT
3/5 Flowering at Fazenda Pedra Grande, Sul de Minas. Producing Mundo Novo, Yellow Catuai and Yellow Bourbon naturals http://t.co/L68cYAVkqy
2/5 Fazenda Pedra Grande, Sul de Minas. Cooler climate in this region has meant not very affected by the drought http://t.co/qbv5sS4rId

4/5 Patios of naturals at Fazenda Aurea http://t.co/wwMo753EbD
3/5 Early flowering at Fazenda Aurea. Small amount of new growth is really concerning for 2015/16 crop volumes. http://t.co/pUKNozaCEW
2/5 Harvesting at Fazenda Aurea. Enormous farm, this year's production estimated at being 30,000 bags, down 40% http://t.co/M3ZfG4ybzr
1/5 During harvest at Fazenda Aurea, Cerrado, where we source our Moreninha Formosa from. Cup is excellent this year! http://t.co/umFSCTo3tN
2/2 ...in Cerrado, and some stable production on some of the farms we visited in Sul de Minas. Some great coffees this year regardless!
1/2 Back on Sao Joazinho, Mogiana after a great trip up Nth through Sul de Minas &amp; Cerrado. Some heavy crop reductions at Moreninha Formosa
Whilst here visiting, team at home just glowingly approved preships of 1st box of S√£o Joazinho, Moreninha, Aurea, Pedra Grande &amp; Coromandel!
In Esp√≠rito Santo do Pinhal, S√£o Paulo state. Great cupping of farms we are working with in Campestre, Monte Santo de Minas and Cerrado!!
6/6 due to lack of mature fruit, &amp; lots of floater naturals being processed. Further updates to come as we travel up north through Cerrado
5/6 Lots of green cherry on patios as would never have ripened fully under these conditions. Far more naturals than pulped nats this year
4/6 On Cambara for beginning of year usually between 1200-2000ml rain-this year not even 500 ml. Maturation very quick &amp; left a lot of green
3/6 Carmo one of worst hit regions in Brazil from lack of rain, though effects not as drastic as some areas due to altitude and topography.
2/6 Most are near complete with harvest and some with around 20% to go. Across the board volumes of producers we visited down between 30-50%
1/6 Amongst all this beauty here in Carmo and some stellar cups, the stark reality is that the drought has really hit hard...
