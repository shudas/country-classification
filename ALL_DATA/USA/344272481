I seriously hate the restaurant industry
When I'm done with school for the week but it's just the beginning of my work week. #shootme
I want to go shopping. Tax return please come in soon! 💸
When the kitchen specials are Mexican food &amp; the they hook me up. I am loved 😍
Seriously frustrating when there's only one other person to cover your shift because they don't want to hire anyone else. 😓
Seriously in the worst mood &amp; just over everything..
Looks like I'll be taking my anatomy &amp; physiology class again. There's no way imma pass with an 80% after this exam...
Because who wants to go to bed just to be up by six in the am &amp; take a Bio exam first thing 😖🔫
That just hit my heart a little bit. Why...
Oma has the worst lucky flying standby. The woman just needs to invest in normal international plane tickets like the rest of us 😑
I should have dropped my bio class a long time ago 😲
These pics help keep me going when all I want to do is give up when I study.❤️ http://t.co/2nVdWFjYpP
It's sad when people create drama &amp; stop being your friend for literally no reason but self guilt &amp; stupidity..
When I play christian music and Ellie always lays right by my phone and listens &lt;3
Uhm where the hell this wind come from?!
I just want my new car already but I also want a college education 😕
I tend to release stress &amp; emotions thru bitch mode towards my loved ones...
It's crazy how fast &amp; unexpected God brings people back home. RIP Cat.. Prayers to your family &amp; friends 💖
When my cousin's husband asks how she knows everything he's about to do &amp; her response is "cuz you're mine" 💕
I seriously just got attacked by the little neighbor kid
I miss training with the fight team! Can't wait to move back to the valley soon! @king_edwin20 👊🏼💥
"Whatever" has obviously been my favorite phrase lately &amp; it's annoying
I remember back in 8th grade I knew nothin bout sex or even talked about marriage. All I cared about was getting out of PE &amp; making it to hs
Oh man Ellie is going to hate me next week. #yearlyexam  🐾💉
When Oma leaves I'm totally going to get myself a new tattoo &amp; I simply can't wait! 😊
Uhh I miss little man 😕
All I want to do is eat &amp; sleep. Not study or work ..
I'm getting the hook ups left &amp; right &amp; couldn't be more thankful.
I have my daddy's tongue &amp; temper #sorrynotsorry
The last 37 minutes of my life have been fucking worthless &amp; really put me in a pissy ass mood
Some people just don't think..
Bout to find out how fat I've gotten since the wedding 😕
These girls talking bout how they get to go to country thunder &amp; talking bout how they are excited to go up north 😂 Bitches please....
The pharmacist knows me by name &amp; what I come in for already after just three times coming in 😳
It's so nice to see my credit card at $0 😊
Well this is pointless..
&amp; the jealousy of everyone going to country thunder starts....... Now.
Twenty seven dollars for a new car battery. Damn I love my personal hookups #blessed
I love Oma to death but she drives me insane....
I really don't have the time money or gas for this bullshit
Out of all fucking days this day has to be the worst.
Ellie seriously wines &amp; stops me from leaving without her at night 💔
I have the goofiest friends 😅
I am sooooo full!!
Really gotta buckle down on my anatomy tonight. I will finish this class with an 80%..🙏
Just great... The class I've been ditching I finally decide to go &amp; my car battery decides to die 😡
I probably add at least 2 "people you may know" a day. #creepin 😂
He's seriously soo sweet to me, I can't even 😊
So for the first time I move Ellie to the other side of the bed for me to lay down &amp; she growls at me. Excuse me bitch..  ✋
What can I say.. I have one damn good looking family 😘
Hearing all the compliments I got this weekend really feels nice! 😊
Seriously one of my favorite things to do #cosmopark #dogpark #elliemae http://t.co/AC3wke1IwK
Nap time before my last class of the day &gt;&gt;&gt;
Furious 7 with babe! ❤️
Surprised but thankful. Actually really happy we get along.
Stuck at work till fuckin five 🔫
Hungover at work? Just chug some bourbon before anyone sees 😂
I'm drunk &amp; we are having a sleep over at my BFs with my parents.. Oh man...
My parents just got down on the dance floor 😂
They are so fucking perfect
They are marrrrrrrried !!!! Yay!
We're hot they're not! #bridesmaid
I just can't wait to see my parents tomorrow
Couldn't stay away from nails for too long. So glad I had an excuse to do so! 😋💅
I hate growing up.. Another year I didn't get to color eggs :/
Don't call me to say we have plans just for them not to happen..
Picking up Oma tonight yaaaay ha
Way too dehydrated to work right now Uhh! Gonna be a long night...😲
Doing a heavy duty call with the babe today. Bout to get a last minute workout before the wedding!
Just because I'm a girl doesn't mean I am weak..
Okay maybe not crazy but definitely busy.
This week is seriously the craziest most stressful week I've experienced yet.
That doesn't make sense...
Who wants to let me have $250 ?! #fml #ticketssuck #speedracerrr 😓
Now if we're talkin bodies, u got a perfect one, so put it on me. Swear it won't take u long. If u love me right... we fuck for life.. 💋
Drunk off wine &amp; family time!
Talks about energy of the body &amp; how to control my panic attacks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"We lost everything in the storm. I was just sad about my lunchbox"
I want to minor in Nutrition.
Feel free to bring me breakfast in bed
I like to sleep in, leave me alone.
This show on Netflix is so dumb but hilarious !
Met another bridesmaid today &amp; finished up SOME of the wedding crafts. Starting to finally feel apart of the wedding. #excited
Realizing I could have gone home two hours ago really stinks but I got a good head start on my essay so it's okay.
I suck at writing papers. The end.
My cousin gets married this weekend &amp; I'm actually so excited to be apart of it !
I remember when my car was all clean &amp; pretty now it's all dented &amp; tucked up.
Jk I'm not ready for this 😐
Late night homework plus gonna finish studying my ass off for my Lab exam. I will ace this one #determined
I will not let anyone talk down on me the way I have been before. That shit just hurts no matter who you are to me.
Cosmo park fun before heading back up to PHX. #muchneeded #lovemypeiby
I have such a hard working man 😍
Tonight has been the longest night of work ever. My feet are killing me !
Don't piss me off because Karma's a bitch.
I hate doubles because I always come home &amp; just wanna stay in bed for the rest of the day instead of going back..
Free meal at Dave an Busters tonight seriously just got to walk out without pulling out my wallet #blessed
Work tonight was hell. I'm glad I wasn't alone. Ready to just put my feet up.
When you're the only bridesmaid that's under age &amp; can't go to Vegas 😭😭
Ellie likes to "dig" a spot on the pillows &amp; blankets to burry her bones haha. She's such a nut. #ilovemydog
Got complimented today at work from boss man. It means a lot when my hard work is noticed. #thankful
Actually this whole week...
Today has been the worst day of the month...
Honesty.. A trait that's hard to find in people.
Guess I'll go to work since I didn't get anything else accomplished today 😓
I'm alive because He lives 🙌
But the kitchen always lets me make my own dessert so in the end I'm loved so it's okay.
I'm so easy to pick on at work 😓
Not in the mood for poor attitudes tonight
I'm over feeling like this 😷
Is hogging the bed seriously necessary ?! #dogpeopleproblems
Fast 7, the longest ride, &amp; sooo many other movies I want to see this month. Someone get me a movie pass!
I'm mean like early high school young &amp; dumb.. Ohhhh take me back.
Remember when we were all young &amp; dumb ?!
School, new car, future dreams.. So much stuff I gotta save for &amp; I keep dipping into my savings for things like credit card payments &amp; gas.
When buying food for your dog becomes more of a priority then buying food for yourself 😕
Someone take me back to the country please.
Throwing it back early this week in dedication to national puppy day! These two are forever my favorite pups! http://t.co/mDQxlROFYT
I just spend $50+ dollar on shoes I really didn't need 💔
Realizing how easy my Lab report for Nutritions is &amp; thinking I could have done this weeks ago. Procrastination at its best !
Sick as all hell but have so much school work to catch up on 😩
A Gatorade sounds real nice right about now.
Cousin brought home Buffalo Wild Wings.. Good food, good chats 🙌
I am getting sick &amp; I couldn't be more pissed off! Where's the emergen-c?!
I feel so bad but then again it's not my fault...
I'm pretty family oriented &amp; it means the world to me when my significant other can be close to mine &amp; me to his.
Ellie always comes lays on my chest when she hears me crying.. I am soo blessed with the greatest dog. Something I'll always thank him for.
Just spent forty minutes looking at puppy pictures from Ellie &amp; then of her &amp; Tootsie #timeflies 😪🐾💔
The boys at work spoil me.. #thankful
I've worked more hours already then I did last pay check haha. Guess you can say I'm never taking a week off work again 😅
The center pieces for my cousins wedding are so unique &amp; gorgeous!
Dreading today... 😓
Tired of waking up with headaches &amp; a sore back. This bed friggin sucks..
But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free..
The struggle of having to go pee but not wanting to get up 😫
I miss my boys already. 😕
Dr Pepper a day keeps the doctor away! My theory has been finally proven guys!
Anyone have an old cause &amp; effect paper I can have?!
What my mama sent me this morning❤️ it's like she knows when I need her encouragement. http://t.co/TWspsYcCx6
Kinda pissed off that I got stuck with working Sunday. I'd much rather go to Cali but then again I could really use the money. Uhh😩
Take me back to Germany. I'm long over due.
Omg if this puppy doesn't shut the hell up I'm putting its crate outside!
Can't believe I forgot about country dancing tonight 😫
Night time fun at the park. Pretty sure I've been to more than enough this week but it's def my new fav pass time💙💜 http://t.co/otAIRGtA4B
When your make up is on point &amp; you can't stop the tears from ruining it. 😔
Already over this. Can I go back to the weekend?!
I just wanna go on fun trips &amp; adventures
Back to reality I go 😭😭
It's like you purposely post certain things
Kinda annoying how you gotta post on everything after me. Like gtfo.. I'm beginning to hate you.
I feel sorry for my future husband.. http://t.co/NsJ6tYp2GB
I have so much shit I gotta save for &amp; bills just keep getting bigger &amp; bigger
Lil bit of family fun at the park 😊 http://t.co/VFyHsPv1U2
