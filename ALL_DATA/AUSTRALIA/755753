Latest episode of Dan Carlins @dccommonsense covers the TPP. A good listen (especially to get your friends unfamiliar with TPP to listen!)
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! I knew i should've stayed the fuck off the internet til i could get around to seeing the latest walking dead episode.
Sure it's got plot holes &amp; dumb bits, but the good makes up for it. Helps if you like Die Antwoord tho; practically a vanity piece for them.
Glad I went &amp; saw "Chappie". Saw brutally bad critical reviews &amp; nearly gave it a miss. But I absolutely fucking LOVED it! Great movie. YMMV
Anyway, back to regularly scheduled programming of how fucked this govt and data retention is. :-P
Like now that "relationship status" on Facebook has changed, it's now "official" heheh
But most people I see day to day already have known for weeks/months. :-/ just anniv day became the day to formally "announce" it I guess.
Separation has now been announced on Facebook. &amp; so begin the phonecalls/msgs from concerned friends. Prolly something to be thankful for.
So if the start of 2015 hadn't resulted in a bunch of stuff spontaneously falling apart... today would have been my 11th wedding anniversary
Bravo to that too-small a group of Senators who actually represented the Aussie people today. #dataretention #auspol http://t.co/8nbiERPomU

So tempted to play very inappropriate songs... how about some Doug Anthony All Stars... hmmmmmmmm
At work we now have a machine running Spotify &amp; we can all login remotely &amp; add music to a shared playlist to play in office. So tempted -&gt;
In a tight NSW election, optional preferences could win the day http://t.co/3S7TkMV4kq via @ConversationEDU #NSWVOTES Number em all people!
Im still mildly surprised the union mvmt hasnt put more pressure on the ALP leaders over #dataretention. Do they not understand it? @auspol
