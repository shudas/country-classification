Selena Gomez is forever a babe! She looks happy and comfortable about herself - what's it to you that's she has gained weight.

The relief to actually have an interview. I'm feel a lot less stressed about this whole working scenario.
My interview went great and they bought up big brother 😒 I can't escape ever.
Well I froze when I left the house for a little but made it to the bus stop. Never been more thankful for two random teens company.

Frankie hates la proof ok great bye. http://t.co/kFGpIEh3jz
My love moved to a city he hates, this is great career wise though.
I just realised that I've used keen in three different contexts in one conversation. Aussie's are actually that lazy 😂
fuck getting no sleep my left and an hour ago and I am already a mess. i refuse to be anxious.
i have just discovered @yunamusic - thanks for all the positive vibes on a day where they are running out quickly.
Frankie won't listen to your opinion regardless of what side you're on so ... Why bother
I just saw a genuine "are bill and Hilary Clinton married?" WOW.
Among other things. That will actually be the day.. I don't see it anytime soon, so that's fun.
Can you believe everyone is like WOOP Australia and were sitting here with conservative government who won't pass a marriage equality bill
