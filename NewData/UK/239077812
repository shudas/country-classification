#Election2015 #Tories #alanmabbutt Don't believe that this is an independent publication. http://t.co/f8EgM6MmsL
#Alanmabbutt  Alan Mabbutts dirty tricks campaign won't fool people. "You and your family" is desperate" negative literature.
#Election2015 #Alanmabbutt Why is Alan Mabbutt publishing disguised literature with information that even the IFS don't agree with?
#ELECTION2015 #Tories Tory dirty tricks department hits new low with "You and your family".Thinly disguised propaganda .
Don't be taken in.
#Election2015 #Tories
"You and your family" misleading and costly booklet bur really more Tory lies.
#Election2015 #Tories toriNow the Tories delivering disguised booklet "You &amp; your family". Just more propaganda .
#DavidLaws  Why would anyone listen to Laws or the Libdems after their support of the Tories and tuition fee lies?
#Election2015  The fabric of our society is being systematically dismantled and we are being persuaded to support those doing it! Madness.
##Election2015 #libdems  Absolutely no one trusts the Libdems after the tuition fee debacle.
#Election2015 This election is about more that politics. Its about fairness, justice and compassion. Not the values of greed and phoney care
#Election2015 Now Gove turns on Clegg.
Oh dear. Oh dear. What a shambles.
#Election2015 Gove near to tears on Newsnight. Not a single straight answer.
#newsnight  How good that Gove was dumped from education. Surely time for retirement.
#newsnight  The truth about selling off housing stock revealed for all to see.
Housing associations have charitable status. Gove struggling.
#ELECTION2015  BBC News at Ten.
"Attempted rebranding" Just about sums up Cameron and his champagne buddies.
#Election2015 "We are the party of working people"  I was waiting for Cameron to choke on his words.Maybe next time.
#ConservativeManifesto Seriously not to be believed. Where are the 12b cuts coming from to give us this good life.
Tories losing it badly.
#ELECTION2015 #conservative Its a good life for Cameron and his front bench of millionaires.Pity some of them can't even speak the truth
#conservative  Michael Fallon, Cameron, Michael Green should be ashamed of the way they have left the country.
#Election2015 Tories digging a bigger and bigger hole for themselves. Great.
#Election2015 Tories think the public are stupid. No good life for those lining up at food banks. No good life with 12b of welfare cuts!
