Cont @RockstarGames but after 3 attempts and no magnet each time it's clear this was a server/game issue. Also lost our challenge! So thanks
Dear @RockstarGames thanks for blowing my #GTAOnlineHeists by not providing the magnet on Eddy's chopper!  Thought t was my drivers fault..
Really odd too as I can hear the voice chat from the lobby, but the game will not load! #GTAVOnline @RockstarGames
Yikes @RockstarGames #GTAVOnline not wanting to load for me today! Things were great after the update, no go today! #gta #Withdrawls

In the end you only cheat yourself as you will never reach your full potential and will always sell yourself short. #StopCheating
Can't figure out why so many ppl cheat in life. Not matter what it is, a test, a baseball game etc, too lazy to do the real work maybe?
Dear @RockstarGames big fan of the #GTAVOnline but please do something about these "modders" who are ruining a great game. #StopCheating

PPL are so ignorant these days, buy new shoes, watch new movies, listen to new music , all distracting you from the real issues! #WakeUp
The fact that you go and tell stories to your friends about our issues just goes to show what kind of person you really are! #bitchplease
How hard is it to leave somebody alone? All you have to do is not speak to them right? If only things were that easy! #bitchplease

Dear @RockstarGames Xmas is over, please remove the snow from #GTAOnline it's the dumbest thing you have done yet. And it's pointless!

Add me on #psn "pheid_" and lets play some #gtavonline together! I've created two new water races, and one new air race. Join the fun!
Also if you are promoting tweets from other companies I will do the same. Stop trying to sell me shit, it never works!
If you or your company shows up as a #suggestion to follow I will deff not. In fact I will mute and block you! I know what I am looking for!
Makes me very, I was gonna say upset, but I feel more sad for the amount of ignorant ppl in the world. Educate and inform yourselves!

Anybody able to log into #psn yet or is @PlayStation on a break? All this drama had gotta be hurting their business... BIG TIME! #psndown
What the heck is going on with @PlayStation lately? Was down last night, then up agin till early this morning now down again? Why (cry face)
Alone on Xmas eve so I wanted to play some games and the #psn is down! I hope the ppl at @PlayStation are working on a solution!
