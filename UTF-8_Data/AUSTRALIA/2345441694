When I watch music video clips, it really emphasises how boring and lame and unexciting and uninspiring my life is. #ohwell.
Ugggghhhhhhhhhhh, I suppose I better get up. But not because I want to, but because I have a stupid appointment.
But seriously, those things are huge, Google them for yourself if you don't believe me.
Just opened up my google browser in public, last thing I left it on was Nick Jonas nipples. Woops, looks like I have some explaining to do.
Mondays are for shameless, and last man on earth,
Ugh, why 140 characters? Like you make me pick and choose what words I have to spell right, in order to bring it up to standard. Lame.
I. Am. So. Tired. 
Somebody feed me watermelon
