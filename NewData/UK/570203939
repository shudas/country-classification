Eg: Saturday. That Devitt was being a bit of a twat, give him some stick and he immediately assists a goal and is even more of a cunt to us
Also pisses me off that every single time we give the opposition stick in a game they score or win to make us look like idiots
I've seen enough over the last few years that I would not be surprised one bit
What are the odds on us appointing the wrong manager, Eastleigh coming up and beating us next season, and another year of failure?

I was going to tweet "are we losing yet?" I see that's been answered. Christ we are dreadful
Why is James Beattie 10-1 to become our new manager? That is literally never going to happen for endless reasons on both sides #scummer
Average of 0.8 points per game. Woeful
Over the last 4 years only QPR have a worse away record than us in the entire football league, and we've won the fewest away of anyone #shit
For 21 Jordan Spieth doesn't half look like a guy with 2 kids and has been holding down a corporate job for the last 15 years
Sean O'Driscoll would be my choice. Would he leave England u19 for us though?
Shame about awford but after suffering through 21 away games so far this season, it bloody had to happen
Just seen a couple of St Pauli fans in Manchester. Strange
