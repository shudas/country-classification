Right now I'm hopped up on 4 shots of espresso and I'm focused on a million things except for my psyc exam
The last thing I want to do is write this psyc exam. Bless the Lord for unconditional post-grad offers.
I should just accept my college offer already.
Caffeine withdrawal
K, I need some chocolate. There is literally none left in my house üò•
And that chapter of my life is complete
I swear Twigs street-style is straight outta the 80s movie Fame and I loooove it. I need to revisit that one.
Managed the salvage a lot of what I already wrote down too, which felt great üëå
Special thanks to @reflektors and @reddohm for getting me here without any tears ‚ú®
K guys I got this. Satisfied w/ thesis, and now 1500 words in. This will tots be complete by morning.
Ugh writers block UGH

Do I go get a coffee? I really want to... And this essay is just... Needing help
Time to finish my essay. There are more important things going on in my world right now ‚úåÔ∏è
Not involving myself anymore because I don't like the hashtag. Not gunna look up on it, not involving myself. It's a bad omen. Good day.
How did I get wrapped up in this? I'm not even a democrat or a republican. #redherring
Also, why is "I don't need feminism" a hashtag? It tried to pop-up on my last tweet when I was hash tagging and it ruined my morning.
Finishing undergrad w/late papers, allnighters, and discussions on sex and patriarchy. #idontwannaleave
Just registered for my QUAA card. *panics*
Writing my last essay of my undergrad on sex. I know @reflektors would be proud.
psyc prof just said "phrasing" (then because only like 3 people got excited she mentioned Archer).
Why can't I find the most recent Masterchef Canada episode anywhere? Help a sister out. I won't be able to focus on my hw until I get my fix
I want to keep this collection with me forever http://t.co/LM04v9Psve
When you find a new show to watch don't go on FB - sponsored links are terrible about spoiling things :(
Getting more "student recruitment" emails from a program which has yet to accept me. OR YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME MY ACCEPTANCE!
STOP TWEETING ABOUT RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET. I'm too poor for cable üôà
nvm not answering that.
She just made an announcement that the perfume use in this lecture gives her a headache. Which is hilarious cause I haven't showered since..
Updating on more similarities between myself and my psyc prof:
Maybe autocorrect is trying to tell me I should say it more often.
Wtf autocorrect changed my "charging" to "chagrin." How often do I say chagrin? Answer: never.

4 weeks left of my undergrad. I'm not ready for this, at all.
To @kayseymour @reflektors @JessicaIngramm @emeworkman @livvsabourin ...and the others w/out twitter ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/Ur5QlfgKGo
"I like cars - I like fast cars - but I don't like pickup trucks." THIS IS UNCANNY
She also just mentioned that she accidentally took a year off her age once at 22, because sometimes she just forgets. I'VE DONE THAT TOO
She also said, "When I grow up, I wanna be a cat." (Fact: second prof through university to say this. I love my degree.)
This prof is my kindred spirit. So far today, she has made an anecdote about when she used to play Mortal Kombat.
I'm slowly abandoning Apple (&amp; Virgin) but until my contract is up or I make a bunch of $$ it's agonizing how much I fiddle w/my iPhone.
But I am sick, just in case that wasn't clear. I sound so silly. Can't breathe, and my throat feels about as wide as a quarter.
Not skipping class this AM b/c I'm sick, but b/c I my laptop is dead and I'm too high-strung &amp; set in my ways to handwrite psyc notes
I love twitter.
Yo @SparkySweetsPhD I had to take to Sparknotes to review my summary of Jekyll and Hyde when I was hoping to get your perspective, Sir.
Watching The Pagemaster - so many emotions.

I feel like I'm still there when I look in pictures or read these posts. I want to go back to Chiang Mai more than anywhere in the world.
It's been almost 3 years since I went to Thailand, but I saw a post about an ele passing on and there's a couple tears on my cheeks.
I will be so thankful when I no longer have to study for psychology. Last minute memorizing is no fun.
Does someone want to bring me a bag of snacks from the grocery store to help me get through tonight?

When I don't get vaccinated it's because I'm lazy, but articles like this remind me of what I take for granted. #feelingguilty
So much irony today: go on twitter to see blow-up about the #antivaxprof and then see this article about Jake.
Ok, there's only 7 weeks left. Fire under ass has been lit.

Made progress on my college applications. I need to keep this momentum up for Sunday library day.
Had a productive night somehow. After I panicking over my schooling &amp; figuring that out, I visited w/ my sis, made dinner, cleaned, and
Revisiting Robin Williams' words is hard.
I mean, I always knew Kingston shopping was bad but HOLY, I did not get a single thing done today I set out to do. Super disappointed.
It's Friday night and I am baking a loaf of bread. üçûüëçüéâüçªüÜò
So I'm just gunna go back to reading instead.
I applied to college yesterday, Twitter. I'm growing up and I could hyperventilate if I think too hard about it...
I don't fly well and it sucks. I always always seem to get reflux flares. God help me today, and bring me some milk :(
A selfie is not a picture of you someone else took.
I'm really sick of people calling portraits selfies. I know it's not important, but a selfie is a pic of yourself that you take yourself
