Wish I could have seen @ThePandoraBoxx in London this evening! 😔
Who doesn't love a bit of old school Britney? 🙆🙅💁🙋🙆🙅💁🙋
This time next week I would have handed in my dissertation and finished university forever. It's going to be bitter sweet 😍💥💃
Never before have I fallen in love with an outfit as much as I have with this two piece  😭😍 http://t.co/qDYqsgCtuV
How is it already 4 o'clock and I've got nowhere with my work today 😤😖😫
One thing I have learnt at University is that I cannot spell to save my life. Thank you spellcheck! ✔️✒️
Want to stay in bed all day and sleep but I've got to drag myself to the library to do my diss. Cannot wait till it's done...
Who doesn't love Rachel Stevens, Jojo, Nathasha Bedingfield and Mama Mia soundtrack? 🌸💝🎈😍
My aunt sends me pictures of her dogs to show Will. What is happening to my life 😂 http://t.co/13CISjVQJn
12 days till my dissertation is due! 😫
Cannot believe I've only just discovered @RuPaulsDragRace!! Fallen inlove with @ThePandoraBoxx 😍
Groundbreaking  https://t.co/sLTiGM3os4
There is a guy in the library wearing football boots. What a dick..
I've become the type of person who type on my laptop in coffee shops. To be fair it is on campus. http://t.co/LM6DkzHlAs
Always wonder what music people are actually listening to. Bet people won't guess I'm listening to the #TheReturnOfTheKing soundtrack 😂
And now #LegendarySoundtracks! Bit of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Atonement and Narnia 😍
Listening to the Prisoner of Azkaban soundtrack to help me finish my dissertation. #embarrassing #imsuchageek #hedwigsthemethough ✨💫🌟💥
Up and going to the library already. Two week countdown till my dissertation is due 😫😰
I'm so jealous! They are so beautiful!  https://t.co/LmaM9Ctbn8
Heaven http://t.co/fJl7Hh6nVC
Back at uni. Already so bored that I want to cry. 😳
This jacket is the dream 😍 http://t.co/BHipkyzPP3
Spent all afternoon looking through #Zara and #Mango websites and crying about things I can't buy #studentlife 😭
Wish I could go to the Downton Abbey ball but at £500 a ticket I somehow don't think that it is a possibility! 😤😡
Had such a cute weekend in Dorset with the family 🐰🐥🌸 http://t.co/IFKdsmYrCF
Can't wait to go to Dorset tomorrow to visit family 🌸💐☀️
Only thing I hate about coming home is that I can only bring a certain amount of clothes back. Especially when I've bought back rubbish 👕👘👔👟
I feel ridiculously unwell today 💀😷😵
Want to go again desperately ✨🌟💫 http://t.co/g5nltOd1qv
Just got home for Easter. Watching #MidnightCowboy #JonVoight #DustinHoffman 🎥🎬
I've just done THE worst thing I could have done all day and got back into bed. I have no self control 👎💤😴
Deadline today and tomorrow and then home for a week 🙆🙅💁🙋🙆🙅💁🙋
Two days and I shall be home for a week of pure relaxation 🏠❤️😍
Today has been so unproductive I think I may cry. Especially with deadlines Thursday and Friday... 💀
Even visited Shakespeare's birthplace. Bonus! http://t.co/WQzqVmCroK
Thoroughly enjoyed the spontaneous trip to Stratford-Upon-Avon to see #TheJewofMalta at #TheRSCTheatre! Brilliant performance! 💥
Two deadlines this week and then only my Dissertation left before I'm done 📄🎓🎉
Trip to the Theatre later 🌸
So excited to go home next weekend for a week 🏠💛
I've watched an interesting variety of films today. Hercules, Zoolander and then The Hours. What a mixture.
If I didn't think my love for Meryl Streep could deepen anymore, I was wrong. I've just watched #TheHours. Amazing acting! #VirginiaWoolf
Really regretting doing my washing now. Don't want to get out of bed 💀
So proud of @UnMakingMemo!! No more splats, jumps and touches 😁
Today is the day. My last performance at University. #PhysicalTheatre #UnMakingMemories
I set my alarm to see the eclipse but I think I've missed it? 😂
Five weeks today till my dissertation is due in and I finish uni 😨😱😭😩 #panic #justwanttoeatloadsofcarbsandcry
Missing @AshleyJMills_ and @toribambori so much today. Can't wait till I'm home for good 😍😭😪
I need to see #TheHogwartsExpress ASAP. As soon as my dissertation is handed in I'm going! #WarnerBrosStudioTour
Eaten way too much pesto pasta in third year.
Happy this morning 😍🌸🌺🌻
How can it only be £1.80 for a half of Guinness aswell? So happy 🍺🍀
Spontaneity is so underrated. Pub followed by a bottle of wine at home with Lauren and Fio #StPaddysDay #Guinness 🍷🌸 http://t.co/0NlzDySpQC
How can a uni not have enough computers in the library? I want to work on my diss but there is nowhere I can do it! 😡😤
Roast Beef Sunday lunch followed by Lemon Drizzle cake and tons of tea. Being home is the best ever 🌸🍋🍰🍴☕️
Home for the weekend ☀️🌀🌸💛 http://t.co/9hn8NafR8W
Couldn't be happier. Not only did I get a free coffee earlier but I have finished writing my dissertation 💪😍☀️🌸🙈✨🌟💫
Only 200 words left and my dissertation is complete. Oh and then a month of redrafting 💀🔫
Hate that I'm short and would look ridiculous in this dress 😂 @millsmackintosh http://t.co/Uk4F4GBnDJ
The day I hand in my dissertation I'm consuming a whole tub of ben and jerry's and maybe a family sized bargain bucket.
Keep it positive!
http://t.co/WmRbS2RABY
So glad the cleaners felt compelled to make as much noise as possible this morning. The only day I get a lie in and I wake up at 8:30 😰
Don't want the next few months to happen at all!
It's Sunday and I haven't had a roast dinner. I'm very sad...
Just discovered Alfred Hitchcock was born in Essex! 😂
Just applied for my first internship for when I finish uni. Scary..
Had the best weekend possible with Will 😘
Got to 9000 words of my dissertation. Well deserved break over the weekend 💪
Fancy eating a whole LARGE tub of Cookie dough icecream
Exciting stuff ❤️ http://t.co/qlSoN65BHJ
Two days till I get to see Will. I'm so excited 😍🙊👫
One hundred words away from completely 9000 of my dissertation 😴💪
No motivation to do my dissertation today. But only 50 days left. #nearlythere #hurryup
Miu-Miu sunglasses are actually all I want in life
So excited to see Will this Friday and to spend the weekend in a positive environment 😍
The day my dissertation is handed in I'm going to watch so much awful TV
I cannot be bothered with people who try to bring so much negativity into my life. Go away..
Great...
Such a nice feeling to have done more work than you set yourself. In bed now watching #Cavalry been looking forward to this film for ages 😊
Hate being a poor student. Teasing myself by browsing through Zara's spring collection 💥
If you tell me you hate George Michael, you're lying
Searching through old photos @YasminJade @gracekingx 😂😂😂 http://t.co/Y7rIEzLEui
Feeling positive! 💪👏
The author of the book I'm currently reading is 'Gertrude Himmelfarb' what a marvellous name 😂
Could just lie in bed all day watching old episodes of Spongebob Squarepants
56 days left before my dissertation is due in and I finish university forever #Icanseethelight
😘😘😘😘 http://t.co/e3QvnEnboh
Today is just not happening
Crazy that I've done 6000 words already.
Am I the biggest child or what? http://t.co/TmPSC0VIEY
It wouldn't be the Oscars if #JohnTravolta didn't do something strange.
Don't understand some girls. They say they can't go out of the house without makeup on but will happily look orange and patchy. Makes sense.
Now I can sleep... 💤💤💤💤
I AM CRYING!! YES EDDIE REDMAYNE WON THE OSCAR!!!!! 😍😍😍🏆🏆 so happy!!!
Cannot wait to finish uni
I keep following people by accident. I must look like such a creep 🙈
Oscars tonight ✨🎥
So incredibly bored in the flat by myself. Wishing so bad that I was at home right now.
https://t.co/qR19sCv4Ha      😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 @willgoldhawk I found the vine and I'm never not going to watch it
Haven't been this much of a good mood in so long 😁
Oscars weekend gets me so excited! Want Eddie Redmayne to win so so much!
So excited for the #Oscars2015 tomorrow night! ✨
Everyone follow @PrinseClothing!
Only 65 days left to go. Cannot wait! So done with uni it's beyond a joke now... 😒😤
Just ordered Indian with Lauren. Best treat after a busy day 🍴🍛😍
The amount I am craving a sausage roll right now is incredible! 🍴
😍😍😍😍😍 http://t.co/aVrFah8him
Already want to go back home and I've only been at uni for 9 hours. 😰
No energy, ever!
#Maleficent was a complete letdown. What an awful, awful film!
Last film is #Maleficent ✨
Next is #FiddlerOnTheRoof #OscarWinners
Going to watch an endless amount of movies today. First is Kramer vs. Kramer  #DustinHoffman #MerylStreep
Watching #Rainman for the first time.#DustinHoffman is outstanding. What an incredible performance! Love that Sky has old oscar winners!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ http://t.co/5GPjPIGZc6
Want my hair to be this colour again! http://t.co/HDoWw6oKjX
Been wanting to cut my hair off for so long. Can't wait till I'm no longer a poor student ✂️🙈
I'm so confused, I thought that she had 101 puppies, not only 16? What? My childhood is ruined!
Dalmatian Puppies are just too cute and I want to cry 🙈😍🐶
Watching #101Dalmations and cringing at the thought that I used to think that it was actually possible for a dog to have that many puppies 🙈
Amber Rose's argument with Khloe Kardashian is hilarious!
Spending Valentines with my two favourite men. Will and my Grandad 😘😘
Always forget how much I love Vampire Weekend 😍
Just got an email confirming the date of Graduation. Cannot wait!
Really excited to go to the Theatre tonight with the Physical Theatre group!
Craving tea and toast with tons of jam 🍓
Missing this one masses today @willgoldhawk 💛 http://t.co/4XzXfB47VP
Slightly fallen inlove with @FrancisBoulle after watching MIC
So done
When all your hard work doesn't pay off you start to question what is the point.
Miles Teller should have won Rising Star award simply for his role in Whiplash. Jack only won because people knew him from Skins. #overrated
Really cannot wait till next weekend so I can see Will 😍😘
#TheGrandBudapestHotel is definitely set for the Oscars! I'm crossing all fingers and toes!
