#ellivetweetsatthedoctor
I learned today that I can see better out of my left eye than I can my right
there's also nothing like realizing you're even more scared of the doctor than you already are and your mom isn't here to calm you down
nothing like being asked to do a vision test and getting nervous because you forgot your glasses and misreading a line you can see
nothing like sitting in the student health center with a swollen eye and looking like i havent slept in days
I'm pretty sure I was bitten by a bug under my eye and now I have a black eye and it looks like I got into a fight
29 more days until I leave for jazzfest 😎😏
hello i am running on less than an hour of sleep
it's 2:07 am and I'm still doing work that I started at 9 pm for a 1 credit course, and im nowhere near done.

the best thing about college is that every day is pajama day if you want it to be
apparently what we're doing in chem 1 is o chem material I did not sign up for this
when you're in chem and your TA tells you he didn't learn what you're learning until he was in o chem #pittprobs
