***Seeing you is like chewing on tin foil; an aweful feeling and a dumb idea **** #getout #canyoumoveplease
Had a great day off! Helped a friend paint, had homemade cordon bleu and spent some time with great friends!
My god. Nothing like a glass of wine and #1g5g @PhilipTetro facial expressions are to die for!

Twitter is the only place I just dont give a fuck. You dobt want to hear it. Dont follow. #dhaf #thisisme #real
If someone could go ahead and bake me a homemade cake. And than bring me one.. that would be great.
I hope ya'll do well... but really.. Mcrae and Amanda wont last in the real world... a realter and a pizza boy..... winning.. #BB15
Chilling out after work. Going to watch some well deserved big brother in peace and quiet. My gosh I love PVR
Your just a child in grown up skin
some of these birds out my window sound like they are a mix between a dying crow and a rooster. Shuttt  Uppppp
The only reason to look back is to remember where you came from.
Fuck the haters, and the people that will hold you down. Raise your damn head and go forward.
I need to quit dwelling on what I don't like.
spoiled ppl make me mad. Mostly because I have busted my ass for everything I own. But in the end, I know what's up. This is my shit bitch.
please tell me more how you got all these new things.. when you barely have a job. Don't lie when your mommy and daddy got them for you.
It's not in fate that your life will start looking better. Its when you choose to look at your life in a better light.
This is going to be a long day.
Working at the taste of Edmonton. Come to the #CDNbrewhouse tent and say hi. Oh and consume a large amount of booze  :) See you there
#SummerBucketList to have a summer romance that someone  would write  a book about.
Some people are just so frustrating. Really wishing I just lived alone!!
Scorpions are like spiders with knives.
he spoke words that would melt in your hands
Nothing beats a country road, country tunes blaring as loud as they can go and a rodeo in the distance. Good lord its good to be home.
nothing keeps me awake more than a song with banjos in it. lone ranger road trip
Derp
I understand I'm being dramatic but my feelings are hurt. I never let thing get to me like this.
Congrats, you got to me.
Flaunting a new girl infront of my face, "oh I didn't know you worked here" bullshit you jerk. Our last date I told you I worked here
Supposed to wake up on 4 hours and 53 minutes. So glad I'm tired. Hah. #sleeplessnights #insomnia #nosleep
Anyone have any ideas of someone to follow that is interesting, funny or plain ol entertaining to follow?? #whotofollow #followwho
Just unfollowed over 100 people on twitter. Sorry I was bored of your tweets. It wasn't you... It was your tweets...
#sadbreakup
Please post more on social media how you do drugs and are a badass. Being a bad bitch will get you so far.
Watching clueless Britney Murphy you are missed
If you hold me like you never want to let go, like I would be the first thing you would ever miss.. I would promise to do the same.
Starting my new job at The Canadian Brewhouse downtown Edmonton. Wish me luck!
I'm just in love with love, and the idea of something binding us together
Feeling truly blessed. I have two legs and a heartbeat, the sun is shining bright and I have some pretty fantastic people in my life. üëå‚òÄüôè
I hate that you have forgotten me already. You made a promise and you've up and left me.
I cannot sleep due to this heat. Ugh. So tired but this is making me feel nauseous.
So sleepy. But time to get moving!
We can calm our crazy with tea and shopping. So my wardrobe is fantastic.. üòç
Or am I?
I'm kidding
Well I quit.
My boss told me that whatever I told him, he would believe it. Not because I can act but because im a girl..And I tend to act dramatic.
Please ask me why I'm mad. I'm sure that won't make me more mad.. @TheGirICode
I fucking love snap chat. Said every girl with a phone.. Ever! #selfiesnotselfies #snapchatlove

I'm so excited for monday. One day off my real birthday but still celebrating it then!!
Tempted to buy a twin size bed and get an extended closet.. #singlegirlproblems #ugh #needmorespace #myroomishugedoe
I find it uncomfortable when I know what size of bed people sleep In. You are one person you don't need a king size bed. I'm wierd...
Going to the pride parade tomorrow to see my friend in the parade. Can't wait! ‚ò∫
Hives all over my neck. Wow I feel pretty
Wow my birthday is in 4 days.. Why do I feel so much older than I am. üòí
This the small excitement of my life.. Good lord I'm boring
Haven't worn a bra all day. And I do not intend to. Fuck the authorities ‚úå
I am so so soooooo sick of busting my ass and getting paid nothing. Fuck this.
Well I have officially been up for 20 hours. Sleep well everyone!!
Can't believe my birthday is in 8 days. Fuhhhhhck
Also it's the city in me that I'm stoked there is cell service. Yay for local-ish campgrounds
So glad I made it for camping with the fam. Nothing better than falling asleep to the sound of rain on the camper roof.
Successfully surprised my mum! She almost started crying. She didn't know I was coming home this weekend.
So tired. I do not want to drive 4 hours
