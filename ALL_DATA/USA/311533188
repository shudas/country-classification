I wish I had more friends like me... None of my closest friends have kids. I'm in this ship alone 😒😐
I need another pair , so far I just have some work pants.
Bought my first pair of maternity pants today. Up until today I actually thought they looked old fashion but they soooo comfy on my stomach😊

I know what I need to do and what's best I just hoped for the slightest change.. You never truly get what you want .
I just a want piece of mind.
I wish I could be as free as you. But life has forced me to see the bigger picture; envying what you have will only make me bitter....
I'm ready for change. And that's what I'll get!
#OffWork
Getting the carpet cleaned this weekend. And definitely going to be out looking for bargains.
Class, Doctors appointment, then class again... Least I have things to do to keep me/mind occupied.
