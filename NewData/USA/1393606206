All along by kid Cudi says it all
But all the ups and downs will soon be worth it
Go head and switch the style up and if they hate then let em hate just watch the money pile up
Got yay by the beanbag
Quote my ass on this and put it in the history books, if you vote for Hillary Clinton you are fucking RETARDED
MUSCLE RELAXERS ON DECK
I can't fucking stand this kid
My goal in life is to beat the fuck out of someone with a chain with a master lock attached to the end
Running a mile isn't fucking weightlifting there's no fucking reason it should fucking be part of a fucking weightlifting class
Play it back from the top if you recognize real
Lmao you never stop learning new shit about weed
don't know if i'm feeling school today
Or as George Bush would call it, Nukuler
You're out of your God damn mind if you think I'm gonna answer 70 act questions that belong in front of a fucking third grader
KONY 2015
It feels like every hour is like an hour long
People are so fucking dumb about germs, YOU NEED GERMS IN CONTACT WITH YOU OR YOULL GET SICK ITS CALLED IMMUNITY
There is no place for me
Mark my words: I'm going to Kendrick Lamar's wedding
What the actual fuck
I've got some issues that nobody can see
MY BEST SONG YET? https://t.co/byHc5fNTsR
Beam me up
let the champagne splash let that man get cash let that man get past
Today is the motherfuckin day
He just watches
everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
