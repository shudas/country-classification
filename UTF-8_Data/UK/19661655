Ewan has turned his nose up at scampi - very odd considering his love of fish, Granny Joan would NOT be impressed!
Today, I have learnt that if a deal looks too good to be true, I really fancied the new biomass boiler, turns out I just can't afford it :(

Starting to get fed at the prospect of another night without power :( I know @hydroPD are working hard, just hard work now
Think I better put things on charge in case the power goes out with the storm
Wow, silent migraine, that was weird, who knew!
Funny how it's takes you ages to get the Christmas decorations up and only half an hour to get them away!
Not looking forward to taking all my glass to the recycling - so much I'm going to look like a right old drunk (and most of it is jars)
Does anyone know what time the stuff at the northern meeting park is happening today?
It really hurts dropping a frozen tub of soup on your toe, did it hours ago and it's still durling :(

YES! I am really looking forward to my trip to @EdenCourt tonight to hear @NicolaSturgeon :)
Lost my debit card, still have my purse, it's cancelled but the deep joy of waiting for a new one to arrive :(
I appear to be growing my own Hallowe'en costume this year, the pluke forming on the end of my nose is truly frightening
Ewan woke up with a hilarious scarey nightmare, apparently Dr kawashimas floaty head from brain training floated through his bedroom door!

Jeepers, that was some wind a nd rain last night, I don't usually hear it through the night
Just saw Dave has a programme coming on later called "why planes crash" isn't the answer because they stop flying?
Love the autumn colours, makes me think of my mam. Her birthday was 31 Oct and when she was little she thought the colours were done for her
Planned electricity outage in Culbo on Tuesday 28th October - looks like homework by candlelight that night!

Watching @bbcqt and wondering where the @theSNP person on the panel is, then I remember that #indyref is over &amp; all the talk is tory now :(
Helicopter just gone over the house for the third time in 10 mins, wonder what's going on
So proud of Callum, he knows all his letters &amp; is so good at reading - &amp; it's not even the tattie holidays yet! P1 is going so fast already
You know the country has problems when the news headlines are:
1 - Tory defects to UKIP
2 - war in Iraq
3 - George clooney is getting wed
:(

Watching Westminster parliament discuss military assistance to #Iraq leaves me with such a heavy heart, wish we were not going to b involved
