Less than 24 hours till @Pebble shows us something really cool about #PebbleTime. I guess its the expansion port addons that are possible.
I'm giddy. @Pebble favourited my tweet to @Pebble about #PebbleTime and I got the notice on my @Pebble #CircleofLife http://t.co/chy9fW2ULN
Hey @Pebble, for the stretch goals you should think of something like a mic or a color screen for #PebbleTime. Those would be a game changer
WARNING, FOUL LANGUAGE TWEET. Can I get "Fuck iWatch" on my special engraving on my #PebbleTime . That would be great, thanks
We need a external speaker addon for the #PebbleTime so it can be a true Dick Tracy gizmo
Remember when going to a friends house always to bring dinner (even if you have to kill it on the side of the road) #WalkingDead
Hey @Pebble Can you get someone to have #PebbleTime to activate Tasker on a voice command. #beammeup
I stepped on her finger. http://t.co/B4WCjBrIoP
