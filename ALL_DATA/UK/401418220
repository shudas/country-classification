Editing all afternoon aw yessssssss ✌️
We just watched Pride 

Oh my god everyone needs to watch this film
The Electric Ballroom is such a nice venue though ✌️
Electric Ballroom is being used in this film we're watching in college and I just had a flashback of wonderful memories hit me with ugh 💕
I mean I was never big around the waist/belly area anyway but y'know I got this vision in my mind and I'm aiming for it 💪
I mean I am still a little way away from the somewhat flatter stomach I am aiming for but like yeah I feel more comfortable even now
I think I've lost a little weight 🙊
I'm so tired and I have a sore throat ✋
Exhausted 🙈
I didn't just fall off my chair what are you talking about
"You've literally just seen me with a mouth full of biscuit"

#NowPlaying ♫ Party By Myself – Hollywood Undead http://t.co/3GBdL5G8ru
I'm in the club, I'ma party like a war child 🎶

I'm getting drunk, yeah I party like a war child 🎶
Editing is going good and bad at the same time because the video itself flows well but right now the audio seems so super awkward...
You're all wonderful people ~ 🙊💕
I am so tired 😖
I woke up and instantly thought "oh it's okay I can just close my eyes and go back to seek for a few hours" but no I can't because college
Though I didn't do anything physically draining today I feel so tired from all the laughing &amp; smiling but damn got some good work done ✌️
Viewing evidence of wonderful memories make me smile ~
Good isit 😎👌
My brain's gone from GTA V to crackers to college to Breaking Bad to crackers again to Netflix then back to GTA V in the space of 5 seconds
Wait I have college tomorrow 

Oh my god
Ugh GTA V on PC or not 

This is going to be a long ass debate in my head until I eventually give in and actually go buy it
Yo bitch
I've got one heck of a sore throat today ✋
I'm still not over the fact I finished Breaking Bad
Jesse 👌 http://t.co/89suGu3NiM
Then again, I only know of two people who have ever blocked me and I'm not really sure it's worth snooping on their tweets really
Also it's handy having a multitude of Twitter accounts because I am able to snoop on the tweets of the ones who block me so that's fun
😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
Breaking Bad took my heart and shot it to pieces with a machine gun
Just... wow
I just finished Breaking Bad

I am an emotional wreck
Do not steal. 

No matter what you are stealing, you are being completely inconsiderate to another person therefore doing wrong. 

Do not.
This is my new favourite thing http://t.co/LY9SLvEjhp
Is there point me getting GTA V on PC? 😐
this is the most full a train has been for me
OH MY GOD THE TRAIN I AM ON WAS DELAYED 20 MINS NOW IT IS ABSOLUTELY PACKED FULL HOLY CRAP
So many trains getting cancelled like dayum ✋
Finally my train home is moving. These delays are crazy...
Just sent @LadyDarkKnight off on the train to London, super gutted this weekend has gone so quick! See you again close to the summer girl! 👌
Hahahahahaa

Humans
People who make up rumours and lies about those who are known as famous by the public are people that need to just not like please like wow
True story but look at how atrocious I used to type ✋ http://t.co/6c95O1Dro0 http://t.co/Y7dfRsgap9

@rocketqueened
Fo' lyfe 😂👌 http://t.co/nHjayZ6uak
Ugh 😂👌
I fear I may have spent almost £50 last night... 🙈
I think I may have given my number out to a Russian guy that I could not understand one little bit oh mannnnnnn
So basically @LadyDarkKnight and I got given 2 roses each by some guys like yeah and ugh what a good night this has been like woah dayum 😏👌
I have collected @LadyDarkKnight! 🎉
Waiting for @LadyDarkKnight to arrive 🙊🎉
I still don't get how from my town to Cardiff on the train can be £6.80 return yet a long near hour trip to Barry Island is £5 return ✋
Pryzm tonight is it 👌
Pre-mark ✋
I can't believe it's almost over...
The last two episodes that I did watch of Breaking Bad just seemed to ruin my emotions in a whole lot of ways like holy crap man
Two more episodes left of Breaking Bad then I'm finished
My heart is breaking over this last season of Breaking Bad
oi @rocketqueened http://t.co/BEnVAKmNUY
This photo is amazing 😂 http://t.co/af9kG7KYcH
"I don't think you heard my joke because you didn't laugh"
Holy crap https://t.co/XFFO7gfbNj
Woke up later than intended... 🙊
I have written a few dreams in my phone notes though...
Sometimes I wish I kept a dream diary
Last night I had a mad dream that I can't quite remember the details of but I know it was strangely dramatic and lots of friends were in it
You know I sometimes wonder what specific dreams at night could mean, like whether they hold an underlying reason for existing and all
I do not understand those of you who call band members "mommy" or "daddy"
Ayeeee this weekend is gonna be stunnin' 🎉
Such an amazing time down Barry Island, fair play like! ☀️ http://t.co/gS2TMpZ0E5
Pass through Cardiff on the way to Barry Island and EVERYONE at the stand gets on the train, this thing is packed full now holy crap
Whenever Wales sees a bit of sun you can almost guarantee a large portion of us will end up at either Porthcawl or Barry Island 💁
I do believe today is a beach day 😎🎉 http://t.co/wH1OmSWHjU
Ugh look at all the alcohol 🎉 http://t.co/ZLxYqlGzg7
Heading to Barry Island tomorrow 😎🎉
I feel so wiped out today 🙊🎉
Was a great night mind fair play like 👌
Also I ended up finding one of my friends before I left, thought I would update on that, let him know I was leaving for home like DAYUM
Home 💕
Thank you for tolerating my drunken slurring 🙊 @rocketqueened
Oh well talk of cheese and boobs and alcohol won tonight 👌
Ugh idek if my friends are still here 😂😂
