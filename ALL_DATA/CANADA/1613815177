Should I be insulted that twitter keeps sending me university &amp; student related ads when I'm 45?
Kind of getting fed up with "sexy ladies". Way to go, Internet. You have broken me.
The trick to good art is to accidentally spill white paint all over it.

I know, pollution, money, sweat shops -- SOME DAY YOU WILL BE DEAD.
Some day you'll be dead. Some day you'll be dead. Some day you'll be dead. Some day you'll be dead.
OH MY GOD WHY DO WE BOTHER DOING ANYTHING
My dog cannot make the logical connection between eating rotten cat turds off the ground, &amp; having diarrhoea for the next 3 days.
Realized in therapy today that I hate selling and self-promotion. I just want to paint and write.
Going to start selling paintings on my website. 4 small paintings are up for grabs now. http://t.co/wY6cO52SA7

My radio station would have hourly updates on innovations in witchcraft.
CBC Radio: lots of talk about hockey. Zero talk about criminal mug shots, outsider art, fucked up books, witchcraft, etc. FIX IT NOW.
When the local hockey team makes the playoffs, they never interview people who hate hockey &amp; want "our" team to lose so people shut up.
My flu is over, more or less. I am going back to work after taking 3 sick days. I expect to be dead by 10 AM.
If it's not imaginary, I don't want to hear about it. Keep reality off my dinner plate. Okay, thanks, goodbye.

Come back when you drink out of a real severed dick.
If you feel stupid, just remember there are elected politicians who believe the bible is real &amp; that the rapture is going to happen soon.
Kind of looking forward to murdering an innocent to bring about the rise of Satan &amp; his army. #MondayMorning
Jesus had 40 days in the desert. I have the flu. When I return, I will be equally as amazing as Jesus, if not even better than that hippie.
If you are in your 90s, &amp; you post a personal ad online, you are amazing. http://t.co/QVuNDNNTBa

WILD MUSHROOMS FOREVER
Born w fists clenched.
Punch doctor and mother
In stupid faces.
Flee hospital for woods out back.
Eat nothing but wild mushrooms forever.
Why would a cough syrup be both a cough suppressant &amp; an expectorant? Now it's all loose &amp; ready to cough up, but I'm not coughing? What?
Kind of in love with Christine Wicker now, thanks to her book "Lily Dale". Have tracked down 2 more books. (1st person religion journalism)
We are all Oz. And it's up to each of us to decide if that means that fake wizard or that HBO prison show.
ROYAL BABY: What you need to know about the next royal birth. NOTHING. YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AT ALL.
Paz de la Huerta (Nurse, Boardwalk Empire) is a "skilled artist" according to her IMDb page. I cannot find any of her art online.
I watched exactly 6 minutes of "Let's Be Cops" on Netflix before I decided to blow up the earth.
I can tell you're alive by the way you can't stop crying.
I can tell my flu is going away because anxiety is returning along with a desire to eat everything in the fridge.
The thunderstorm frightened my dog the same way choice frightens me. We hid under the blanket together, shaking, panting.
Have you ever escaped a conversation by pretending to pass out?
In gout we trust.
SOME DAY I WILL RETIRE &amp; HAVE A LIFE
*retires*

I haven't died, per se. I've merely become an employed member of society. Let us discuss our pension plans for 3 hours while sipping wine.
Michael Valenti's story about the explosion was mostly about going out for a smoke. Don't smoke, kids. There might be an explosion.
