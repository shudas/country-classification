Getting ready for closing statements soon. Winner tricky to call #bathdecides
Steve Bradley's BBA side coming out there #bathdecides
'Green Crap' - the logo of the Tory manifesto is a green tree! #bathdecides
Can we please move onto a topic where there is a bit of disagreement? #bathdecides
Back to climate change we go... #bathdecides
FACT CHECK - UKIP supporting a 30,000 limit #bathdecides https://t.co/0OlgRrHS2m
So far we've learnt: Labour have amnesia, Lorraine has sass &amp; Ollie was 13 when the recession started #BathDecides
Lorraine's sass there was admirable #bathdecides
I'll give Steve some credit there - 'collective amnesia' has quite a good ring #bathdecides
SHOTS ARE BEING FIRED #bathdecides
Highest tax rate under Labour was 40p from 1997-2009 #bathdecides
The return of the beige blazer #bathdecides
No mention of a reduction of tuition fees on UKIPs manifesto yday? #bathdecides
Hypocrisy again from @UKLabour - they talk the talk, but then do the opposite in private http://t.co/67CUm2rIBw #GE2015
The Dubai Snapchat story has just really made me want to go there...now ðŸ˜ª
The moment I've been waiting for has arrived! I hope Americans elect @HillaryClinton their first female President in #2016 #Hillary2016
I'd say an announcement in 10 mins.. https://t.co/StDSxBBQhX
Not long now! Excited for #HillarysBigAnnouncement
An avalanche of negative leaflets from @bradley_steve &amp; @bathnesld - can we l keep it positive? @ben4bath #bath http://t.co/bSgcAX8vzv
A bit misleading @bradley_steve, eh?! Considering you were a councillor in London until last year.. #Bath @bathnesld http://t.co/7204s19QqO
QPR fans abuse on the sidelines, during throw-is &amp; corners was a disgrace - that's what gives football a bad name #CFC #chelseavqpr #Chelsea
I love it when we beat QPR. Such a scummy little club. Hopefully they'll now get relegated #Chelsea #CFC
This is the worst I've ever seen Ivanovic play in a Chelsea shirt #CFC #Chelsea
Started the day by making the front page of the @guardian website.. Not too bad! #Hillary2016 #Ready @ReadyForHillary http://t.co/KCcrO323dG
Current Tory campaign is too narrow, too negative, lacks passion &amp; suffering from a deficit of big, attractive policy announcements #GE2015
The Conservatives need to be more positive &amp; unveil bigger policies which appeal to people, i.e. make them want to vote Conservative #GE2015
Nothing like travelling on a weed-filled tube carriage at Midnight #London
Rand Paul taking on 'Washington'...despite the fact that he is a US Senator himself. Hypocritical much? #RandPaul
Tony Blair coming out and criticising the @Conservatives #EU referendum pledge will probably increase the appetite for a referendum #GE2015
Already looking forward to Season 4, glad to see @netflix wasted no time in commissioning its release for early 2016 #Underwood2016
Just finished watching @HouseofCards Season 3, and ironically I think my admiration of Frank actually increased somehow.. Great finale
So the 7-way debate was interesting &amp; enjoyable, BUT will it actually change many people's voting intentions? I'm doubtful #leadersdebate
Peter Hitchens doing a great job of being a mouthpiece for the Labour Party tonight #bbcqt
According to Hitchens, the Greens, SNP &amp; Plaid Cymru are 'establishment parties'...really?! #bbcqt
'Frankenstein government' - gotta love Michael Gove #bbcqt
Had Salmond been there instead of Sturgeon I doubt the SNP would have won the debate  #leadersdebate
Loving the @SkyNews #spinroom analysis post-debate #leadersdebate
Why is everyone talking up the '3 woman leaders who shook up the debate' - only Nicola Sturgeon did!! Bennett was woeful #leadersdebate
New YouGov poll released tomorrow shows the @Conservatives on 37% - more than their vote share in 2010 #GE2010 #leadersdebate
Miliband did not come across as competent at all; choice for PM between him and David Cameron -&gt; Cameron the clear winner #leadersdebate
Nicola Sturgeon winning the debate in a snap poll - bad news for Labour in Scotland #leadersdebate
Woeful performance there by Natalie Bennett. David Cameron came across as the most Prime Ministerial #leadersdebate
Good job DC exposing Labour's zero-hours hypocrisy #leadersdebate
Someone pick up that moron and throw her out the door #leadersdebate
Cleggy's rent-to-buy scheme doesn't sound like a half-bad idea #leadersdebate
THANK YOU NICK CLEGG FOR EXPOSING MILIBAND #leadersdebate
Someone please ask Ed Miliband why immigration went up by millions under Labour #leadersdebate
Unnecessary low blow there from Farage on HIV #leadersdebates
Awkward as Labour started the privatisation of the NHS. Well done for Clegg speaking the truth   #leadersdebates
I forgot Natalie Bennett was on the panel #leadersdebate
David Cameron rebutting strongly there #leadersdebate
Nigel Farage probably coming out on top so far #leadersdebate
Patronising Cleggy out again tonight #leadersdebate
Let's go! #leadersdebate http://t.co/gk4AIsIjnR
Looking forward to tonight's #leadersdebate - hopefully it will be informative, not just 90 mins of mud-slinging &amp; political point scoring
Research shows that over 70 #Labour MPs, and a large no. of Labour councils, employ lots of people on zero hours contracts. Hypocrisy, eh?!
I didn't realise that 20% of something constituted as an 'epidemic'. #Labour misleading the public and not being truthful again #GE2015
First time in history that the North-West is growing faster than London though #BathandBeyond15
I think that Britain's standing in the world decreased more with the launch of the Iraq War which Labour took us into #BathandBeyond15
Chairwoman Bergaust kicking off the Ethical &amp; Political Conference 2015! #bathandbeyond15 http://t.co/9uzXithXdy
It's important that this election is decided by policies, not personalities. Character assassination is not nice, whatever party #GE2015
#Miliband confirming again that he has zero credibility on the economy #BattleforNo10
Awkward line of questioning there from Kay Burley #BattleForNumber10
**FACT CHECK** The Pupil Premium was ALSO a Tory Policy - Steve trying to claim full credit there http://t.co/kCGLJyQpt1 #bathdecides
Please tell me someone is actually going to ask him about the tuition fees decision #BathDecides
If Steve gets elected , let's hope he goes nowhere near the Foreign Office #BathDecides
Lots of waffle here to avoid answering the question directly  #BathDecides
7/12 down... #bathdecides http://t.co/lzAXTawL4l
Steve giving a reading from scripture #bathdecides http://t.co/EHNlLw25PF
Hustings bingo is underway #bathdecides http://t.co/6mYwXmhe1o
#Bercow should resign anyway - the #Speaker is meant to command the respect of entire house - he clearly does not command such a respect
Let's try and ensure the new speaker also goes back to wearing the traditional Speaker's garments too - this is the House of Commons #Bercow
Political engineering at its best. Hopefully the motion will be passed #BercowOut  http://t.co/15oIjCAWTy
Yes!! Let's get rid of him http://t.co/SQbrlCa0iB
Good performance by the PM at #PMQs today - good to rule out #VAT rise, and highlighting Labour's economic incompetence #GE2015
However, at present, it's clear that @David_Cameron is the best man for the job #Cameron #GE2015
Although I must admit, the prospect of Theresa May becoming @Conservatives Leader is a reassuring &amp; fantastic one #GE2015
Good on the #PM for being honest - unlike the days of New #Labour where squabbling &amp; leadership whispers were rife #Cameron #GE2015

Big family dinner for the sister's 11th - I missed out! :( see you all in a week! @Sofia_DiPaola http://t.co/UoWkN7oovt
The truth about Zero hours contracts: 80% of current jobs are full-time; a majority of people on zero-hours like them because of flexibility
Ben's not on my wing of the Tory Party, but there's nothing wrong with pragmatism #BathDecides
At least if he doesn't win he'll get a job working at the Job Centre #bathdecides
Strong start there. Touching on issues students care about. Honesty also helps  #bathdecides
World record: most number of times 'establishment' has been said in a 30 secs period #bathdecides
What are the panel's views on the cap on benefits of Â£26,000 per year? #bathdecides
Sniping going on here between the Green and Labour candidates re the living wage #bathdecides
