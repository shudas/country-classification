Thanks for the chat @MorningGlorySEN @RachLynch27. Good luck in your semi and everything beyond @Hockeyroos
Michael Clarke to skipper the @StarsBBL. Announcement expected tomorrow morning. Big news for @BigBashLeague
Just hoping someone from Bertocci's marketing department read that  https://t.co/GEvH9Zl5Jl
Give us a call. We'll fling you a Bertocci  https://t.co/aTTl5oqELS
Owen Wright jags an epic 10 on a ripping barrel at #MargaretRiverPro @wsl. Just perfection.
This didn't end well for Bede Durbidge @wsl #MargaretRiver http://t.co/T2LmnLvJjM
Did I read that right? Did Steph Curry really make 77 straight 3-pointers at training today? That's SEVENTY SEVEN!!!! Straight! @warriors
Seriously, this is faaaarking incredible #MargaretRiverPro @wsl
You wanna see what courage looks like? Flick over to @wsl on 503 on FoxSports. Margaret River off its chops.
Should've had you do the top 5. Barry Round!!!! https://t.co/p633lsMFlc

Keen to know the thoughts of those who watched the Dank interview on Sky. Are you any clearer after that?
No documents  https://t.co/Vw6S2i2vCX
'True' getting a little giddy-up too  https://t.co/vge6DlgI4G
Why wouldn't he. #Spieth #masters2015

Morning @BrentonSpeed. Joe Allen scored. It's a beautiful day.
I get that.  https://t.co/wsoQanBis9
#Tiger popping his bone back in . . . Over to you @arozenbachs and @pcalleja1

He is close to securing my vote Harmsy. In times of great despair, it helps to know that others share the pain #read https://t.co/swp1WRwn7r
Imagine his moves 48 hours later!  https://t.co/GkNp2AUCcS
Outstanding get by you. Agree on all fronts, outstanding film.  https://t.co/HIEKrgvsAL
Something for fans of @stkildafc, @EssendonFC and @Mummy_41 on @MorningGlorySEN tomorrow. See you at 6.
Why? http://t.co/cxfPNDY9Kw
It might be called #FridayFrontBar but no reason you can't catch up with it on a Sunday if you haven't already

St Andrew has declared that Top 10 in up-and-downs since the Birth Of Man. #Spieth #masters2015
Extraordinary. Just magnificent. Oh my hat. #Spieth #masters2015
How are the nerves on this shot? #Spieth #masters2015
Is Phil threatening to make tomorrow just a little bit interesting? #masters2015
Can our studio hosts at least pretend they're having a good time
That might have been the worst putt we've ever seen from #Tiger. Leaves it 5 feet SHORT from 25 feet. Horrific.
That looked pretty familiar #Tiger #Masters2015
You're not helping  https://t.co/5FAYHEnKNe
Disgraceful lack of intensity and competitiveness by Gold Coast. Talent alone ain't getting it done. Saints absolutely humiliating them
Spot on @kjack_15. Umpires should be able to identify when a player lays or drops into what would be a legitimate tackle. Don't pay it.
Thank God.
Has there ever been a more beautiful double play.
#BOSvsNYY
6-5. Red Sox. Game is now into its 3rd day. Just concede already @Yankees. #BOSvsNYY
Any chance Mookie might lay bat on ball for a change instead of swinging like a dunny door again #BOSvsNYY
Xander The Unstoppable #BOSvsNYY
This is fair dinkum unbelievable #BOSvsNYY
Odds on run being scored on wild pitch?
Second longest game (for time) in Yankees history. Middle of the 18th. It's 1.35am in the morning. Red Sox lead 5-4. It must end now. Surely
Never in doubt #BOSvsNYY
Got a bad feeling about this #BOSvsNYY
I love knuckleballers.
And I really hate knuckleballers.
#BOSvsNYY
Big Papi finds a way. God love him #BOSvsNYY #RedSoxNation
Come on @AntonioMurdaca1. Nail 18 young fella #AUSgusta
That'll just about do you Ben. #Masters2015
I suspect this has really thrown Rory.

Ollie Goss in 2014, let's get @AntonioMurdaca1 over the line as low amateur this year @TheMasters. In a tie now, -1 for his round #AUSgusta
Phenomenal. He's 21 years old. Making a lot of great players look very average.

"Players don't want to come here." Malthouse in his press conference. How far the joint has fallen. And how much work there is to be done
As uncompetitive as any Carlton side I've ever seen. Major indictment on team leaders. No sugar coating this. #AFLEaglesBlues
Carlton supporters in need of some light relief. Maybe give this a run around after the game

Credit to you Levi Casboult.
Any chance we might make Josh Kennedy actually earn one
Thanks mate.  https://t.co/4MLWMKkwaE
Its impressive mate. Very high-end stuff. Who benches more though - you or Drakeford?  https://t.co/TD41UPdg4O
Thanks Ash. Hopefully someone watches it.  https://t.co/oUt2BPwfp0
Do you think he knew what he meant to so many of us? I truly hope so. #ValeRichie 

http://t.co/kXQ0l5lYcF
Hey @FitzySA. Any of these young fellas having a crack any chance of making it anywhere?

http://t.co/OdFw1sturP
Thanks big fella  https://t.co/xU4YcxKTGI
For those who think that we're all taking the game a little too seriously, this might be for you.

http://t.co/snt5RMasPZ
The best thing about going to sleep tonight? The @TheMasters is on when we wake up. #AUSgusta
It's not just @westernbulldogs fans who like @BobMurphy02. Tune in and no matter your allegiance you'll love the man
https://t.co/NvKMp1Yxoe
James Hird joining us @MorningGlorySEN tomorrow out of the 7am news. #Hird @EssendonFC
Producers of @BigBashLeague coverage must keep @MarkHoward03 @bowlologist and Jason Dunstall separated lest it becomes a @HawthornFC love in
Congrats @meglanning7. #Wisden
Let's hope we have plenty of reasons to. And plenty of #AUSgusta @PGAofAustralia  https://t.co/YgtiDANtIK
Golf junkies get sillier and go more troppo about the @TheMasters than fans of any other sport and their pinnacle events #MeaCulpa #discuss
Young Hogan from the Dees and Carlton's Thomas. Is it just me or is there something there? http://t.co/1rn1ngEPz9
Yet again @AndrewGaze10 makes our moment with the @premierleague trophy all about himself! #SelfieMania http://t.co/z4RRZEJnW4
Yep. I'm a sucker. Love it.  https://t.co/pvIvzPEmRn
Hello Hanley and welcome #RedSoxNation #GrandSlam
You can't stop them from scoring.
And it's near impossible to out score them.
Can't lockdown.
Shootout not on.
How do you beat @HawthornFC?
What a simple joy it is to watch Shaun Burgoyne play footy @HawthornFC #AFLHawksCats
Whack a bit of Sweet Georgia Brown on the lead up to that Jed Anderson goal and it wouldn't have been out of place
Is it the Chicken or the Egg?
Was Paul Puopolo this good before he arrived at Hawthorn?
Loads out of this game to discuss tomorrow @MorningGlorySEN. Paul Roos to join us @melbournefc fans as well as the great @andrewbogut
Not Steve Johnson's finest moment. Poke this bear at your peril I suspect
Well then. That didn't take long. #Hawthorn #Good #VeryGood
Are we racing in Sydney today @rtralphy @TheSharkTweet @JaseRicho?
