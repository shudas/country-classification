Best case scenario for Oilers fans is for either the Flames or Canucks to sweep the series.  #LesserOf2Evils
Where are all the "World Hockey Championship" playoff preview shows? #Oilers
Gotta have personality/charisma to make @Twitch enjoyable to watch.  @RealKidPoker will obviously be a home run broadcaster.
.@BradJohnston10 @iam_fam we'd better start producing before they think we are the #WorstFreeAgentsEver #BallHockey
MacT might actually be learning. Under promise and over deliver.
Looking for a new series the wife and I can watch together and she said "How about that Crown of Thorns everyone raves about."

Just when i got used to Monday nights being awesome @BetterCallSaul had to finish for the season. #NowWhat
Nice troll job by .@BestBuyCanada in this weeks flyer. #RIPfutureShop .@FutureShop http://t.co/dbZEcPxlxY
So happy Yakupov signed for a reasonable amount and right away.  Really thought it might get ugly.   Glad it didn't! #oilers
That's actually pretty sweet thanks @RealKidPoker! (Or whomever signs his name) http://t.co/bQ5kc0vsA2
Pulled groin a couple of weeks ago in ball hockey and got a game tonight. Really hope it holds together.
Just once I'd like to see a politician knock on our door when it's not an election. They only show up when they need us. #abvote #ableg
MacT got it right with Pouliot really like what he brings.  On the other hand Teddy Purcell is the softest player in the world.
29 goals for Iggy this year.  Really hoped he hit 30 but still Mr.Reliable
I'm going with the Winnipeg Jets vs the Washington Capitals in the finals with the Caps winning Lord Stanley. #StanleyCupPlayoffs

Congrats @Senators just an insane run and I hope you keep it rolling in the playoffs! #allaboard #sens
If the Penguins miss the playoffs this year they should replace the gm and coach.  With Ray Shero and Dan Bylsma. #HadItLostIt
Gonna be so amazing if Arcobello ends up with more goals than Perron this year.  Right @SportsnetSpec!
The David Perron factor ladies and gentlemen. #byebyebye
The Flames or Canucks are going to the second round of the NHL playoffs guaranteed.   http://t.co/WDo80E3Pr0
Flames will miss the playoffs next year anyways. #FoolsGold
Crazy the Penguins are either two wins away from a 100 point season or two losses away from missing the playoffs.  #ThinMargins
Hate the @NHLFlames but respect what they've accomplished.  When Giordano went down I thought they'd make a late push for the lottery. #oops
Go @FlaPanthers pleaseeeeeeeeee hold
How bad do the Bruins need Tyler Seguin right about now #TheFunkSoulBrother #NHL

Really like @PokerStars sponsoring Jaimie Staples. His stream is so engaging &amp; he has the ability to bring new players to the tables. #claps
Go @Senators go! #GetItDone make some #SadPenguins bring your #EhGame http://t.co/cXneu1IY2w
Hate to admit it but Better Call Saul finale was a huge letdown.  Wife fell asleep during it so I didn't get a piece after either. #thanks
Why is there always an election in Alberta?
Props to .@HillaryClinton for the longest revenge plan of all time.
So when .@HillaryClinton wins &amp; gets in the oval office her first order of business will be to hire a handsome young intern. #right

Me with Halen and Hudson up in the tree. http://t.co/Ve8v1W0RV4
Hiller shouldn't get a shut out for that lol.
Yes the Jets won now it's gonna be awesome when the @EdmontonOilers win tonight. #NoPlayoffsForFlames
A bit lost on where to shop for electronics now that Future Shop was put to sleep.
David Perron stats with Oilers this year:
