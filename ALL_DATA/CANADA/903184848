Only 51 days until summer ☀️👙🙌
If it's meant to be, it will be. #waiting
I've got everything I need, and nothing that I don't 😊
When you find matching socks you know it's gonna be a good day. #littlethings
It might take a year, it might take a day, but what's meant to be will always find it's way. #wishfulthinking

Sent my boy @owen_barons21 off to Calrgary for a week! 😊 Wishing him and the rest of the AAA stars the best of luck at the Mac's! ⚫️
Exactly one month until christmas 🎄😊 #excited
Oh so thankful. I love my life. #blessed
Never stop showing someone how much they mean to you 💘
Life becomes easier when you learn to accept apologies you never got 👈
Blondes may have more fun, but brunettes do it better 💇 #change
The less you care the happier you'll be✌️
Here comes the weekend #mayloooong 😊
Can today just be over already? #butactually
Stop swimming across oceans for people that won't jump in puddles for you. 👌
Nothing better than a weekend of volleyball 💜 #saskcup
