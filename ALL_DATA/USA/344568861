It just feels like I've read so much more in The Goldfinch than I actually have. http://t.co/nO1WXgCrZj
I never got into Star Wars or Star Trek. I've seen both, and if I had to pick one, I'd choose Galaxy Quest.
Bought Songs of Innocence and of Experience for a class I dropped. Forgot about it. Maybe after The Goldfinch. http://t.co/yXEQF4Ryzc
I'm sitting at work craving chicken so hard right now.
I really wanna go to the @miracle_monocle reading tonight at UofL, but I have to work. üò¢
I'd just like to point out that following people just to get followers and then unfollowing them is stupid and I disapprove of the practice

My newest blog post on my personal blog. I'd say it's about the books I've been reading, but I'd be lying. http://t.co/buWmfrqFhi
The Goldfinch, Daredevil, and As I Lay¬†Dying http://t.co/LZZJZlQhbQ
Coffee. Makes. Me. Happy. http://t.co/vDQ23onioF
I edited short stories all weekend instead of reading "As I Lay Dying" for my American Lit class. Paying for it now. http://t.co/8uSISGajzk
Pretend I've not read Joyce Carol Oates's "Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?" yet so I don't look like too big of an ass in class.
Hillary Clinton eats at Chipotle and now it's trending because we're all fat.
I don't like to make promises about how frequently I post on my blog, but it tends to be about once a week. #FYI
Thank you, Scott! üòä https://t.co/pFi0ivsKgg
As I Lay Dying is probably the most confusing story I've ever read in my entire life. http://t.co/bqVdaHonOB
Everyone's gone at the office, time to whip out the smelly Italian Hero sub I acquired earlier today. **pulls it out of jacket**

It doesn't seem like it'd take forever to get to the end of this block, but it takes that and a day.
Why is 12PM usually when my blog gets the most hits? Do you people eat? Should I lure you in with tacos?
Meh, what's one more rewrite? Draft number? I lost count. #shortstory #writingtips http://t.co/i04PUaNqZj

Challenge accepted, butthead. YOU WILL LOVE ME
Sorry professor, I can't come to class today. I have a bad case of the end of the semester fuck its.
I'm just an overgrown college guy trying to get an editor somewhere to like one of my stories enough to hit the button.

I swear if I ever get an ad click I'm going to use real sugar in my coffee.
**wakes up** **coughs** **dies** Spring is truly awful. I wish I smoked, then this would all make sense.
I write fiction, rewrite fiction, submit my fiction, and get rejection letters from literary journals for my fiction. My new About page.
My neighbor's doorbell rings; he says "who is it?" Someone mumbles. "Who is it?" This happens all day, every. single. day. #fiction
I can't decide if I should continue The Goldfinch, take that communications quiz, or watch another episode of Daredevil.
Yeah my cat just ate a piece of lettuce like it was a slice of ham. Does that mean I'm starving her or what?
He- he brought- he brought me tacos! üòç http://t.co/QaJ3605K0C

My newest blog post. Read it and love me! It's about, um, literature! http://t.co/5nFQCeCxTg
Finally starting episode 2 of #Daredevil
My goodness that was stressful. No more editing my theme live on my blog.
Lost a lot of the pictures on blog. Whoops! I'll restore gradually over time. The prose is what matters, which is restored.
Okay, content saved. Layout a mess. Will fix later.
Yeah um my website broke.
Always remember while naming your children, a title is supposed to do work for the piece.
I'm glad the chapters in The Goldfinch are short or I'd never be able to get through them. I'm lost in the language, in a good way.
The third blog post from my blog about reading the Norton book is revised and rewritten. http://t.co/yry1ukpgs0 Read it and love me!
