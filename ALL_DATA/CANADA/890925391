Hey, @TheRealCGL, give @onthelinksgolf a follow for Peterborough &amp; the Kawarthas golf news &amp; info.
It's been a lifetime since I lived &amp; breathed basketball, but watching an NCAA Championship game still gets the competitive juices flowing.
Found out today that my awesome 2-yr-old nephew says I live in 'Peterbutter'. #socute
It really irks me when people use an apostrophe to show plurality instead of possession. #petpeeve
Twitter needs a "thumbs-down" button.
I got a letter from the government the other day...

Pleasantly surprised to wake up this morning to a follow from @MrChuckD. Can't adequately put into words how much of an influence he's been.
My boy is back living in Ptbo &amp; is back attending the same school he left almost 2 yrs. ago to the day. All is right in my world once again.
