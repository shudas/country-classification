I don't think you understand how excited I am for Season 2 of Girl Meets World. I'm not sorry for my excitement.
Don't mind me, just watching the new Star Wars trailer 5 billion times. #OHMYWORD
I finally started to listen to @levithepoet's Correspondence (A Fiction). Goodness. Very brilliant. Almost brought tears into my eyes.
I know I should be doing laundry, but I'm making a blog instead. #sorrymom
I just can't wait to blare out Jump5 during camp at SnowBird. #BlaringSomeClassics #SWO15
My to do list keeps growing &amp; growing but I know I'm just going to take naps.

The fact that I slept all day yesterday, I'm still tired this morning.
Today involves: sleeping, drinking way too much sprite &amp; phone calls with my best friends. Life is so sweet to me. #hashtagblessed

Of course they would change our departure again. WE HAVE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT. LET. US. GO. HOME.
NO WORRIES. I FOUND HER. PRAISE.
YOU GUYS I LOST LAURA. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE SHE WENT. #HELP #ILOSTMYBUDDY
Fuel gage is broke, the pilot worked over 13 hours. I haven't been this miserable &amp; so sad in the longest time. I just need to be home.
I'm about to burst into tears. I WANT TO GO HOME PLEASE.
I just want to go home. I just want to go home.
Please pray for us to be able to come home safely! Thanks!
UPDATE: we landed in Omaha, Nebraska because the KC airport had electrical error/bad storm. We're waiting to see is it okay to fly back.
Ugh now I have to go to the bathroom &amp; we are about to board on. WILL THIS DAY END?
UPDATE: the plane is here &amp; is being refueled &amp; what not. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. PRAISE. THE. LORD. #HollyAndLauraVsFlorida
#LauraIsDaBest
...I definitely knew that God gave me that opportunity &amp; I literally pounced it like a cat. God is so cool you guys.
...it's so cool to see her beaming with the love of Jesus out of her &amp; she's the sweetest! Like she is the coolest mom ever...
..and seriously on the plane ride to Florida, I got to share my life story &amp; gospel to her and she got to share her story...
So cool fact: a woman I met at the ATL airport was going to KC also so we stuck together bc of the whole different departure for Florida..
Now the plane doesn't departure until 10:15 aka I'm stuck at Orlando. #LordClearTheDangStorm
I JUST WANT GO HOME. I DON'T WANT TO BE AT ORLANDO FOR 35 MORE MINUTES UGH. http://t.co/zRb3lm8mQU
Also shoutout to @miss_meals for being the bestest person in the whole world by picking me up &amp; taking me to the airport. ‚ù§Ô∏è #SheRULES
I know I'm tweeting so much, but my heart is seriously overjoyed by this weekend. GAH. God is so cool. #SWO15
I'm so stoked to be with teenagers &amp; be crazy with them &amp; proclaim the Gospel to them. It's going to be the sweetest summer. #SWO15
I never felt more welcomed &amp; safe in this community. I'm constantly surrounded by encouragement &amp; laughter &amp; it's just so comforting. #SWO15
This weekend was absolutely incredible! So so so so blessed to meet everyone &amp; already create beautiful friendships!
And now we wait. #4Weeks #SWO15

Gosh Georgia is too cool.
Finally landed in Milwaukee &amp; I feel like barfing. #ThatLandWasTheWorst #Ugh
And apparently I cannot do grammar while I panic. #NCBound
I was on the wrong gate, I has too much coffee, I don't get a window seat &amp; I need a nap. #NCBound
This is the third time I've worn overalls when I'm traveling. I'm not ashamed that I look like I'm 12. #ItsSoComfy #NC

That moment when you thought you're done with packing but probably want to repack again just to be safe.
Gosh God is so cool.
GIVE ALL STRUGGLES TO GOD. He'll not only provide but gives you the peace in the mind &amp; know that you do NOT  need worry about it!!
My mom made a cake &amp; I got a bonus from my job. Praise God Whom All Blessings Flow.üé∂ ‚ù§Ô∏è
You guys. Today has been so wonderful.

"I leave for NC in two days &amp; I haven't packed" an autobiography by me
Especially when I'm traveling so much this weekend.
It's comforting &amp; nice to have friends tell you to have a good weekend, you know?
"Okay I'll stop eating Easter candy." 
*eats more Easter candy because I can't lie to myself anymore*
of course.
I don't remember my dreams but it usually involves either Jesus, being in the mountains, eating cheesecake or winning a dance battle.
I'm still here.
The weekend needs to be here right now please.
My store had all of the Easter candy discounted &amp; I had a tummy ache all day. It was so worth it though.
DANCING HARDCORE http://t.co/AdCqJnrhxw
Ok I publicly apologize to @clebdemps for not telling him about @twentyonepilots new song/music video. IN MY DEFENSE I JUST FOUND OUT SO SHH
They keep becoming more brilliant. This new album is going to make me dance, cry &amp; smile so big. @twentyonepilots #ComeOnMay #blurryface
My Jesus is victorious. My Jesus has conquered the wickedness.
*starts to awkwardly dance to Ok Go*
At first I was like, these are absolutely hideous but then I tried them on for the first time &amp; I said to myself "I'm such a fool."
I'm wearing my aunt's old shoes tomorrow for Easter and tbh they are actually cute.
You know you're parents are party animals, when they play Johnny Cash super loud on a Saturday night.
You know it's almost Easter, when your mother watches at least a couple Easter movies from the Hallmark channel.
One plane ticket down, two more plane tickets &amp; one train ticket to go. #TravelingIsInMyVeins

That really awkward moment when you thought you work from 9:30-5 but you actually work from 9-3:30. Can I go hit myself with a frying pan?

Mm whatcha sayüé∂ http://t.co/2UM153XnSD
So much paperwork to do but all I want to do is lay down.
I haven't unpacked from last week but it's kind of pointless to unpack because I have to pack again for next week &amp; two weeks after that.
Traveling is so much fun though please try it.
Me: gosh I have so much to do.
Laziness: no you don't. go lay down.
Me: k
Laziness: lol üòè
Excuse me, @AustinSscott be prepared this summer because I challenge you to a dance battle.
