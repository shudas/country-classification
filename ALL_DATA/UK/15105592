So, the 'major blaze' in #bicestervillage turned out to be not so major, just a part of a restaurant - talk about building one's hopes up.

Lord, give strength to those who want to profess their faith but feel hindered by others or their own hesitation. Let us be loud and proud!
#bbcradio4 #patrickmoore play: truly bloody amazing, a masterpiece.
#tomhollander as #patrickmoore : uncanny, hilarious... And moving.
Used to love #topgear specials. Watched a bit of one this evening and it seemed sadly irrelevant in the same way, say, a cd Walkman does.
1980s charity shop boom box got today. £3.50. Surprisingly good sound. #boombox #bargain #1980s #retro http://t.co/xisuo8E7rJ
#clarkson gone - perhaps Top Gear can now get someone who actually lives in the 21st century.
Goodness... Is Gordon going to stay the night? #mrselfridge

#howdidigethere on #radio4 ... Brilliant! Could have sworn it was #sallyphillips .
Revisiting #nicjones #penguineggs .Still fab. Nostalgic - including melodion far too loud, just as I remember it...
#restorationman - another place not finished. Like listening dutifully all through a shaggy dog story and the punchline's missing.

#wolfhall I don't think I'm intellectual enough for something so understated. Will cope better when we hopefully get an execution or two.
Can get agressive response when daring to suggest #charliehebdo was out of line. Kind of misses the idea of free speech. #jenesuispascharlie
Lights, emotional crowds holding devotional emblems, vigils... There is little to distinguish #charliehebdo from other religions.

#christmasmeans staying awake for midnight mass way after my bedtime - lashings of caffeine and James Bond doing the trick.

9 yr old accidentally kills instructor at a joint called 'Bullets and Burgers' ... With a name like that, any further comment superfluous.
