Ed Milliband right to call out Davod Cameron! Have the debate!!! #BigDebate #BBCDebates
Me!!!!!! https://t.co/LITU9JRkj6
Sturgeon is bae #GE2015 #bbbcdebate http://t.co/ssgF1hOpsn
Farage hahahhaahahha
This debate is really just a wet blanket compared to the last one #BBCDebates
Farage..... Blames immigrants. Fill in the middle bit #BBCDebate
Hey @SNPOut got a new image to help you win those critical votes in former labour heartlands #usethis #VoteSNP http://t.co/BUaLhO32Od
Hey #SNPout you know what a good idea would be? Start your own political party.... #loonies #zoomers #closettories #realtories
Biggest examples of hypocritical politicians? Go!!! #hypocrites #GE2015. The socialist Lord wins it for me @GeorgeFoulkes #labour #Scotland
So if you are a tactical voting Labourite - u would vote Tory, weakening millibands chance to be PM? The opposite of what you wan!? #SNPout
Would it also make more sense to tactically vote 4 @theSNP if you were a labour voter in SNP Tory marginal? SNP Support milliband = Lab Gov
Fair enough you don't like @theSNP - but abandoning all of your political values and voting Tory? #GE15 #SNPout
Tactical voting: vote for A cause you hate C. Why on earth would any labour centre left vote Tory to keep out SNP?! #madness #GE15
Everyone in Ross Skye Lochaber respects everything Charles has done, but I think we need a fresh face in Westminster @IBlackfordSkye
Disappointed to see Charles Kennedy team is now relying on the tactical voting #SNPout campaign and untrue slurs against @IBlackfordSkye
Most over used phrase of the #GE2015 already "BUT WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM" #aghhhhhhhhh #annoyingme
SNP on 52% in latest poll. @JimForScotland resigned yet? #UKLabour #branchoffice
My favourite "SNP BADDDDDD" article this week. Brief summary: SNP responsible for injured dog #GE2015 #SNP #pish http://t.co/C6qW8qEDav
Tories really are at their lowest now. Trident is an OBSCENE waste of money. £3 Billion a year to run a weapons system which is obsolete!
Honestly some people are so paranoid. Apparently without Trident we would be on the brink of being invaded!! #trident http://t.co/JEVww87OQx
Someone point out to him that this is not a good thing #ukip  https://t.co/5jhg5hyBJQ
#ScotDebates would be a lot more fun if each leader had to finish at least 5 Jager bombs beforehand.... #votejager
My #ScotDebates leadership debate marks out of 10! Take a read. https://t.co/k00CRzdHvp #Sturgeon #murphy
There we go @NicolaSturgeon I knew you would not let me down!!!  Donation to the @theSNP on the way #leadersdebate
Sounds like we are set for a Screaming Match tonight #ScotDebates
Breaking news from #ScotDebates @DavidCoburnUKip has answered a question and had not mentioned "foreigners" #gasp #noway #cantbetrue
In fact, completely abolishing the House of Lords would be #1 ambition if I was an MP!
I can honestly say that my one goal in politics would be making sure that @JimForScotland never gets to take a seat in the House of Lords..
Scotland's most recently famous racist claims that the SNP are "incestous" #wat #howdidyougetelected  https://t.co/XCnDxNgeaV
Donating towards the party which calls out @DavidCoburnUKip first on his racist slurs 2nyt. @NicolaSturgeon @patrickharvie @RuthDavidsonMSP
If there is anything more incompetent than a Prime Minister Miliband, it is most definitely a Chancellor Balls #labourproblems
Are the UKIP losing their bottle? Defecting to Labour or back to the tories. The UKIP vote could decide the #GE2015 http://t.co/fGIV7qVvcE
Also missing the #ScotDebates tonight because I'm at a football match. As I said last time @NicolaSturgeon will win! #ScotDebates #GE2015
Well guys look at it this way we may be "abusive cybernats" but the Daily Mail hates us. That means we must be doing something right?
Remember when they said all we care about is independence, it seems all they care about is #SNPout #tories #labour http://t.co/O157ggR7JG
Ross Skye and Lochaber.. If you can think of one get then you deserve to be MP #constituencysongs
http://t.co/cbceBFE4H3               Bruce Anderson here with possibly the most ridiculous article on Scotland I have ever had to read
Followed quite a few scottish conservative candidates for the #GE15, you know because they need some hope #poortorys
Even some labour MP's are questioning legitimacy of the #nikileaks and the part civil service played in it.....  https://t.co/ouBAAhuccY
Happy to say that my former Tory voting brother in law will be voting @theSNP after @NicolaSturgeon performance at #leadersdebate!!! #Snp15
So Sir Jeremy Heywood has another altercation with the @theSNP. Is this another case of "special circumstance" 2 protect the United Kingdom?
Michael Gove: "I would rather Scots voted Labour than SNP" #bbcqt #SNP #FrenchGate #nikileaks #GE15 http://t.co/5dxaB6p2BA
If Ed Milliband does indeed back what has been said in @TelePolitics #FrenchGate, ironically, it damages his credibility to be PM #GE15
The @TelePolitics has now given @NicolaSturgeon outrageous amounts of publicity. When people listen to Nicola, the more votes @theSNP wins..
It shows u how far @scottishlabour have fallen. Relying on 4th hand accounts of a conversation reported in the Torygraph 2 try and smear FM
Miliband as PM reliant on @theSNP support is the best situation we in Scotland can hope for. Not perfect - but the best option #VoteSNP
It's funny really - the better @theSNP do the more likely Miliband will be PM. Lab have to hold on in England however http://t.co/BC5rZQ5gnc
Daily Mail seems to have its hands over its eyes and shouting "THE DEBATE DIDINT HAPPEN SNP STILL BAD SNP" today.  http://t.co/UZU5rXy3P4”
The question that has definitely been answered tonight is  @AlexSalmond + @NicolaSturgeon Yoda Skywalker relationship has paid off big time!
If the@ScotNational front page tomorrow is not that @NicolaSturgeon "TELT" photo I will be disappointed #snp
And best picture of the night goes to!!!! @NicolaSturgeon #bbcqt #leadersdebate http://t.co/Z2Z57T7TYX
Question Time once again goes @theSNP mad... What are they scared off? #ProgressiveAlliance
We are shit at football and rugby, but at least we have politics!!!! @NicolaSturgeon #StrongerForScotand #sturgeonwinner
Remember the right wing press cry of fear of the @theSNP? What on earth are they going to say now? .... #leadersdebate
I really do hope that #SNPout watched the debate tonight. How you guys feeling? #sturgeonwinner #VoteSNP
Also well done @LeanneWood fantastic contribution to tonight #ProgressiveAlliance
1000 new SNP members during the #leadersdebate welcome in!!!! #SNP #StrongerForScotand
Never doubted her @NicolaSturgeon fantastic performance #StrongerForScotand #leadersdebate #TeamSturgeon
If farage wins this debate I will move to Uzbekistan... #leadersdebate
Winner winner @NicolaSturgeon #TeamSturgeon #leadersdebate
THERES A SHOUTER
