Hey if any of you have Dubsmash go ahead and text me the ones you make because they make me laugh a lot
Stay humble
Hey what's up hello
Why are people trying to prank call me are we in 5th grade again
Text me
My plans never follow through and it's the most annoying thing ever
I want to go on a hike with my friends :(
I hate the hospital
Who's up still
On the bright side I made a pretty good grilled cheese sandwich
I wanna give you the world
Having a best friend 10x better looking than you really sucks
I love french fries
Cancer sucks
The only thing I hate about portland is getting my fucking lighters jacked
I don't have feelings anymore
Cats communicate in weird frequency screams
I am a slut, I will 100% admit that
If you're a hoe

Does the phrase we don't love them hoes apply to yourself?
Emotional boys 4 life
My throat hurts but only in one spot wtf
Yo so I guess Miley Cyrus as a kid played in Big Fish, totally didn't even realize it till now
Goodnight you fucking shit heads
I'm fucking frustrated and annoyed now, time to get off Twitter and ignore my phone
I'm sorry for whatever I did
The more I see people upset the more miserable I remember I am
I don't fucking miss california or my family one bit
Guilty and jealous by design, all of a sudden I'm alive
True Life: girls only like me when they're drunk, or they live far
Quit being all weird on me
See you at the crossroads

As a lifetime Atheist, this CNN documentary on Atheists makes me fucking nervous. The whole point of my beliefs is I don't have any!
Starting by re-editing a thing I wrote months ago with the help of @A_CUDI88 re: playing nice with others at the local strip club. Out soon!
I've decided to be semi-poor for a bit and focus on writing and building models while I get healthy. Not gonna rush into sales again.
If your ex is dating a stripper I say good for him! And good for you too. You must be quite a lot of woman to have interested him.
In spite of everything, I love my life right now. A little love goes a long way. I'll probably feel different when I'm out of drugs...
Protection from the thunder storm. Barking helps. #dogs https://t.co/7xHv5n2gUd
Nothing like getting dropped off at the strip club by my mother like it's piano lessons or a play date.
My mother has finally concluded that since I'm feeling so shitty, I need a trip to @casadiablo to improve my mood.
You better be totally fucking awesome if I'm going to put up with your constant dropping off the face of the earth. Few make that cut.
Elderly people be complaining about kids always on their phones but they're the ones with their volume deafening a whole waiting room.
Both dogs are guarding me like I'm dying. Too bad they can't put those noses to work and go sniff me out some drugzzz.
Flashback Friday! The time my pug used a special limited edition white rabbit vibrator as a chew toy and I discovered it flopping about.
Should I just brazenly be like "I need 245 5 MG oxy to go, and three 1 MG shots of Dilaudid since I'm here, please, &amp; A side of phenergan"?
I'm really glad I get to waste some poor ER Doc's time and resources this weekend going in for drugs because my other docs dropped the ball.
It would be delightful to have a reason to smile before I fall asleep. Drugs just make me frown.
