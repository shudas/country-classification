Cameron made a huge mistake not showing up tonight. Ed is taking full advantage #BBCDebate
Ed Miliband is 300x better tonight
HAHAHAH shit. I just realised Nick Clegg isn't here.
Well done Nigel, attacking the electorate is definitely an election winner.
Nicola swiftly dodged that question on her FFA bomb she dropped last week.
Leanne Wood is doing a lot better tonight.
I think its outrageous that Cameron didn't show up to this debate. £145,000 a year for Christ sake, at least pretend you're doing your job.
Why is there 4G in Alness and not Inverness is the question you should be asking.
Just saw Danny Alexander talking in Inverness and not a sole acknowledging him. Felt quite bad actually.
😁😁
People that wear minion t-shirts probably have 10 dead cats under their bed.
https://t.co/c5szdegczA Everyone needs to watch this.
So rude and unthoughtful. 😳
Wish we did it for our international issue in modern studies.
I had no idea of how extreme Russia was in its divide in politics.
My sister got heelys for a late birthday present today and I really wish I was her
I haven't slept in 39 hours so I had a cup of black coffee at work earlier to keep me awake and now I can't get to sleep. 😃😃
It is snowing in Lairg and I am going camping tonight 😃
So far, maybe it just takes a bit of getting used to
No offence but series 3 of skins is waaay shit compared to season 1 and 2
People that think they're wild after they've turned 18 when in reality they're sad asf. 😂
Buzzing for my first day off tomorrow
Ew it was him. Why is he allowed on this debate if Clarkson was sacked?
Jim has done very well tonight
Bit ironic of Nicola to be ridiculing that UKIP guy for repeating the nationalistic approach.
Nicola loves undermining the other parties instead of answering the questions.
Why is this UKIP guy even here? May as well just have dead air. Nobody's listening.
Will probably be missed more than I will.
The biggest thing to come of me leaving is that my mum will notice that stuff doesn't get done before she comes home.
Cracking your phone has to be one of the most soul destroying things out there.
Been completely skint ever since I started taking driving seriously. Now I remember why I put off starting. 😔
Can't remember the last time the family went to Inverness (with me)
People using this fake story written as Tory propaganda are morons. Making SNP opposition look spiteful and demeaning honest campaigning.
Who's it about, that's the question everyone is asking ? @Joannemac20 http://t.co/uK6fHlcTSX
Jim Murphy should have represented Labour in the debate.
I became very fond of Nicola before the referendum and I think I am starting to like her again idk.
SNP proposals combined with Labour policies would provide a much more collectivist government than any other coalition would.
A lot of SNP policies are very appealing bar a few, and Nicola is a very determined, well spoken politician, unlike Ed.
Would be better than the current anyway
A Labour/SNP coalition wouldn't be a terrible thing. Would ensure a strong socialist Scottish party being represented at Westminster.
"I'm not interested in what you're interested in. Only what I'm interested in is allowed to be tweeted about"
What a Muppet
Cameron changes his mind on UK's position in EU every time he is asked #leadersdebate
Think there's an echo on here 👀
Ed Miliband looks like a 14 year old doing their access 3 drama exam. #leadersdebate
Clegg's speaking won't save him this year. Lost his support when he dropped everything to jump into bed with the Tories. #leadersdebate
Scaremongering is such an overused word in politics.
Nicola is saying stuff and just not backing it up #leadersdebate
Nick slating the conservatives is like someone who voted for the republicans questioning boarder control.
An American advert advertising breast implants on daytime TV. - Capitalism at its finest. #ITVbe
Really not a good track record of leaders at all tbh. Such as shame because it really does put people off.
Idk it just really upsets me that Labour chose ED MILIBAND as their party leader. Such a huge mistake ffs.
Stalling twice on the A9 with two school buses behind you is not the best.
Omg: How to get a girlfriend... https://t.co/Q1lTwE89p6
Teachers that don't let you out to get water, got to the toilet etc are probably the same type of folk that use hand signals whilst cycling.
Omg I love it when I hear Eminem songs I haven't heard in a while
Did my mum honestly come in and ask if I wanted to go on a drive just so if I said yes she could moan at me?! Jesus Christ
School makes me depressed asf 😞
Unless there's a legit reason obvs
People that take days off for nabs and exams and then expect everybody else to work around them are very arrogant.
Just waiting for Nick Clegg to pop up and tell us this is a Lib Dem party political broadcast #Coalition
Omg, Gordon's put on accent in coalition is making me boke.
Doesn't even make a difference to the word count just making me want to spew looking at it.
Upset me to such an extent that I've made a typo on my extended essay plan that I am considering going to the library tomorrow to fix it. 😦
Wouldn't be surprised if the cold tablets I've been taking contain high levels of estrogen.Been an absolute car crash all day for no reason.
People that are actually angry about Jeremy Clarkson having been sacked need to reevaluate their values.
Omg @Daaaisy3 just found out all Chris lilley series are on Netflix
Two hours though, killed me
Managed to survive a poker game against 11 people for the last two months yet two hours with my little brother and.. http://t.co/4cC97a7Xng
Guess the Beats wanker. http://t.co/BuL8vXT6pO
I can't believe its taken me six years to realise I hate and have no talent in learning foreign languages.
I'm so proud of myself for putting a spare set of headphones in my school bag. 😇🎶
My mum is the worst for replying to my messages 😣😣😣
Got to stop kidding myself on that watching 'house of cards' will ensure my pass in the american topic of my modern studies exam.
If this god damn cold is this bad during my prelim tomorrow I will stab myself in the eye with my pen.
Love being at work on my own, can just make bountiful cups of tea whilst revising and feeling sorry for myself. 😳
Fuck it
🙍🙍
I bought so much food to fuel my revision and all I've done is eat the food and watch Jeremy kyle.
Jeremy Clarkson is an obnoxious right wing clown who isn't fit to present a power point let alone a TV show.
Once again loving it
Swear to god, thought my Biology teacher was going to phone NASA today he was so bloody excited by the eclipse. 😂🌒
"@INeedThisNow_: I need this for the rainy days 😂 http://t.co/pI4SV7OVSD" If I saw somebody with this I'd run them over.
When I see British emigrants on American reality shows complaining about immigration it makes me laugh.
His many scandals does UKIP need? Stop acknowledging them them and they will go away.
Nothing worse than girls that constantly look for boys attention. Get a grip, you look pathetic.
Happy Birthdaay gav!!! Can't believe you're 18. 🎉🎊🍸
Waiting for the beat to drop https://t.co/BNTFgw95Pb
What can I do?
I'm in a fantastic mood this morning. Give it time.
I wonder who will clean the sink tomorrow seeing as we have received an letter of eviction warning for the common room. 😂
Always love a good Eminem track thrown into a film.
An evening isn't an evening without some cunt spoiling it anymore.
The Whistle has been blown.
Five fucking years with her
Thing I will most definitely miss least about school is Mrs Fullerton's shitey reg.
I find it hard to tell if I'm just really tired or if some people are being deliberately moronic a lot of the time.
Such arrogance.
