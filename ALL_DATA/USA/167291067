I don't think there's anything I love more than the sun☀️💖
they should honestly give us days off of school on sunny days in Washington state
how can you be okay with yourself if you don't brush your teeth
I'm really thirsty and by thirsty I mean for water
can't wait to graduate and start my life over in a new town :)
i love taking care of things

I'm definitely about to tan all weekend ☀️👙💕

"you're only invisible to those who don't deserve to see you" wow I guess you're all assholes
since when did it become a cool thing for white boys to use the n word all the time? it's foul and not funny
I'll never understand people who don't like spicy food
everyone with their wanna be inspirational quotes on Twitter can suck a fuck cuz you're all repeating the same shit
sometimes I really love my teachers
the people in my school are so annoying
buy me a stripper pole please
this world is an awful place
I'm constantly putting everyone else first and always being there for people, I don't understand why no one can do the same for me
I'm always up with the moon 🌝
I can't believe how cute my dog is http://t.co/K3wloILANK

hey
I wanna go to the beach this weekend 🌊🌞
just because it's raining doesn't mean you need to go 30 below the speed limit fucknuts
I don't like you
I mean is it even worth going back to school after this

I need my headphones 😩

one coffee isn't enough
ew I actually have to wake up at a decent hour tomorrow
I should go put gas in my car so I don't have to do it in the morning but I don't feel like getting up #firstworldproblems
i know i have nice boobs
really wish you guys would shut the fuck up like I'm so ready to move the fuck out
I want ten bottles of vodka
it feels so good to make my own money 😌
it's kind of funny how horses are so retarded
as much as the sun needs to moon to exist, they can't be together
how about you mind your own god damn business sir
very drunk
I can't wait until the Lana del Rey concert 😁
i honestly wish i didn't have to leave the beach
is it normal that sometimes I want someone to break my neck or am I just a freaky bitch
you are so important to me http://t.co/M7CKvLRbTv
drugs may not solve your problems but they sure as hell make you feel better for awhile 👌🏽
filling out job applications is really starting to make me want to shoot myself in the face

honestly don't know what I'm going to do with my life
who doesn't fucking love Lana del Rey
i feel like I'm on drugs
I don't want to grow up because growing up means calling and scheduling my own appointments and I don't think I can do this
I feel so out of it and my head is pounding, I think I'm dying. is this how it ends??
i want to be your favorite place to go when you've had a bad day or a good day

nelly and ruca are so cute http://t.co/JM2lFQ2tbd
dental and therapy appointments tomorrow, plus work. my anxiety is building up because I'm scared this is too much responsibility for me 😂😂😂
even after almost dying and having to go through two surgeries, my eyebrows still look cute
I just want to thank the higher power for giving me nearly flawless eyebrows
wtf

I'm invisible
sitting here makes me so nervous 😥
people either make me mad or sad. that's it
I need a bottle of vodka
I'm so ready to graduate
it's really annoying how I'm having a hard time and you're just trying to one up me and make me feel like I have nothing to be sad about.
today I just want to sit in the dark
I can't wait until Friday
my legs hurt and I can't sleep 😂
