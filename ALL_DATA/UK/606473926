Some people are so mentally weak
The girls on this Bear Grylls Island are useless, why didn't they place markers/ visual cues so they could find their way back ?
Tonight was a game where we needed Morley, M.Monas and Carvell all to come off the bench
If only bridge had scored first ! Odds would have been doubled.. 28/1 üò≠
Had monas and bridge both on to score first! Monas came through, Bridgey bags the second, just monas for another and were laughing
Monas is a banker for first try scorer
To think that the first year of university is almost over is #Mental
Who are you?... I'm just a concerned third party üëåüèæ
POI
There is literally only 1 decent module this semester
