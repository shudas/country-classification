Just sang karaoke and everyone loved it... What is going on
I just want to sit in my garden and chill out but there are too many 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
I want to be rich, I want lots of money, I don't care about clever or care about funny. I want lots of clothes and lots of diamonds! 💍🎵

Love Is... Kindness™ – 12pc Wrap Kit | Royal &amp; Langnickel - Beauty UK http://t.co/PYx7RTmwd4 loan must drop so I can buy this brush set
Technically this is because I have a load of dead hair attached to my head 😫💆🙍

My face today as I'm writing this research project. Literally 📝😫🔫 http://t.co/9bRv8lAf6G

Looks like 4G has launched in Bath and nobody told me 🙌
Had no idea how beautiful Oxford was. Definitely a city for me to visit! #DayTrip
Going to bed with hiccups feels a lot like riding a bike into hell
All my empty bottles &amp; tubs.. Do you think @LushLtd will give me a free face mask 💁 http://t.co/PcoGoYZqUi
Why is there a mosh pit. It ain't grime
It would be nice to have a mascara that doesn't just stick my eyelashes together for once
I just want my loan to drop so I can go and buy my @PANDORA_UK princes tiara ring 😫 http://t.co/zV8aVqKGsw

Actually can't change a light-bulb, I just can't
Just had a power cut and I'm scared of the dark #help 😨
Who else has voted on @LushKitchen http://t.co/iflNCW9YFP
Omg @jasminwalia's dog deserved a trophy for cuteness 😍
Hit a dead end with my dissertation &amp; my thumb nail just snapped clean off! Has not been the best of days 😫👎
Not a very happy bunny @LushLtd http://t.co/6TYtVUMCAm
I bet you neither @Beyonce or @KimKardashian are being woken everyday by builders? Wy must my beauty sleep be disturbed! 😫💤
Actually have anxiety over the builders who are starting work at 7am! 💤💤
Today's vibes #sorrynotsorry http://t.co/ABeaRmbLUS
Nobody told me that Vicks could give you spots before I smothered my pillow in it 😫😷
Been ridiculously tired all day and now I can't drift off 😫😫😫😫💤😴
Will literally have to sleep with tissue up my nose tonight
Decided against @BellamiHair and @DTYLOOKS... So @LforPrincess do not disappoint! ✌️😍
You're sold out of shade Organic in every single set of extensions @DTYLOOKS When will you have more in?????????????????
Basically http://t.co/tZBHpXsSZy
Anyone using Nexis off-campus? It is soooo slow! Proving impossible to search anything @UEL_News
Why has @jasminwalia hardly been in the new series 😫
The eclipse that never was
There was no #eclipse2015 from here in East Ham
Just fell asleep on the toilet 🙇
📝😫🔫 http://t.co/3ntJM0xXu1
Ever been so tired that you can't even brush your teeth properly?
The worst thing is to look inside shops when you're as broke as I am 😫
Have like 10029292929 new spots
Can not wait until I live in a house where everybody has a normal sleeping pattern (I.e home!) 🙏
Think I've developed a cold 😫😤
I want the Paris dress from @AtsukoKudoLatex more than I want air to breath
Them days when you can't decide to take a shower or have a bath 🙈
People need to control their children for real! Been banging out my dissertation over the weekend &amp; just want a nice, peaceful roast 😫🙏
Happy Mother's Day to my mummy bear 🐻 Beautiful inside and out ❤️💖 crazy, little African lady! https://t.co/w45Uzwy32Q
Is there another name I can use for an interview? Such as calling a survey a questionnaire #helpme #dissertation
Just dropped my iPad on my face 😒🙍
I wanted to try the #RoseBombshell @LushLtd 🛀🌹😁 http://t.co/QTBr2PNeMT
Omg the shapchat stories from #CancunSpringBreak make my life seem so bleak! What I'd give to be there 😫🔫
How me and @MeghanRoseRigby keep ourselves entertained is by holding pinky fingers, hehe 👆
When you cut out your lecture to gobble down a quick breakfast 😂😏 http://t.co/Rr2KT36Ro0
East Ham is alive at this time!
Laying in bed thinking about how I can't wait to see my big boy over Easter. Gotta get this… https://t.co/3ECKLKsrBH
When you wake in the middle of the night for the toilet but then can't get back to sleep 😫🙏
Only been at uni for an hour but already been completely thrown off! Need to find @Lauramaguire_4 for a cuddle
It takes people hours to read my snapchats but they're online on whatsapp #huh #whatyoudoing
If I don't sleep normally tonight I'm going to roll into uni tomorrow and throw onions at everybody so they can cry like me! #SorryNotSorry
Can literally finish a Capri Sun in approximately 10 seconds. Then it's gone and I'm like "oh why can't you last forever" :(
Not happy! Can't sleep because I drank too much, too late 😫😴
Ever eat so fast that you can't breath?
Idiots who drive through quiet residential areas blaring music from their cars have no fucking respect
I don't know why I do this! I'm hungover &amp; exhausted but instead of sleeping I'll sit here browsing on my phone 😫🔫😴
The real question is how drunk were we at @TheRoofGardens 🍸💃🙈 http://t.co/GtVq690U5S
Absolutely buzzing for tonight at @TheRoofGardens always nice visiting a venue for the first time 🍸💃👌
What's with these aches and pains in my legs 😫👵
Mood http://t.co/o4jC12Bdiu
I've smelt some smelly weaves in my life
I hate that when I have no money there's so much I want to do, buy and book but as soon as I have money it'll all be gone
Finally number 1 in the @KimKHollywood 😁☝️
My favourite part about going to uni is sticking my beats earphones in on the way there and zoning out to some @kanyewest ☝#ALLDAY
Not enough snacks is a real killer 🍫🍞🍩
BC govt plans to cull wolves rather than stopping oil, mining and logging destruction. Sign http://t.co/gcIkuwBZgC with @SumOfUs

I genuinely can't afford to go online and order Mrs Whippy from the @LushKitchen but if someone really loves me they would go get it for me!
If I can write 700-1000 words a day then I can technically finish my dissertation in 8 days... So why can't I just put pen to paper 😫😫😫😫
Today I set out to start my dissertation but that didn't happen 🙈
Next Thursday @hideoutfestival tickets go on resale! 😁😃
Catching up with #TOWIE and my favourite @Chloe_Sims lost her cool, everyone really needs to stop winding her up. The poor pretty ❤️
