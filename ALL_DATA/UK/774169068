Can't wait for Great British Menu to come back on
I wish I could get in to all this politics stuff
Oh well I tried 💁
I don't know why my parents trust me to make the dinner, I screw up in some way every time 😂

I get annoyed with people faaaar too easily for the slightest things 👎
Archie is convinced he's a gangster because he's wearing his hood up inside
Nah, did I actually just witness my neighbour teaching his three year old how to drive a full sized quad?
A minute ago she asked me  "Has David electrocuted you yet?" 😶
I always right down what Charlotte says to me when she's sleep talking because it is just so weird and I don't want to forget :')
College tomorrow means getting up even earlier and spending 4 hours on a bus. Please kill me now
The programme that is, revenge itself can be fun 😏😏
