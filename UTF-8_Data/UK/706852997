You know what's worse than liking a person who doesn't like you back?
Liking two people who don't like you back
My favourite thing about you is when you ignore me for like 6 months xx
How did you not know I liked you? 
I made people want to throw themselves down the stairs because I spoke about you so much
Perfect just when I'm over you, you decide to put me to the test and message me

The amount of dodgy screenshots on my phone is just ridiculous

I can't believe I got shat on by a seagull
I think I'm getting the cold
Some little shit gave me the cold
I can not believe I witnessed someone stealing from Primark
I seriously thought Primark was cheap enough so that you didn't have to steal
Sarah and Haris are relationship goals
I'm ready to move out
My mum's cheek towards me is seriously getting out of hand
Would do absolutely anything to be some place hot and getting a tan 🌞🌞
That beautiful moment when after months of suffering you are finally over someone
Hate it when I have zero plans

I love it when boys wear Calvin Kleins 😍😍😍😍😍
"Imagine if seagulls were chickens" - Megan MacD
Shit that was a bit risky
Stealing Nathan Mackenzie's hat and having him chase me around tesco for like ten minutes was the highlight of my day
My laugh could literally make someone go deaf :/
I really don't understand why you're talking to me when you're like a perfect 10
A polish guy on instagram - "I love you like I love weed... I want more" 
I love being Polish
Would rather be punched repeatedly in the throat then go to double maths tomorrow

Sam Smith makes me happy
Me and Lara can keep a conversation going even if we have one word answers
Em excuse me TopShop but I clearly bought black Jonis not grey ones
The minute I got my exam timetable I felt the urge to jump out a window
Can't believe I mistook someone's flowers for a christmas tree
Who does that?
I hope Vicki MacCulloch gets to be a prefect xx
But that's just standard
The crappier the joke the more I laugh
So funny how I found the nat 4 added value for maths hard
Don't get why I'm even bothering with nat 5
The thing that keeps me going is that in two years time I'll be out of this prison for children xx
