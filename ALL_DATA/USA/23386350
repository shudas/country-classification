I come to the library to watch tv shows and annoy people that actually have homework to do.
Lol... @briacreeden2 http://t.co/TUW2mGTaeP
Just tried to sneak under a girls umbrella with her... Boy did she not think that was cute.
Lol.. Debating on yelling "TROLL IN THE DUNGEON" on the third floor right now.... #potterpotterpotter
People don't comeback from the third floor of the library.
😂😂😂 I think Jerry thinks the reservable study rooms are sound proof, because I can hear everything he's saying across the third floor.
Made an appointment for Thursday at 11:05 to get my haircut. Yes, I'm tweeting this hoping somebody will remind me when the time comes.
I walked @BrianbreezyHall his class today. #bae #banking #greatwestern #trap #test #carsandstuff #hashtag
You ever accidentally touch your lips against the water fountain and then freak out, and scream "Quarantine".... Asking for a friend.
This morning everybody raised their hands when asked if they have read "To kill a Mockingbird" besides me. I read half a book in HS. #focus
No fear, only ambition.
The rain is so peaceful.
Lol, no worries, we found Brian.
🏀. Is. Life.

Easy on the ice, pal.
Things not to do when a fire erupts in your kitchen: 1. Yell, oh no! Fire. 2. Freeze up and don't move. 3. Run out of the house.
Okay... So... Earlier.. I started a fire in the apartment.. But don't worry.. I put it out. You shoulda seen Jerry's face 😂😂 he froze up.
😂😂😂😂😂 I'm dead.  https://t.co/LHvth4Qngw
Chris is the kinda guy that says he wants to hangout, and then he takes you to American Family Insurance. @ChrisRoush30
When @KoltCline tells you his workout plan for the day. @BrianbreezyHall http://t.co/ihChvqkLwS

Opening day is such a beautiful thing. 😍
Oh man, guys, I wish you could see Jerry's face everytime he says something &amp; I say I'm gonna tweet it. 😂😂 he just looks so defeated lol

First off, george clooney doesn't get the credit when it's due, man.

I honestly love track meets.
S/O floppy discs. #neverforget

4th street is done! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA APRIL FOOLS AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
I wonder if my roommates ever get tired of me singing Beyoncé in the shower?
It's a beautiful day to make an impact on people's lives.
I feel like 84 trains hit me, somehow I survived and as I was crawling to the hospital 6 cars ran me over. #metaphor4dayz
Strikes and spares baby!!
Bowling league is bae.
You should see my coloring books, that's when I had my life together.
Things have been pretty crazy lately.
Made a pretty mediocre red dead redemption joke at the dinner table tonight, nobody got it, but boy did I get a good giggle out of it.
I also learned not to turn into oncoming traffic in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Not my best judgment call on taking that left turn.
One thing I learned about our spring break trip is that I'm not meant to stay in one place for long. Traveling everywhere just makes sense.
You wanna know just where I'm at? Well, let me tell you bout it.
I'm about 67% sure I broke my wrist this morning, but that other 33% thinks that I'm fine, because I'm nothing close to a doctor.
Thinking about it.. The teacups have gotta be the most under appreciated ride at a theme park.
Haha, Adventureland is actually one of my favorite movies haha.
My grandma just called me just to say "Are you still in Kansas, Dorothy?!" And then she proceeded to giggle for like 30 seconds, lol.
Lol, and definitely reads better than I do.
There was an 8 year old eating breakfast in the lobby of our hotel, reading a book by herself... She's already more independent than I am.
Drove through 8 different dust storms, hit 834 freaking tumbleweeds, missed a tornado by an hour and that's Oklahoma for ya.
You really can't beat traveling with your best friends. 💯
Also, vote Rick Perry.
Already got in an argument with our waitress about Iowa. She has no clue that I don't play.
In Texas. Let me tell ya a little bit about Texas. They love their guns, they love their freedom and they really love their trucks.
S/O Santa Fe, lol
10 bucks says that one of two things happen to my car during the night. 1. It's gone, period. Or 2. Local gangs spray paint all over it.
The hotel we just checked into makes you feel like at any second you could be the victim on an episode of cops.
In New Mexico, LOL.
Paseo Del Pueblo
