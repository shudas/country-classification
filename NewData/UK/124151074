Varane turned on the turbo there!
One for the Stone Roses fans: thoughts on The Seahorses?
How irritating is Jim Murphy? It's actually difficult to watch a TV programme with him on it.
Love that finish from El Alagui. Player I rated at Falkirk.
Despicable by Malonga
What on earth was Scott Brown thinking there? Got himself out of a hole with the penalty save.
Stunned by that quick defeat for @DRkneevil. Didn't quite look right before the fight started to me. Confident it's a one-off though.
Morton subs: Scullion, McKee, Miller, Ferris, MacDonald, Adam (gk).
Morton (442): Gaston; Kilday, Crighton, Lamie, Russell; J. McCluskey, O'Ware, Forbes, S. McCluskey; McManus, Caldwell.
David Templeton and Lee Wallace must rue the day they decided to join/stay with Rangers. Such a setback for their development as players.
Another big win for Livingston tonight. Delighted for David Hopkin.
Well done on the hat-trick tonight, @thomasorr8!
