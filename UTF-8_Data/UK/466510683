Everything seems to be falling into place #notlongnow
Take it Richard Wilson thinks there's no point in us turning up on Sunday then @BBCSportsound
Not sure that the Alloa chairman understands what fans put up with in the premiership?
Comedy gold on sportssound just now btw
Car crash defence from the @spfl on @BBCSportsound  at the moment.
A black day at spfl towers it seems! Couldn't run a play school picnic it seems.......
Just finished listening to the @ICTFC podcast! Good stuff! Glad to see it back.
The @spfl totally missing the point? If they hadn't moved the Hearts game at such short notice they'd not have been in this mess!!!
I find myself agreeing with Euan Murray omg what has happened to me ????
Seems like the SPFL are rattled! They never get it do they?
Go Ann Budge.......and Leanne Dempster! Takes the woman to stand up to the @spfl #farseoftheirownmaking
No wonder Hearts fans raging! Absolute disgrace changing game so late!!!
Seems like being positive on CTO is as frowned upon as being negative these days?
At least we've got the fixtures anyway......
Do the tv companies get any input into actually making up the fixtures then? Or just choosing from those produced?
So Celtic supporters all arrive at ground at last minute but it's all @ICTFC s fault according to the @Record_Sport? Arrive earlier yes?
Further proof that fans don't seem to matter to Doncaster and Co. Only concerned with tv
Wonder how good County would be if they actually started their season same time as the rest of us!
Arquin was always an odd signing for St Mirren and hasn't proved a good one either!
It's like comedy cuts at St M Park, first funerial music now euro pop???Also Stewart Gilmour should man up? Boards will always be criticised
