Swear I only go on Twitter when I'm angry or emotional😂😂
Don't even know how I feel, like every emotion possible
My heads going to explode in a minute, thinking about loads of things all at once
Too many feelings I don't know how to work them out
Never been brought flowers till today, thanks work😆 http://t.co/f54bpf3u58
Need food
Cuddles and a back tickle would be perfecto
Can't wait till people start driving and realise how expensive it is✋✋😭
I just hate mornings so much
Compulsive liar😤
Need some positivity
If all you want me for is lifts see you later mate✋✋✋
Don't understand how some mums can go out every week, like shouldn't you be spending your benefits on your kid(s)? Go get a job✋
There are many things that I would like to say to you but I don't know how
Mehh wanna feel like myself again😣
When people put conversations as their status, unless it's hilarious I don't get it😭
Two faced people are jokes😂😂
So upsetting I have to pay for my prescription now:(
Need sleep just can't shut off my mind
Wish I never met you
Wish I had someone I could just tell everything and them not judge me.and tell everyone else. So much I need to get off my chest
Now I've finished all series of veronica mars and watched the film.I'm sad want more.
Go from happy to angry to sad in the space of seconds
So Fucking rude!!!! Should've given me what's paid for!!! http://t.co/C2LHsclp2w

So down at the moment and don't even know why
I wish there was someone who I could just talk to about everything and they not judge me or tell anyone else
Ridiculous when you see people you were once close with and they act like you're a stranger

So happy I've finally passed my test, took a while to get used to my car but feeling more comfortable and confident now☺️
Finally something that might actually work☺️

Need to stop going back to the past and move forward
Wish it was acceptable to not wear shoes
Dad forgot to put the garlic bread in the oven😔
Heavy part of a bench fell on my foot, ouchiesssss

I just wish fluffy socks were acceptable to wear instead of shoes
I need someone to pick all my clothes out for me

Wouldn't mind live snapcgats if they fdid like 3 a day but I can't deal with 100+ second stories
