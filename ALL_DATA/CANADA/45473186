Some times you just need to laugh until it hurts and then have a real deep conversation. @Chynna_Tobias #greatnight #greatfriend

I thoroughly enjoyed the @transitapp update notice. http://t.co/2o6HKwixop
I keep forgetting younger people are still in school...then I get confused when I see them at school.
Can we talk about how in only a matter of days I'll be holding the fat thing that is my cat? #soexcited #iwantmycat
I stayed up all night because I started a puzzle and couldn't see any of my clocks, so I just kept going. Gotta love uni life.
Well I got an interview for a place..but they want to interview me before I'm home, oops? 🙈🙊
Ready to fall asleep on the city bus..I think I'm a little tired.
How to tell we have entered finals week: everyone is dead tired, dressed in sweats, and looks like they haven't showered in days #university
"I can't sleep on my pillow cause of my make up..." @alivia_mae_ #firstworldproblems
I forgot how much I hate job hunting... 😒
It's weird being allowed to use your phone while writing a final...
Just having a wonderful day ❤️
I honestly have up listening as soon as you brought a Costco cart into the discussion, sorry prof.
When your only class for the day finishes early 👌
I may have flipped out when I saw this @tommcfly @MrsGiFletcher This is awesome!! http://t.co/u1WhkviaFo
Thanks for the Easter bunny Swiss Chalet :) #chocolate #easter #swisschalet #bunny https://t.co/3e0bNTj63G
Jeez, way to grill our group lady. Learn when to give up.
I want food. But I'm stuck in this presentation.
At least I got some good news today.
I honestly want to turn around and tell this girl to shut up. You don't need to constantly interrupt the prof and say stupid shit.
Please stop being a condescending bitch. It's really just annoying.
"I'm at war with cows!" I love this prof.
"I like orange juice. And burgers. There's a chance I'll be having a burger tonight." I swear this is hydrology class.
"I like that back there..should set up a bar or something, need some rum." I think my hydrology prof is ready for the semester to be dkne
The sun is shining and the trees are turning green. Spring is here ❤️ #spring #sunshine #green #trees… https://t.co/7kGRguaUKA
People are awake finishing papers and stressed about it...and I'm just sitting here doing puzzles online 👍
I now have a rainbow fan :) #rainbow #colour #fan #bored #decoration https://t.co/UMgwIvCLrF
When you get out of bed and get ready for class only to discover your prof cancelled it via email.
Dammit.
I get a little bored when I procrastinate. #doodle #art #colour #bored #procrastination https://t.co/lYWl6rsicg
My roommates amaze me. They are adults living alone and don't know how to turn a tap off.
"Oh sweet pyjamas that worked!" My hydrology prof got a little excited about an equation working.
I hate this....I just want my mom here to tell me everything will be okay.
When you find out two of your finals are open book...yes!
Happy birthday @NoahBearz101 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 #yourelegalnowbiznatch #birthday #19
"I wish booze was cheaper in BC..and food." That's totally related to hydrology, good job prof.
I'm about ready to punch one of you...I do not need this shit my life, especially right now.
Like I get you don't like me..but we are in a group together. So stop being a bitch until this s done. I can only do so much.
There's a girl in my class who's wearing glasses but there isn't any lenses in it..why.
Update: hospitals suck and the unknown is terrifying.
Hospitals suck.
It's amazing how alone someone can feel when they are surrounded by people.
Well ladies, according to the 1800s, if you wanted to become smarter you had to cut off part of your vagina. #nothankyou #peoplewereweird
You have all the hours in the day to sweep, and you choose 2am? #ruderoommate #goaway

I love Disney...but we do not need a Frozen 2
Oh the decisions I make at 3:30 in the morning...
Wondering if @alivia_mae_ has a working phone because I need to talk to her :P

"Then I have a problem...if I'm a plant....I kind of look like a plant right now." #geographyprof
When your prof doesn't realize he put an image of two bugs mating in his power point until it's being shown in class #geography
Random 4am memories: ReBoot. Fuck that show was weird.
Just told myself I need to go to bed because its like midnight....it's 4am.
Damn daylight savings time...you mess with my mind once again!
What the heck..last time I looked at the clock it was like 1am. And suddenly it's after 3am.
We need to do Debby's soon, yes? @NoahBearz101 @alivia_mae_ @selena_rae7 @geedhaliwal
I am so okay with the amount of bubbles in my room right now. #bubbles #bubblemachine #sohappy https://t.co/NraG1W9vRU
It's days like yesterday that make me thankful that @FrantasticFranc is in my life to get my through the tough days ❤️
Some people amaze me with their slight patheticness...
I am now taking applications for people who will run away to Europe with me forever. #newlife?
It sucks having your best friend live far away when you need her and a hug
It's slightly terrifying knowing that my life could be changed by tomorrow afternoon.
Nothing like researching the treatment of insane people during the 19th century in England
Nothing like being woken up at 730am by your roommates super annoying alarm that keeps going off for nearly half an hour.
Can we talk about how I'm going home next month?! #excited #home #mycat #mynephew #theocean
