I love this side job I have that I went to today.Spent much of the time drinking &amp; smoking joints there &amp; still got paid handsomely.
I'm at the pub right across from the shop I'm working in.I can see the shop from here so I'm basically still working. http://t.co/UMGxMsmH87
I need to buy the most innocent looking bag I can find to keep all my bdsm toys in
Got nothing to rest my phone on while I'm watching stuff on it in bed.See this is one one situation where I could do with a pair of tits.
Working again in the butcher's shop today, things get well boring in there.Luckily there's a pub right across the road
My body won't sleep now if I haven't worked out that day, suppose that's a good thing
Whenever they speak Vilaryan or Dothraki in GOT you need to activate the DVD subtitles to know what they're saying, what's it like on TV
People these days have to have everything here &amp; now, it takes the feeling of excitement &amp; accomplishment out of things
Why are people so excited that episodes of game of thrones were leaked? What's so bad about waiting a week &amp; seeing them normally &amp; legally?
Had a good size day at work today, killed 380 sheep &amp; 37 cattle. Felt great having fresh blood on my blade again after 2 weeks off.
Uncle Acid &amp; the Deadbeats UK tour happening later this year, fuckyeah

Now is a good time of year to buy mutton (lamb meat) because they're leaner.Don't buy from us though, it would mean more work from me.
I'm back at work &amp; the spring lambs are here, it's that time of year again. They're bigger &amp; healthier.
Some dreams are just too true to be good
Have a good international siblings day everyone, and be thankful you don't have 9 of them like me. http://t.co/zVsc17NlY7
I have that awful feeling you get when haven't slaughtered anything for almost 2 weeks :-/ Looking forward to going back to work tomorrow.
Going to miss Lisa when she moves to Japan. Crazy metal chicks like her make the earth a habitable environment. http://t.co/l5OMtrT86K
Amy &amp; I got photobombed by a ghosts hand last night http://t.co/cRUIwBmlVL
Both sides of every argument always seem to think that "society" is against them
Was supposed to buy a cane &amp; paddle at club lash last night but  I kept putting it off &amp; by the time I went to buy them they'd packed up :-/
No game of thrones spoilers please, I'm still on season 3
Looking forward to going back to work tomorrow, I'v been away too long.
A well experienced domme last night said she was impressed by my skill with the horse crop.It was actually my first time using it.
Club lash last night was epic as usual
It's pouring outside &amp; I'm dead bored.
Nicola insisted on platting my beard again last night -_- http://t.co/eqkVXryh8Q

Explored these ruins of a 13th century Abbey yesterday in Yorkshire http://t.co/pOrJAgtCMl
Really not into technology.I prefer things you can fix with a hammer or screw when they break, not switch them off &amp; on &amp; hope for the best.

Looking forward to going to the deer park tomorrow, I love deer.Watching them, admiring them, hunting them.True symbol of the wild.
There are more slaves in Africa &amp; Asia today than there ever were in America, stop associating white people with slavery.
