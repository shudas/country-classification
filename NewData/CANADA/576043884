I think the next PC Government can be more accountable. We just need a first round draft pick, a goalie and a couple of defenceman #abvote
I'm thinking about forming my own political party: The Brown Party. It's like The Green Party only slightly more oxidised. #abvote
Based on yard signs I've seen I'd say this election is a close race between "Garage Sale" "For Sale and "Beware of Dog" #abvote #strawpoll
It's Old Home Week for me on the show. Looking forward to @LeadingEdgePT @JesseKupina and talking @EdmontonHumane with Henri Rodier. #yeg
Brendan Shanahan just called to inform me I've been fired by the @MapleLeafs. Quite surprising considering I've never worked for them. #yyz
These winds in #yeg are really something. Our house just blew away but on the positive side we discovered we had original hardwood floors.
New Alberta election poll projects slim Wildrose majority. They also predict the Oilers will win the Stanley cup in 5 games. #abvote

Congratulations to all you @NHLFlames, @VanCanucks and @NHLJets fans. Enjoy the post season. #NHLPlayoffs

The AB and NDP parties have a few PC domain names that go to their sites but the PC's have 11 MLA's that went direct to their party. #abvote
It's hard to believe Pitlick's been out of the line-up for over 3 months and yet when he last played we were out of the play-offs.
If anyone would like one of my lawn signs let me know. I'm not running for anything I just really like my name. #abvote
I'm predicting a majority PC government in the #abvote. I'm also predicting it will snow in Canada and Las Vegas will make a profit.
Not sure if the writ dropped but my jaw did when they played Prentice up to music. #abvote
So @derekhough was able to teach an Olympic Champion how to dance? I'd be more impressed if it was @MamaJune_BooBoo. #DWTS
How's it possible that the "Caramilk Secret" was kept for decades and yet everyone knows the Premier is calling an election? #abvote
After a month off I hit the gym and the gym hit back. Even my hair is sore. #AndTwoMore
What are the odds @AETV would cancel #NeighborswithBenefits the very weekend I had planned to watch it with someone else's wife. #awkward
