crown the empire urny even relevant, danny suede is an actual joke for thinking people care about his shite opinions

he probably would've voted no and that's why he's so mad at that lassie having 45% in her bio x

poussey in oitnb is so important
the process of geoff ramsey trying to remember the word "scousers" http://t.co/yABHBAE78c
she has all these ambitions to travel too and she's so sweet and has so many good intentions i LOVE her she must be protected at all costs
i love morello in oitnb so so much i forgot how much her character meant to me
it's romanticised abuse and i don't get why anybody would think it would be okay to watch for entertainment purposes
shit going dowwwwwwn over 50 shades of grey
i didn't know oitnb's theme song was sang by regina spektor that's so cool
"hey kimmy, 1996 called, it wants its clothes back."
"hey xan, 2090 called, you're dead and you wasted your time on earth."

what about team lads :( what about x ray and vav :( what about the r and r connection :(

Ray is leaving roosterteeth. it's 7am and this is already the worst day i have had in a long time
-age 15
-to play people who are ACTUALLY that age because for the audience it's aimed at they end up wondering why they don't have an adult body at-
i'm 15 + i don't look like that and NOBODY my age looks like that + it's damaging to our self images, why cant they get real teenage actors-
xanthippe in unbreakable kimmy schmidt is meant to be 15 and she looks like 25 this is so :/
i can't wait to fight all time low when i next see them
