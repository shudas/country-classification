I find that I do 99% of all the initation. I'm assertive and extrovreted, but I find I'm the one who makes things happen.
Do you initate conversations? Or do you wait for others to contact you? #WonderingWednesday
I have an uncontrollable urge to keep getting bigger and bigger.
Chest day feels so nice. Pecs feel swole #BamBRUTE

I have a dream that one day Air Canada won't cancel, delay, or reroute my flights without notifying me :) Shame that won't happen. Ever.
Anyone in Vancouver have the day off right now? I've got a huge layover.
The longest journey home is about to start. Wake me up when it's over?
