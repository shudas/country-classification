Out of all the pictures of next week's #Arrow this one worries me the most. http://t.co/mGHtA9CdaC via @TheTVJunkies http://t.co/sQCtwXkhpx
Just had a lovely chat with @caterinatweets. Watch for our interview @TheTVJunkies in the next few weeks.Thanks again Caterina #GreysAnatomy
Let's be honest, what would #Castle be about without Beckett? A writer and......um.....yeah, so no show.
Well this one makes much more sense. Still doesn't sound good for #Castle though. http://t.co/iFguJIDdEd
Ok that @TVLine article makes absolutely no sense. #Castle.
Seriously though, is it next Wednesday yet? #Arrow
Holy ffffffffffffffffff #Arrow.
Let her go Ray, just let Felicity go. She doesn't love you. #Arrow.
I did NOT see that coming at all. #Arrow
WTF? #Arrow.
Roy üò©üò≠ #Arrow
WHERE ARE THE GUARDS??? #Arrow.
Ugh this is heartbreaking. Poor Oliver. #Arrow
If you touch Felicity you are going to have to deal with the wrath of Christy. That's not good. #Arrow
You're the man the I L....  Oh come on Felicity. Just say it already. #Arrow.
There's a descent chance that you and Palmer are related. LOL! #Arrow
Oh Oliver, that reaction to Ray was exactly what I've been doing for weeks. #Arrow
There's a secondary lair? #Arrow
Oh this is not good. #Arrow
Can Felicity guest on every show? She really doesn't make everything better. #TheFlash
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm actually starting to like Ray. It must have something to do with that #Arrow promo. #TheFlash
Even though they aren't together (yet) @ARROWwriters are still doing right by #Olicity. http://t.co/5aHb2Mtq9H #Arrow http://t.co/Eln3f3MF8g
Oy, if that sneak peek is any indication to how amazing this season of #RookieBlue is going to be I'm not sure if I'm going to survive it.
Not gonna lie, I may just be doing a little happy dance because #RookieBlue is back May 21st in Canada. WooHoo!!! http://t.co/dGtGOWORpp
Yay!!! Finally!!! #RookieBlue  https://t.co/mQK7Yur2D4
What just happened? #TheGoodWife
This episode of #TheGoodWife has confirmed my decision to not give a shit about politics. My vote means nothing. It's all corrupt.
Does anyone else have to stop themselves from trying to look up Jamie's kilt every time he squats down or is it just me ? üò≥ #Outlander
Jon Snow!!!!! #GameofThrones
That seems like a risky place to have a meeting. What if someone trips? #GameofThrones
Because putting creepy fake eyes on a dead body is so much better than looking at normal eyelids... #GameofThrones
Basically just wasting time till #GOT comes on. #hurryupalready.
Ben Bass is singing on Periscope right now. It just might be the best thing ever.
Sydney being goofy. https://t.co/RKXiKwWp8c
One more week!!! #soexcited. #OrphanBlack  https://t.co/QywlrmlkIr
I cannot believe the awesomeness that was season 2 of #Helix. Holy crap that was good. Fingers crossed for season 3 üôè
How I did on Twitter this week: 2 New Followers, 72 Mentions, 5.16K Mention Reach. How'd your week go? via http://t.co/cFIbTn3z9U
This is one movie that you don't want to miss. It's an edge of your seat thrill ride from start to finish.  https://t.co/owKZ1TcOin
It sure is interesting that ABC can announce the air date for #RookieBlue before Global does. Especially when it's Global's show!?!
I don't know about everyone else but I am really looking forward to #ChicagoMed staring up in the fall now. It's going to be great.
Dawsey üòçüòäüòç #ChicagoFire
Bahaha!!! I so need to be that nurse tomorrow. #TheNightShift
I like the way this episode is starting üòè #TheNightShift
Griffin NO!! #RemedyTV
I'm not sure that they want quiiiite that much detail Griffin üòè #RemedyTV
Hmm, I don't see #TheVampireDiaries lasting long without Nina.
Just discovered that My So Called Life is on @CraveTVCanada. That just made my Monday. üòä
Haven't they already done this ballot tampering storyline? #boring #TheGoodWife
I was sure they were going to kill off Kalinda. Maybe she'll just end up going to jail... #TheGoodWife
I do believe I recognize that guy working for the TV station on #TheGoodWife
#Outlander really does have the best opening song ever.
