Hahsha Jamie is a class clown. Love this 😂🏈 https://t.co/0sM4YRSrmZ
If Winnipeg beat the ducks in the playoffs series I will eat a car seat... #Ducks #Jets #StanleyCupPlayoffs
Playoffs time!!!!
Look what was in my @timehop! Same with this guy too. Smythy. So sad to see him gone too a year on. http://t.co/AN3R7fGVN3
Look what was in my @timehop! What a moment this was. Last year the Finnish flash retired and said farewell 😭😭😭 http://t.co/qSQ0KzLv4Q
The new #TheFlashArrow trailer featuring fucking every character either villain or hero is EPIC!!! Watch it NOW!!!!
Hey Michigan Wolverines fans.
You just got one of our own. Make the Aussie feel welcome this summer. Great kicker!! http://t.co/WtffixjUfH
BOOM!! #HookEm Alumni  https://t.co/ii89kJeH0K
The New York Islanders rock the barn  snap chat story was super cool!! #RockTheBarn
Another team officially announced. Watch out Australia, American football is on its way! #NGL  https://t.co/h8rYLs3JtR
Good weekend finished. Parties and movies and family and girlfriend time. What good weekends are made of. 🙌
And I picked the #Blues to win the cup because it's their time. It's been brewing for 3 seasons. Tampa vs st Louis final series
There's no way the detroit Redwings are beating a redhot Tampa bay lightning team in the first round playoffs. 😔 #StanleyCupPlayoffs
Happy 13th birthday to this #Longhorn Bevo. http://t.co/bYwnVof1mB
I picked Duke to win overall!!!! Fuck yeah go me!!!!
Who won the basketball?
Holy shit #Wisconsin beat #Kentucky 😂😂😂👯👯👯
Senators won which means the wings are dangerously close now to dropping out of playoff contention :/
I tell ya, this team is not making the playoffs. The last WHOLE month has been pathetic. This team doesn't know how to show up in 3rd period
Really? Too many men on the ice detroit? Could you be any fucking stupider? #Babcock send a fucking rocket up your team! This is bullshit...
Fuck the #REDWINGS suck. They're killing me. That's on Mrazek.
Wow I actually might be able to watch hockey today. Hungover in bed on good friday. Works well
I just watched Jameis winstons pro day film. His technique has gotten better for sure. But will he adjust to scrambling under pressure?
My #Ravens pick up Matt Schaub. This is actually the smartest move. Good back up to Flacco if he should go down.
1.5 hours till the game. First I need food and all I can smell is maccas
Couple that with the fact they're launching their official PAC12 YouTube international channel for next season. The interest will be high
With the development program attached to the NGL starting here next season it makes sense that the PAC12 would bring a bowl game here.
Best news ever! The PAC12 looking at bringing a bowl game to Australia in 2016. Huge for football here!! 🏈🇺🇸
I'm playing hockey tomorrow night 8pm@at maximum skating arena @ Smeaton grange. Playing top rated Anarchy. Going to be an intense game.
I'll save you all the agony of watching the hockey this year and Give you the winner.
Mustangs to repeat. Brave 2nd NorthStars 3rd ice 4th.
Way to continue to suck #redwings 😭😰
Texas Longhorns Show Out On Pro Day Video - via @ESPN Champ Drive http://t.co/0sYxY16oyC really great showcase of the #Longhorns trials
I can't wait for the NGL to start next year. Finally a good sport which gets the deserved attention and TV rights. Football&gt;hockey
Lol the ice dogs got destroyed. The team has Alec Stephenson and that's all. That whole club is a disgrace. 😂👯😂
Best radio talk show on why the NCAA  tourney in detroit was a disaster. http://t.co/RDdQDabX3L must listen. Lots of interesting facts.
Ohhh it's the final of the cricket tonight? Who even fucking cares about that sport. Honest. http://t.co/oZF5rwqi25
Is it #Football season yet?:(
Happy 20th birthday To one of the best movies ever. @Empire__Records best music and best teenage days well spent! #empirerecords
Redwings love to throw games away
It is SO good to see this again! Oh man I miss football! #HookEm #LetsRide http://t.co/fDSiwh2eh3
I'm just really hanging out for the @NGL_Australia next year. Will certainly try to get involved with the Sydney team in some capacity! 🏈🏈🏈🏈
Told my gf I would sleep 30 mins ago. Lol still up. No idea why.
The Ravens would've gone on to win the Super Bowl if not for that vereen play. Which is now illegal. Fucking hell.
10 players out for #TEXAS during spring ball. That's a damn shame but hopefully they'll be ready by summer and healthy for fall. #HookEm
Jesse Williams back with the Seattle Seahawks. I'm happy for him!
It's a shame my winter won't be filled with watching hockey locally but tbh it's not worth writing home about.
Holy shit looked at the Sydney ice dogs roster. Fucking LOL! Can you say won't win a game. Unless it's against the useless bears at that😂👯😂👯
Need to work out what sport is going to preoccupy me for the next 5 months! HALP!!!!
Man all I want is it to be 🏈 season again y'all. Give me college football back!!! #collegefootballcountdown
Woop woop detroit actually won a game again, this makes me happy and good news to wake up to! #GoWingsGo #Redwings 🐙🚨
Is it #collegefootball season yet?
Can we fuck off Ericsson in the offseason please? He's a fucking witches hat. #redwings
The #Redwings are lucky the eastern conference sucks so much ass otherwise we would be close to a wildcard spot
What did I say #Redwings fans? Fucking hopeless team. The chemistry has gone since we got cole and zidlicky.
If the Redwings lose to Tampa today we are in deep shit
For me I would pick and rate #Mariota above #Manziel erryy day of the week.
Lol the #redwings can't even beat Florida still. Talk about a horrendous slump to be in. First round exit here we come again:/
