music for the soul

looking for salvation in the secular age
drink, fall, spew, telephone you
expect nothing appreciate everything
yeah so far it's alright baby
fuck essays i will go on an adventure tomorrow
why is it so tiring to be sober and awake
i want to find somewhere in melbourne somewhere quiet, deserted, high up, beautiful
we're speaking in bodies avoiding me and talkin bout you
my broken veins say that if my heart stops beating we'll bleed the same way
you're cold and i burn i guess i'll never learn // get lost in your earphones @ does it matter https://t.co/sWRMP50KGm
find me because i will never find you
