I need more sports channels. I want to watch playoffs but would like to switch to the Jays game during commercials. #SportsFansProblems
Lol "excitedment". New word of the night. Thanks CBC! #NHLPlayoffs
That was a brutal rebound but where was the rest of the team? #Pens
I knew I should have picked Nash. I just couldn't bring myself to.
So little qualitative literature out there to guide a Master's student through a qualitative thesis defence...
So excited to defend my thesis this Friday. Then it'll be all over. #MScN #GradSchool
Jays need to get it together. I'm tired of all my teams losing. #NJDevils #BlueJays
This is amazing. Don't fear the reaper - #BOC https://t.co/vLxb9L3OfF

Finished my deviled eggs! Now it's Easter. http://t.co/jIpOW5qZ3k
Excited to see my two babies tomorrow! üê∂üê∂ http://t.co/wwkCJh3NHH
I liked #futureshop. It was the only place I bought electronics from. Boo. Best buy is not the same.
Was it just me or was the ref in the caps end really good at getting in the way tonight?
Man, I love Gomez and his passes. He really earned his spot in the lineup. #NJDevils
I've been so impressed with @Jtootoo22  ! Not only is he lighting it up, his defensive play has been unreal here down the stretch. #NJDevs
Happy first day of spring everyone! It only goes up from here! üå∑üå∑
Great read! Long, but worth it. Scott Gomez should write a book.http://t.co/khsnkVyLxn
Almost yard sale season! Hoping to find a vintage knitting basket this year.
Best way to celebrate my birthday - Alumni game + surf &amp; turf dinner. #NJDevils #Alumni
Where is Chico? #Alumni
They did a very good job choosing the teams for this alumni game! I really can't decide who will win. White? Red? Can't wait! üòä
Bye Jagr! I'm still wearing your jersey loud and proud! So fortunate to have seen you play as a Devil. #jagr #NJDevils
Salut to all the Veterans. #NeverForget #Freedom #ThankYou
Hehe DeBoer #larsson
Yup September by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is awesome. #nostalgia
The more I think about it, Larsson should have been first star.
I like how they keep saying how great Larsson has improved...no he was always this good, he just never got the chance!
Yes. New Zealand. That's better.
Wait! Just looked at a map to try to remember more details and it wasn't Papua New Guinea! It was New Zealand I was travelling to.
I'm not sure if I've ever even given much thought to it. Have no idea why I'd dream something so random.
Had a dream I was travelling to Papua New Guinea for some strange reason. And I was very excited about it.
Tuned into The Odd Couple and a NJ devils jersey is hanging on the wall! Like this show already
I want a beagle. üê∂
It baffles me why some research costs money to access the article. Shouldn't knowledge be free? #academicproblems
I can't remember what it's like to wear a T-shirt anymore.
Congrats Leeza! @realDonaldTrump made the correct choice! #ApprenticeFinale
What are they going to do for the next 40 minutes? #ApprenticeFinale
I was really hoping Kenya would just come clean #ApprenticeFinale
#AskApprentice
When is Shrimp Fest happening @redlobster ? #Mmm
I'm getting sick of this cold. It hasn't been over 19-20 degrees in my apartment for almost four days now.
Purchased my first yarn off the internet. Might be developing a problem. #knittingproblems

Well both Laurentian and NJ lost - same score too.
I can feel the wind from my living room #Brrrrr http://t.co/TLXrUwpwHn
Sorry #NJDevils going to cheer on some different boys tonight! Go Voyageurs! #LU
RCMP üíù
I need a better wall.
It is unbelievably cold. The wind is literally piercing through my wall.
Simpsons marathon? I choo choo choose you. #ValentinesDay http://t.co/VqFwVx1obZ
No this is not an illusion. They really are two dogs. Miss these little babies (and I just saw them yesterday üòù) ! http://t.co/ln5PNGPJqa
For the first time in my life I poured the milk in the bowl before my cereal. As expected - awful.
I feel so bad for Schneider. First year he comes over, doesn't play because Brodeur wouldn't retire and now they are just brutal.
When reading Twitter becomes more fun than actually watching the game.
They would be so good if they shortened games to only two periods! Come on bettman. Get on that.
Remember the days where you'd go into a new season and have an almost guaranteed ticket to the playoffs? I miss those days #NJDevils
My prediction of a 1-0 final score is still going strong!
They need to get out of this period right now.
I'm not liking the looks of this
Well this Tootoo bit is making me cry. üò™
Harrold lol
Final score 1-0 my spidey sense didn't tell me for who though.
