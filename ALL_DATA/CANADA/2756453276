falling for the wrong person is probably the worst feeling
Ya it's hard to find a good girl in nb, especially when ur looking at girls 4 years younger than you 😊😊😊😊
do boys even have hearts or is that just a myth

my mom and Steph just had a heart to heart gor 20 mins @st3phywephy

probably too confident for my own good
