The red wings power play zone entry is unstoppable.
Whatta a line up of playoff games tonight!
The wolf of Wall Street will never get old
Don't know what I did, but I will never second guess people who walk out of my life, their not meant to be in it.
If this nice weather goes away, I go away
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chitchat
Take me to your love shack 🎵
Perfect Sunday

Always up too late
Pulling that all nighter turned out to be a success
If you are not willing to risk the usual you will have to settle for the ordinary.
Hate that
"u ever wondered how cool itd be if u could see the news from snapchat"

"introducing the new discover"

Don't ever mistake my silence for ignorance, my patience for acceptance, or my kindness for weakness.

Most cutting thing u can say is "who's this clown?" Because it implies that they're A) A clown &amp; B) not even one of the better-known clowns
