Hoping I can get a couple of days off in May so me and @Ritchie_Crypts can go and see While She Sleeps :)
Slept for at least 10 hours but still feel like I haven't slept, why? :(
Cannot wait to go to bed tonight.
May have placed a @superdrug order so big I've ended up with 5 free make up bags, one for each 3 for 2 offers, whoops! :P
So tired, me and early mornings do not go well together haha.
The Coachella line up is such a mixed bag of artists, would love to be there... Especially for AC/DC of course! :)
I normally hate summer but for some reason, I'm looking quite forward to it this year.
Last day of my time off work, start work at 6am tomorrow so I got up at 8.45 this morning to make sure I'm tired enough to sleep early :(
People who think the world revolves around them fuck me off so much... You wouldn't know justice if it slapped you on the face.
Saturday night, house to ourselves and Ritchie is bedded at 9.45 haha.
