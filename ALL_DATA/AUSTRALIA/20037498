#WorklifeDuringPlayoffs
This third period could feel like the longest 20 minutes ever recorded......
I was torn on my bracket for the blues v wild. Form says blues but just a hunch tells me the wild could do something there. Watch this space
Breaking News: Astronaut on in place of Ericsson for the 3rd
No point telling us we suck if you can't score more than 1 after 25 shots. Seriously 😂😂😂😂

YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! GET IN THERE YOU ABSOLUTE DKEKEBOSNCWKND BEAUTY!!! 🐙🚨🐙🚨🐙🚨🐙 WTG @Datsyuk13 !! #LGRW
Well I f*cking love the fact that Mrazek is so solid. Took the hit, stood up and basically said bring it the f*ck on. I LOVE THIS TEAM #LGRW
I would pay obscene amounts of money for a Wings SHG rn....
OMG!!!! Sat in exam, phone goes off, WINGS SCORE, I cheer out, coordinator looks at me. IT WAS SO WORTH IT 😂🐙😊🚨👌 Let's pull this back #LGRW
Butterflies in the stomach and just under an hour to go. Come out fast and play hard @DetroitRedWings !!! DO US PROUD 🐙🚨🐙🚨🐙 #LGRW
At this point, I'd currently prefer to shove a generous hand full of hedgehogs backwards into my rectum than read this.... #OhMyLife  #Bored
Breaking down Input tax credit entitlement percentage calculations. Welcome to my Friday morning.... 😐💀💀💀 #KillMe
OMFG just realised my exam clashes with the start of the game this morning. Well that's settled then, I'm not going.... 😐😏👌🐙 #LGRW
Rooting for the @DetroitRedWings and watching the game from Australia!! C'mon lads, it's time to paint Tampa red!!!! 🐙🏆🚨 #LGRW
Super pumped and excited for some @DetroitRedWings hockey tonight! #LGRW #Playoffs 🐙🐙🐙
Goodnight twitter 🌠🌚😴😴😴
Hard exercise session &amp; a taxation refresher for my exam tomorrow. Try not to get too jealous of my rock &amp; roll lifestyle now, won't you 😂📝😂
Shown world class restraint today. I'm going to reward myself by going home and watching more hockey.... 😏👌🍻#WINNING
That one person you work with who you could quite happily park a chair in their face... 😐
Desperately wanting the last 10 mins of my work day to fo and disappear.... 💀💀💀 #SoDoneWithItAllToday
Loose lips sink ships
Un-frigging-believable
Noooooowaayyyyyyyy!!!! CAAALGGAARRYYYY score!!
English lingo or not, Hawks sneakily nick it 4-3. Called it from the off but make no mistake, these will be both close and tough games.
I've come to the glaring conclusion that I'm going to be a vocal, emotional mess when the Wings game starts... Just warning you now #LGRW
How I feel on a Monday morning at work....  https://t.co/cz9k90IFKA
Still can't believe I just got an alert to tell me that mind you... 😂😂😂😂 #DidThatJustHappen #OhDearNHL
Love that Stone drinking from the wrong end of the bottle made the NHL highlight reel.... 😳😂😂😂
Credit where it's due, I think the Hawks are going to be tough to beat. Fancy them to nick this one
Fact is if you don't like the playoffs, then we can't be friends. #LikeOrTakeAHike
Hawk won't give this up easy. Just sayin...
Crawford got pulled. Whilst I'm not entirely surprised... wtf to that
Barely an hour in and the Playoffs are already rocking. I love this time of the year....
Preds are schooling the Hawks rn. Well that's something I thought I'd never say....  #CrazyDay #BecauseItsTheCup
Great game for the neutral. If the Sens can sustain this for another 6 games, I'll be amazed. #LGRW
Pure unbridled carnage at the Bell Centre tonight. The referees are due to turn up any second now... #SensVSCanadiens
A game for the attackers tonight... Holy shit #GoaltendersGoAWOL #SensvsHabs
Well that escalated quickly... 2-1 Habs 😳💀
Markov is having an absolute shocker rn... 💀💀💀
Also quietly rooting for the Sens to do a job, the team i think could surprise a few... #Hoping #LGRW
I predict @DetroitRedWings will win the @NHL #StanleyCup. Join the #NHLBracketChallenge http://t.co/E3bwWKN6ne

A great story of how one person can inspire another. Zetterberg truly is a champion, in every sense of the word 🐙🐙🐙🐙
Just 3 away now from the big 2500. Pure and utter madness... 😂😂😂 #AllHelpGratefullyAppreciated #NotBadForANormalLad
Goodnight all, it's been emotional.... 😏🐙🏆💭💭💭 #LGRW

Tired, lonely and fed up of being the last to find anything out... 😒😔😔 #NotHappy
Rooting for the lads tonight!!! Venison looked incredible!!!! C'mon Will and Steve!!! 🇬🇧🍖🍛😏👌 #Teamwork  #PomsForTheFinal #MKR
Thunder and lightning storms here tonight. A warm evening, the skies alight and rain tapping on the windows... Perfect 😏😈💭⚡️☔️
You can take the boy out of England, but you sure can't take England out of the boy... ❤️💂☔️🇬🇧 #ThreeLions
Decided my next @DetroitRedWings jerseys will be @Trto90 and @rsheahan15 ... Two of the very best to come 😏👌🐙🚨 #LGRW #TampaOctopi
