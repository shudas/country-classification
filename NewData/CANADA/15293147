Instead of going to celebration or Calgary, I'm going to the city for dimsum this weekend. Sounds like a win to me.
Seriously. All that does is make you look like a douchecanoe. Or, at worst, the CEO of the Douchecanoe corporation.
Today's nugget of wisdom! Harassment is not cool. Stop harassing people because you think you're entitled to something out of their control.
I'd like to apologize to anyone who had tried to send me email thru my website, apparently my email form isn't working. Gah!
For those of you not after badges, I have several return Sketch Cards. Perna cards are $90US. I have CMII, Spellcasters, CFT. CDN at par.

If you need a badge for @fureh or another con, I'm doing them for $25. Will be laminated. Includes shipping. http://t.co/ZPUUhI6y3s
I won't be selling art at @fureh if I go because I don't know if I have that weekend off work. So! Look for the blue bear if I can make it.
HONEY, WHERE ARE MY PANTS? http://t.co/uZYTlddw2N
Wisdom nugget: Sometimes guests cancel conventions. Is it disappointing? Yes. Don't be a jerk to the con, though. It's not their fault.
DUDE. We may get thunderstorms today *dances*
Today's nugget of wisdom: Keep working at that painting, because eventually you'll get past the 'OMFG I HATE IT' phase and get to awesome.
Classic Fairy Tales cards! I did these for the Pernas. Hooray!
How I'm spending my Friday afternoon. @hayleyerza http://t.co/JKiy67hOgZ

I'd like to go on the record as saying that after being in a cast for almost 10 weeks, that first bath is amaaaaaaaazing.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! http://t.co/mbse4alW4v
Today thus cast should be gone, and that wiimote will be off the floor. Also, Lego! http://t.co/u3wQ1BmMix
Today's nugget of wisdom: if you think a convention's anti harassment policy is preventing you from getting a date, you're doing it wrong.
So I realized I hadn't drawn Dead Bird Head Guy in about a decade. So here he is in all of his sassy glory. http://t.co/eomnYXxTcv
Happy Easter! http://t.co/MEeJjljtUy
2016 marks 20 years since I left Australia. Did you know I'm a dual Aussie/Canuck citizen?
I'm going to try my best to do #CalgaryExpo in 2016 as my sole con, the rest of my vacation time will be going to an Australian holiday.
I've had a bunch of people ask, but no I won't be at either #StarWarsCelebration or #CalgaryExpo this year. The stars just didn't line up.
