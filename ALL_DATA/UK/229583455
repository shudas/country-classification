Girls don't have any morals anymore
Loved these two weeks off
Let the stress begin
Cannot cope with life right now
Ive just had the best salad ever 😍
I'm so impatient
I do love my job
I fall in love with cute cartoon animals far too quickly
Starting to get frustrated so fucking easy
Chewable tablets are disgusting 😷
I love my brother so much
I can see who comes first now☺️ #forgottenabout
Fuck off you cunt
I really need to stop throwing things when I get angry

Bad hair day
It's ridiculous how bad I look for college, morning are just not my thing
Regret leaving jakes but need to get this college work done 😔😩
I've had one night off work and I miss it 😂
Need my eye brows doing, need a tan, my hair needs some tlc... Just no money
Jake washes his car too much
I could look nice if I wanted too but I really just cba
Can't wait to get my nails done later
So behind on college work but don't have the motivation to do any of it

I fucking love pot noodles
I love food programmes

You're so weird now 😂😂😂 embarrasing
Fucking iMessages aren't sending
No plans abbie
All I do now a days is sleep and work
Fuming

Such a good unexpected drunken weekend
Being this tired is not healthy
My eye lids have swollen up making me feel even more tired 😩
Hmmm...
Happy Christmas🎄🎁🎉
Spoilt by jakes family 😍🎄🎁
Really not in the fucking mood.
Doctors on Christmas Eve is not what I wanted
Need someone to rant too
So much anger building up 😡😠
So much on my mind and seems like a new problem is adding to it everyday
Mum, dad, Ben and jake are going to my fave restraunt whilst I'm stuck at work
