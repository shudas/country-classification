Iv'e been with my wife for 25 years. Apparently this means I have to take her out to dinner.
The liver punishment has ceased and I feel well rested/slightly hung over. If anyone needs me I'll be in the bottom of a pot of coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è

Are you fucking kidding me? Sometimes living in Colorado sucks...
10 shots of espresso in 4 hours and all I have to show for it is a really shaky hand. I'm no more energized than I was before. Boo. Hiss.

I cannot wait until next weekend. I'm going to visit a friend in Denver and punishing my liver and brain in new and unusual ways.
Someone please give me an interesting job that pays well in either, San Francisco, Boston or Maine. Thanks in advance.

Can it be September? I'm jonesing here. #PatsNation
Note to self. Do NOT fall asleep with your TENS machine on and an evil 14 year old in the house. Little bastard fried me.
Me: I'm sorry, you need a placard to use that space. 
Him: No crips need it right now. I'll fuckin move later. 
Me: You'll move now.
So, I dislocated my right shoulder today. I'm not gonna lie Marge, it hurt. Putting it back in was even more fun. Who needs doctors? Feh!
Neeeerrrrrrrds! http://t.co/13UxUYYpuJ
Yes, it's 1:00 am. Yes, I am watching cartoons and yes, there is a box of thin mint cookies on my side table. I'm an adult. Bite me.
Ye gods and little fishes...3 new tires in 2 weeks. Thanks heaps @ColoradoDOT. My wallet was getting too heavy anyway. #potholes
Pinning all my hopes on a rescue disk I ordered on Amazon. If it doesn't work I've lost nearly 15000 songs and a few hundred pictures. Argh.

Can't wait for my @VaporSkunk Trio to arrive! üòÅ
Waiting for #Castle to come on &amp; forced to watch the last few minutes of Dancing w/ the stars. Terrible rendition of Take me to church. Ag.
Watching M*A*S*H and drinking Soju. Seems appropriate.
I've been informed that, if I wish to wear my #Patriots gear next September in the very heart of Packers country, I'd better bulk up.

Huh...Cubs lost. Color me shocked. Welp, maybe next time guys.
I've been trying desperately to stop being negative. Life however, seems to keep giving me reasons. Damn life, with your problems and stuff.
You guys!! 3rd rock from the sun is on @netflix! It's really hard to be sad watching @JohnLithgow being a Dick....
Wow! Honored to be followed by @theoduscrane. My daughter will be jealous.
I know everyone has seen this but, it still tickles me so. http://t.co/RL7VDivYD2
I'm standing on a stage of fear and self doubt. It's a hollow play but they'll clap anyway.
Ok, it's late and the 6 melatonin are kicking in. Night all. May cooler heads prevail.
Rioting only draws negative attention and removes any sympathy toward the cause. #Ferguson #ActYourAge
More riots in Ferguson? For fucks sake people. Get your shit together. Act like adults and stop looking for reasons to be shitty. #Ferguson
Try as I might, I just can't get into basketball. Needs to be September again. #ReadyForSomeFootball

Cannot find my stupid vista ultimate disk. Laptop won't boot and the boy used my music backup flash drive for his fucking Xbox. Shitballs.
Mellow greetings. What seems to be your boggle? #DemolitionMan
Dreamt I was back home in Marin last night. Sitting in Cafe Trieste on Bridgeway drinking espresso. I may need to make a trip back soon.
Sooo...The snapshot thing from @Progressive may have jacked up the computer in my car. I say may have because I'm not 100% certain yet.
Had to go back to my hotel because some drunken fuckweed put a whole, frozen chicken in the microwave and set off the fire alarm. Asshole.
Last bit of @Patriots swag delivered. Woot! http://t.co/fVOga5jzZ4

There needs to be a Starbucks in the jury room. With blackjack and hookers.

I'm thinking I need to hit up the gyro place after they finish with the car. Fat boy needs food.
Well, could've been worse. $360 for 2 tires....fuck.
And then, this happened. Thanks @springsgov for your wonderful roads. The potholes are lovely and numerous. http://t.co/TZIiTEZBcI
