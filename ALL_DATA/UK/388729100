Loved Natalie bennett's answer to the immigration question. #BBCDebate
I like what I've seen of Leanne Wood. People seem to sneer at her for slightly mysterious and probably unsavoury reasons. #BBCDebate
"I would disagree mainly with my friend on the far right there." #BBCDebate
Welp. This is awkward. http://t.co/N94abyjkg8
"We must recognise the decisions our govt have made in the past to make the world a less safe place." Yes Leanne Wood #BBCDebate
Literally, that is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. He's like an oversensitive unpopular child. #BBCDebate
Farage is crying 'left-wing audience' bc audience don't like him, and dimbles just slapped him into the middle of next week #BBCDebate
Farage just got booed for saying immigrants are behind housing problems. G'wan studio audience! #BBCDebate
GUYS YOU KNOW IF YOU SAY THE QUESTIONER'S NAME REPEATEDLY IT DOESN'T MAKE US LOVE YOU RIGHT? #BBCDebate
Sturgeon is beating miliband to a pulp. #BBCDebate
Heh. Farage expected wild applause there and didn't get any and it was awkward. #BBCDebate
"I think that people should vote for parties who would hold labour to account and make them bolder." Clever. #BBCDebate
"Blah blah Hadrian's wall blah blah". Love how Sturgeon is just chuckling at Farage. "That's right lad, help us in." #BBCDebate
Charlotte is not right. #BBCDebate
"Charlotte, you're right." Don't pander to the young Tory, ed. #BBCdebate
I would ruin lives for this ice cream. My life, your life, who cares.
On a whim, bought a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry's 'What-a-lotta-chocolate cookie core'. Crap name but my god, if Walter White made ice cream...
Another beautiful day in Cardiff. I'm getting freaked out now. It's like when a mean person is being really nice &amp; you're just.not.sure.why.
I'll take the silence as endorsement. #OneWayToDoTwitter
Pretty sure The Beautiful South's 'The Root of All Evil' is the best song ever written about the Euro.
This weather, though. Roath is on a permanent sun high. Everyone was chatting in the park.
First picnic of the year was, as they say, 'lush'. http://t.co/kAciGV2Y2U
So witty! Think I'll vote Tory now. https://t.co/t7pDkO3v59
(It's being billed as by 'unbiased academics' in some tweets which I'm not sure is wise. But we know what they mean. Not Guardian/Mail)
Essential reading for later from @TheConversation: academics scrutinise party manifestos. https://t.co/UPAzNnTHj8
It's not though, is it? http://t.co/6z6UD9FXW7
What. Just what. Even for a Tory this is repulsive.  http://t.co/jqoWHVkqQU
Sure @CardiffBookHist will keep you updated, if you're disposed to follow along. #WISE
Battery going to die imminently, but looking fwd to Damian Walford-Davies's talk abt the politics/ethics of editing, next up #WISE
'The Triumph of Life' (1822) one of the most problematic Shelley poems to edit, says O'Neill #WISE
O'Neill underlines importance of Ozymandias's original publication in The Examiner - poss editorial traces from Leigh Hunt #WISE
O'Neill reading 'Ozymandias' (to remind us that we're talking abt literature). Nearly as good as this version: https://t.co/0oMfNpzDuP #WISE
O'Neill: Does the editor have a right (or a duty) to carry out an evaluative critical function when editing? #WISE
Now Michael O'Neill (Durham) 'Editing P.B.Shelley' (for as long as my battery lasts) #WISE
Quick break, then case studies on editing Shelley and Wordsworth. #WISE
.@gregg_sh finishes up with overview of Text Creation Partnership: creating electronic editions of early books. http://t.co/7yizPQB9UE #WISE
.@gregg_sh: "XML gives you a chance to hold variants in stasis" - don't have to make a choice between diff variants in diff editions #WISE
Online editions sometimes use hyperlinks, says @gregg_sh: what does it do to the text when you force the reader to 'jump in &amp; out'? #WISE
Great overviews of online editions of some texts by Behn and Defoe, prepared by @gregg_sh 's students. #WISE
Quoting @samplereality, @gregg_sh posits that digital humanities is about challenging ways that knowledge is represented &amp; shared.
Starts with Aaron Swartz quote: "It's not OK not to understand the internet anymore." Heh heh. Also, eeeeeep.
In @gregg_sh's case study, he showcases his students' projects to show challenges &amp; opportunities of digital editing.
Great tips from Jane Winters about issues &amp; tools to consider when planing an edition. Next up: @gregg_sh on 'Digital pedagogy &amp; editing'
Importance of using XML editors rather than Word: Jane recommends TEI http://t.co/Yy5X6am1u0 and Oxygen http://t.co/GtLcvAN9lb as tools
Importance of establishing robust file-naming and version control practices at the outset of preparing an edition. Oh god, I can imagine.
Jane directs us to this @britishacademy guide to copyright &amp; academic research - just what I was looking for! http://t.co/QXR9wRlTKV
(As well as giving us a scholarly overview of the importance of facsimile editions in the digital age, obv)
First session: 'editing medieval and early modern source texts'. Jane Winters (IHR) is showing us medieval illustrations of lolbeasts.
Day 2 of What Is Scholarly Editing (WISE) training. Yesterday covered different editorial principles: today's about practical methodologies
Morning! Off to learn abt editing critical editions today at @CardiffBookHist's WISE workshops. Hoping it'll help with a V Exciting Project.
Marking station http://t.co/SgsDGyVIbW
Morning, everyone. Hope you have considerably less marking to do today, and considerably more rolling around in the sun, than I.
Omg, gene hackman's rogue NSA agent character is even CALLED Edward #EnemyOfTheState
Jack Black also in the house doing 'obnoxious geek nerd', which i actually think he does rather well
And Seth Green wearing yellow sunglasses to signal that he's a geek nerd
Also Anna Gunn is in it, looking v radiant
Will Smith = pre-Edward Snowden Edward Snowden? #bitofastretch
Enemy Of The State: one of few late 90s summer blockbusters that's held up surprisingly well. (HT @welprich for making this observation)
I was all sad that @welprich was making me watch Michael Fallon's speech on defence, but now the media are roasting him &amp; it's fun
I really like the way he keeps brandishing/caressing his father's sword while he talks
They should have to stare erotically at their opposite numbers at close range AFTER the race. #boatrace2015
And Cambridge aren't challenging? Ah for a bit of controversy. I miss Trenton Oldfield. And that huge crab from last year. #boatrace2015
Well done oxford. And Constantine Louloudis, who can now get back in his cryogenic box til next year #boatrace2015
Ah man, the cameras are having trouble fitting them in again. "This race is easily comprehensible" says Pinsent, kindly. #boatrace2015
'Now he's stroking his crew' #boatrace2015
I always like CoxCam. Good nostril view. #boatrace2015
*joke about catching crabs* #boatrace2015
I am enjoying this 'rival male rowers walk down the staircase &amp; stare erotically into each others' eyes' thing #boatrace2015
Oxford won. #twist #boatrace2015
It's got to the point where the camera is finding it hard to keep both boats in shot. #boatrace2015
"Let's look on the bright side here, it's a gorgeous day". Commentators doing a great job of not just giving up &amp; going home. #boatrace2015
This is pretty brutal. Oxford could just let a couple of the rowers take a break. Have a gin. Cheeky nap. #boatrace2015
GO ON OXFORD WITH YOUR CARYN DAVIES DIGGING DEEP I'm just saying words #boatrace2015
MONTAGE! They're nearly off! #boatrace2015
Ah, the vox pops are just as adorably inane regardless of gender &lt;3 #boatrace2015
"Anastasia Chitty." That is a name I shall wrap carefully in brain tissue &amp; take out one day to use in a novel. #boatrace2015
"We just accepted: they got the publicity and we didn't. They got the sponsorship and we didn't." #boatrace2015
These reminisces from women rowers past are moving and also profoundly depressing #boatrace2015
I think they forgot to tell us who won the 'all-important toss'. #boatrace2015
Oooh. It's the 'all-important toss'. Settle down. #boatrace2015
Boat Race Fact: Constantine Louloudis has been rowing in the boat race since 1923 #boatrace2015
Here they all are, looking like cornfed chickens #boatrace2015
I mean, it's obviously good and I can see why everyone's chuffes. But isn't it daft that it took this long #boatrace2015
Mmf. Kinda ridiculous that it's 2015 and we're congratulating ourselves on letting women row the same course as men #boatrace2015
I know you're all going to mock me for loving the boat race, it's fine. Mock away. I have gin, and beautiful muscular physiques to watch.
Tools down, gins up. Boat race time! (This year, feat. gender equality.) http://t.co/u1OFGKjN6R
But for the 1770s/1790s. With more wigs and less meth.
So my latest thing is studying how Vince Gilligan manages the Gus Fring/cartel backstory in Breaking Bad &amp; trying to clumsily ape his genius
That moment when you realise that 5 or 6 of your main characters have a bloody BACKSTORY. In the 1770s. Mmmfffgghh.
