For those of you who thought it might have changed, it hasn't. LAX sucks!!!!
Spent time with the amazing @Jimcummingsacme today! If u know him as Winnie AND Tigger, wait til u hear him as Edsy in #AnimalCrackerz!
Oh man, that was funny.
Do I drink almond milk lattes? Yes. Does that make me feel good about myself? Not particularly.
What's the policy on favoriting my own tweets?
Heading to Cali to voice record #AnimalCrackerz. Looking 4ward to being mocked for "Z" in title. Being mocked for "Zed" was getting old.

Can we all admit that my haircut makes me look like I'm the guy who's told old to be at the Morrissey concert? http://t.co/qDU2WryPzr
Haircut in 3 minutes. But I am at least 8 minutes away. Barber squeezed me in. Now he is pissed. Prediction: bad haircut in near future.
Being in a plane is like being inside the world's biggest can of fart spray. Seriously people, carve out some xtra time on flight morning.

In cool news I am allowed to talk about, Animal Crackerz is psyched to have Marcelo Quinonez @CANICAMUSIC onboard as composer! Welcome man!
In other exciting news, all 3 of my kids now poop in potty. Amazing how each generation really does exceed achievements of the previous.
All sorts of exciting news on Animal Crackerz casting front! And I may even be allowed to talk about it this week! Stay tuned...

Dear retailers: if u were true partners in this global deception, you'd make it a little easier to take the friggin' price tags off!!!

On the plus side: forecast is for white Xmas up here in Oakville, Ontario. On less plus side: it's gonna be -17 tonight. Good luck, Santa!
