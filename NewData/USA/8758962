I'm really sad thar whenever @Ryggeryx hears Taylor Swift he thinks of me. That's most definitely not the image I've been working on.
I'll be 33 in a couple weeks. I'm still childless and unwed. You guys should just send a bunch of cats.
I don't feel well today. It's amazing to me that I'm actually able to call in sick. It was absolutely impossible to do at my old job.

I absolutely cannot handle adulting today.
Just had a costumer scream at me for nothing within my control. I busrst into tears and she feel like an asshole, like she should.

I'm teaching my mom how to IKEA and it is fun as hell.
Ugh. 

Quit saying epic.
Kinda drunk with @Emilyosis and we're listening to music from high school. We've already knocked out the spice girls and the pure moods CD
Who has haters over the age of 30, cause you know you gotta shake, sake, shake it off...

God...I give up
Too many whiskies and I erased ALL the music on my phone! I may be inconsolable.
For some reason KMFDM has been on the edge of my awareness all day. like 4 social media references in one day.
