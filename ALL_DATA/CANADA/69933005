Edmonton really needs a store that sells tea party attire.
I can't believe how happy I am that the Flames won a playoff game.
I put on my @TheoFleury14 tshirt and a minute later they scored. Just saying #GoFlamesGo
These fans are going to rage if the Hawks score here
This Blackhawks/Preds game is so fun to watch. I love playoff hockey!!!!
I really hope the Penguins can surprise us all.
Seriously so excited for the playoffs to start!
Anyone know why Fasth didn't start tonight? #Oilers #EDMvsVAN
Okay Oilers, finish the season with a W! #EDMvsVAN
Can the game just end right now?
I like how Roots has the #BOSvsTBL score in the corner of the screen. Thanks Roots LetsGoPens
No matter what happens I'll be cheering just as hard for you next October as I will be tonight. Love you, Penguins #LetsGoPens
Did the Rangers even try though?
On the bright side, Crosby got 2 more points to add to his scoring lead #PositiveThinking
Longest period in life #LetsGoPens
Gross.
Twitter updates me faster than any sports app. Thank you Pens Friends #LetsGoPens
It's taco/Pens win Tuesday #LetsGoPens
Hammond is 17-1-2?? Oh. My. God. I'm officially scurred over here. #LetsGoPens
What is with this music? #ableg #abvote
I have never been more of a Leafs fan than I was today. Thank you Leafs. I will not hate you again until next season, I promise.
Honestly can't wait until this season is over.
The Penguins might actually not make the playoffs. How is this real life?
I'm officially scared #Pens
Of course the game goes to OT #WSHvsOTT
Pens are tanking for McDavid, right?
Now if only Washington and Ottawa could both lose tonight #Pens
For real this time, I'm never speeding again.
I can't even bring myself to make an Oilers joke. It's just too sad.
Hockey scares me.
I hate these goddamn commentators. Do not scream ssscccoore when the visiting team scores. Eff you. #LetsGoPens
Crosby with his 300th goal. Beauty #LetsGoPens
A thunderstorm on my birthday? It's like Mother Nature knows #ThankYou
+16 today and up to 4cm of snow tomorrow. Never change, Alberta. Never change #yeg #yegweather
My dog took it upon herself to pierce my other dogs ear so I've missed the last hour of the roast. Thanks a lot Brooklyn.
Shaq is giving to the Biebs. Love it. #BieberRoast
Fuck I wish Jeselnik was here #BieberRoast
I actually would have loved to see Lisa Lampanelli up there #BieberRoast
Bieber looks so uncomfortable up there #BieberRoast
Omg @petedavidson is amazing #BieberRoast
Sorry Oilers, I have to turn it to the #BieberRoast
Last year I was lucky enough to spend my birthday in Pittsburgh/Boston. This year I'm stuck in Edmonton. Next year I'm coming back #MissIt
Amazing. What a kill #Pens
Come on Sharks, let's be serious, you're not making the playoffs. Give us the win you sons of bitches #LetsGoPens
Yay Kunitz!!!!!! I've missed your goals!! #LetsGoPens
Minus the Bruins winning, today has been a good day for hockey.
This hurts my heart so much #Letang #Pens
I miss when they used to score goals #LetsGoPens
I am in tears. This is so beautiful &lt;3
What kind of garbage person would create an app that is used to post hurtful things about people #BurnBook #cyberbullying #Gross
Remember TV guides?
Are people seriously sending Tokarski hate tweets? Be mad at him all you want but don't tweet hateful things to him. So gross.
I need to go for a walk to calm down #Pens
Holy Engellend!
Unfuckingbelievable #Pens
Lol Borts. Not even mad right now #LetsGoPens
