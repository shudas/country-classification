If my flight goes missing this morning make sure @kobebryant is at my funeral.
Sydney, we're coming for you.

#Memphis do not look like giving up this game.
Anthony Davis won the season series over the Thunder with a Double-Clutch 3 Pointer, sending them to the playoffs. #NBAFacts #NeverForget
ANTHONY DAVIS SAYS 'FUCK NO!' #PELICANS
Perhaps the #Pelicans should Hack-A-Parker. #ClutchMisses
Hack-An-Asik underway in New Orleans. Pop wants the W but I want to Pelicans in the playoffs, who will prevail... #NBADDay
I've had three green tree frogs since I was a child and my longest surviving has just passed away. #RIPMyChildhood
My girlfriend just rolled over in bed half asleep and whispered to me 'they're all dead.' Smiled. Then went back to sleep. #OhDearGod
So now that Essendon have been found not guilty, do we have to play the 2013 AFL Finals all over again? #AFLQuestions
Those lazy afternoons. #Holidays http://t.co/iw84cN8MA1
A week from now will mark 25 years since my birth. My greatest achievement, I feel, is never having been dunked on in that time. #Life
It is. Dear god.
Is #ChildSupport a hastag?

M8 nor sober.
I'm not not really really drunk. #Holidays

Welp. http://t.co/ivIzXH3sV0
#MoanaMovieTrip apparently.
Moana. We're coming for you. #DrinkDrankDrunk
#BirdInternet
It's #Holidays guys! Get your bets into how much alcohol I can/will consume in the next 2 weeks.
Last day off work before 2 weeks off. #NotTooBad
Yawnin' all mornin'.
I swear to god, what 'he did next' was hold her hand. Fuck off Woman's Day. Fuck off. #AreYouKiddingMeWithThisShit http://t.co/FQd3Jz65uo
I had no idea how fucked the Australian Dollar was before I ordered my Jordans. Oh well, I've earned this, I hope.
And so on.
Track Pants.
Pillow Forts.
Tin Rooves.
Electric Blankets.
All the best things (there are very few) about #Winter involve two words.
Basketball.
Particularly when they decided to stick a man on me all game. #YouCantGuardMe
I missed 2 shots tonight. I am extremely pleased with that. 18 points on 6/8 shooting. #Holdat
I have a game myself incoming, need pull of something big with our Centre out. Need to pull a #TownsTooBig.
#DukeAllTheWay #StillHappening
MUSHROOM, MUSHROOM. #NCAAChampionship
I didn't have a #PerfectBracket but I had #Duke to win it all. That counts, right?
IT'S ALL OVER FOLKS! THE #DUKEBLUEDEVILS ARE THE #NCAACHAMPIONS!
#DUKE ARE GOING TO DO IT!
All tied at Halftime. This matchup deserved nothing less. #NCAAChampionship
You can't let the #Badgers back in, you just can't do it. Pull it together #Duke.
#Duke out to the biggest lead of the game. #NCAAChampionship
Hand Down. Man Down. #DukeBlueDevils #NCAAChampionship
If there is one thing #Duke should have taken away from the last #Wisconsin game it's to get a hand on every short by Frank Kaminsky.
Duke with the first score on the board. Go you good thing. #NCAAChampionship
Five minutes guys. Five minutes. #DukeBlueDevils #NCAAChampionship
This will be the sixth time Duke have done it in mine and the second I'm going to be old enough to remember. #DukeBlueDevils #BringItHome
There's only a 24% chance of you seeing your #NCAATournament team play in a National Championship in your LIFETIME.
Nothing but lifelong memories and a National Championship to their name. #WorthIt
Just one hour until tipoff! #AllDukeAllDay
It's extremely cold and raining outside but my dog decides to brave it and sleep in his kennel without complaint. #PuppyAppreciationPost
How I feel about having to work tomorrow even though my #DukeBlueDevils made the #NCAATournament Championship Game. http://t.co/yizwsuOU6J
#Eastbay order going in, anyone after anything?
We live in a society where #Firefly was cancelled after one season but Paul Blart Mall Cop got a sequel...
Another Dwight in a #Lakers uniform. Let's see if this kid can find some productivity.
Nothing has changed. #WelcomeBackPaulGeorge
So the big question is. What number will Towns wear with the #Lakers? #NCAATournament
That ought to do it. Bring on Tuesday. Bring on a Blue and White win. #BlueDevilNation #NCAATournament
#Kentucky in a tough spot. Might be all #Duke on Tuesday. Now how do I get off work? #NCAATournament
Whilst this timeout is underway. In other sports news: If the Crows lose today I wont be tipping them again in tight contests. #AFL
The referees are trying to even up the game now with some ridiculous calls going  to #Kentucky. #FinalFour
#TownsTooBig
Still potential for there to be a hell of a lot of Blue and White in the #NationalChampionship game.
The refs have lost control of this game. #NCAA #FinalFour
If the #Badgers do win here. (Which I'm still not cheering for). It'll make watching the Final more intense. All #BlueDevils All Day.
That jam by Lyles. I'd have two broken wrists. #Kentucky #FinalFour
So far the refs have missed an out of bounds call, a travel and a flop. All favouring the #Badgers. Kentucky wont lie down though. #NCAA
This is going to be one hell of a game. Biggest game of the year thus far. #Lakers tank plan should include eyeing in on Towns. #Kentucky
Andrew triple to get us underway! Followed by a jam! #Kentucky #GetBuckets
Ball is up. #NCAA #FinalFour
Startin' the hashtag early. #TownsTooBig
Hold onto your hats. Here come the Cats. #NCAA #FinalFour
The #Badgers want revenge. They want to make this an upset to rememeber. The #Wildcats need to stay composed and keep doin' their thing.
The statistical chances of someone being alive to see their two #NCAA teams in the Finals would have to be 1 in an extremely big number.
The #BlueDevils are through! Bring on the #Wildcats!
Gilles Plains are building a brand new Dan Murphys. They must know @JD_Thornhill is on his way.
1 - 1 in #AFL tipping. Still a better percentage than any #Lakers big man today.
The city is a fucking ghost town right now. http://t.co/idDA6XYjaU
Jess has a virus on her computer so bad it's no longer a virus, it's more like the black plague.
You can't watch Chimps for more than 5 minutes without understanding that evolution is real.
GIRAFFE! http://t.co/sdJcZXWvIZ
ZEBRA. http://t.co/f276uQSyKQ
HE JUST BARKED, HE'S MAKING BIG DECISIONS.
There's a puppy at my work today and it's in the managers meeting, it's moving up faster than I am. #WorkLife
If Jesus really cared about us working class he would have stayed in that cave an extra 11 months. #11MonthLongWeekend
Blake is a unit tonight. 40 points and a double double. #GSWvLAC
Cheerin' on the @Warriors just 'cause I know it'll make @Chrisgillard01 a happy man.
