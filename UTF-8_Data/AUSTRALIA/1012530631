Does anyone know where I can get a pair of @NRL_Bulldogs bikinis? Im sure i saw some a yr or 2 back @NRLBulldogsFans #proudtobeabulldog
Oh no theres not an app now. Its a web based application, hence why they called it an app. Becoming more dismayed each time i talk to them
Finally sorted out that i cant get points for sharing posts from @NRL_Bulldogs facebook page. Only from #dogsofreWARds app. Cant find app?
