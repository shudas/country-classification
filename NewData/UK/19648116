I'm watching this warm and cosy in my bed, and that makes me happy #TheIslandWithBearGrylls
#Wildthings amazing trash.
This is proper stressful. #OrdinaryLies
Those flowers ain't gonna survive the plane journey love #HolbyCity
If I woke up from a coma and found out that my bloody boyfriend had been shagging my sister I'd be slightly peeved. #EastEnders
Nicely done, Brendan! #coachtrip
Is there any point in watching #TheAvengersAgeOfUltron next week if there is no #Loki in it?
Why must everyone have affairs?! #eastenders
Sweet #AntManTrailer #PaulRudd http://t.co/iqfPlAvYky
Good on you, Jon Snow #GameOfThronesSeason5
Or should I save it all up for a binge watch? So hard to decide... #GameOfThronesSeason5
#gameofthrones Day is HERE
I'll do it. http://t.co/G9a4tdlKqd #sleep
I think I may have a #pretamanger problem. http://t.co/KAenWHUpOo
WHERE IS SILENT JAY?  #gogglebox
This film would be better with #jackbauer #OlympusHasFallen
Which is better? #OlympusHasFallen or #whitehousedown...  aka the one with @channingtatum
Best beginning of a film ever #raidersofthelostark
If you think too much about #big, it's gross.
Question. How many #pretamanger are there in #London? Infinity and beyond. Yum.
That hotel manager is a bit full on #TheAmericans
When your boyfriend tells you 'you're cute when you toot', it must be love. #farting

Tempted to save the last few episodes of #TheAmericans so I don't have to wait another week!
This may be my favourite #shaunthesheep so far. #shauninthecity #London http://t.co/bmPe64VMay
En route to #London with @TheBumCat to see #shauninthecity #sunny #holiday #Aardman
The only reason I know the #TurnDownForWhat song is because I love cats.

Aw, that moved me to tears. Poor girl... How can parents disown their child for being gay? Horrible #firstdates
