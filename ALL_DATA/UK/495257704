Seeing the teacher I always had a crush on was definitely the highlight of my night 😍
You know you're fugly when even the filter used at Hector's House can't make you look good 😩😂
Tonight was unexpected but so much fun
You know you're a student when you use a hairdryer to dry clothes 😩
Correction my worst fears are true, they are both in the flat and left this out on the counter http://t.co/pqyT9NPYAE
I personally loved that tweet
Which for some reason is out of the reach of so many people
Not impressed with @ASOS one bit 🙅🏾
Was hoping I would have the place to myself
Fml, at least one of the twats is in 😫😭😫😭
Not that I don't like him or think his music isn't good but...every single one of Kygo's songs sounds so similar it's unreal
Just hoping my flat is empty for the week, don't think I could deal with getting back and finding out those two rats and there 😩
Back to Edinburgh tomorrow morning and it's not a moment too soon
Nothing annoys me more than updates to apps that makes them worse than before 🙅🏽
Need to be back in Edinburgh swear I'm having withdrawal symptoms 😫
Went for the cutest dinner with mumma bear today, introduced her to the wonder that is @wagamama_uk and she is converted 🙌
Started watching videos on YouTube at half past 11 look up and it's nearly 2 😴😭😭
Missing the burgh already
I think the point at which you realise your alarm will go off in 36 minutes is when you acknowledge you're not sleeping tonight
Love how easily persuaded @HannahDall1 is to come out 😂
Some guys really are just absolute pigs 😷
Probs won't actually drop kick them but just shout quite a bit
Gonna drop kick whichever flat mate I see first absolute cunts 😡
Can't put my headphones in because I've just got my tragus pierced and it hurts too much 😭😭
Pretending I'm in control of my life and uni work
Why why why, literally the only half decent program ever broadcast by the bbc has been ruined 😭
Keysurf is the bane of my life
My mother is honestly such a busy body 😳
If you're the one coordinating this you need to be fired
Beyond hate my brother right now
Getting some much needed vitamin d 🌞
That dominos was heaven sent
Feel like I should be at nursery not university with the amount of naps that I take
Hangovers that creep up on you during the day 😷
So excited to go out tonight ☺️
So bored its unreal right now 😭
Today is gonna be a good day
So excited to go out for lunch today 🍔🍹
Every time they test the fire alarm I still have an heart attack 📣😫
Some people never cease to amaze me
Feel ill every time I walk into central and see the pigeons 😷
Just want to curl up in a ball and sleep for about a year
Finally watching @FiftyShades with @HannahDall1
My grandparents are the most amazing people in the while wide world and I fucking love them to pieces 👴👵❤️
The only reason I'm making this hell hole of a 9am is because I've done the work 😩
Just want cuddled
Sorry but why the fuck is it snowing?!?! 🙅
So excited to go out tonight it's unreal
Mind is spinning, don't know what to think

Preach 👏 zendaya's photo http://t.co/BtZ1vnP4ih
About to launch my phone at a wall if I don't get a reply soon

I'm being clingy and want to talk to you
Not!! Reply to my fucking text please
I love being ignored, does me wonders
I just want a cuddle 😩
Honestly don't think I could be happier right now 😊
I just want the cleaner to leave so I can have a shower please 😭
Really want to go to the carnival in Trinidad and Tobago one year
Accepting defeat and realising that this exam today is going to be a total waste of time
Genuinely despise my tutorials
Please just fuck off out of my life once and for all and let me move on
What the fuck just happened to me
My excitement for the sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird" cannot be put into words
Next three hours are going to be so grim
Never been so confused in all my life after waking up from that impromptu nap
Hen shut your mouth
Genuinely want to drop out of uni right now 😢😢😢
Cannot wait to move in to my new flat with the best friends ever ⏳
Flat mates actually do my head in, seriously fuck off you pretentious cunts
And uni work
Still feeling like I'm getting my life together though, got up early to do laundry
Doing my laundry in last nights makeup and feeling classy as ever
Glasgow Central is not a good place to be if you're scared of pigeons 😷
Genuinely think I've broken my foot again, can't walk 😢
Bored beyond all belief
Absolutely craving teviot nachos 😭😭
Eye candy in my tutorial has brightened up my day no end
Appleton tower gives me the fear
I forgot, because you're so unique and individual compared to the rest of society
Genuinely feel like death
Why is it teenage school boys can be so intimidating...
You're nothing but a piece of shit incase I hadn't already told you
And I have no dignity left
Dropping my phone in my dinner isn't the smartest thing I've done
Not fair
Fuck off
And why is everyone passing their driving test
Remembering the conversations I had last night and cringe no longer even covers it
Having only one lecture really does make your day
Jesus Christ what did I do last night 😲😫😫😫😫
Don't understand this turning up to lectures with like 15 minutes to go
So so poor right now
Like we haven't seen each other in 9 months haven't spoken in 3 and now you want to meet up 😐
Slightly surreal feeling right now
I can actually feel my house shaking a wee bit with this wind 😕
You haven't spoken to me since September and now you text me?
Took a burst with 110 photos plus all the others, why is he my brother... http://t.co/6yfIB86g4e
Genuinely considering hauling all my stuff back to Edinburgh tomorrow
Either going to end up getting another piercing or a tattoo next week, can't decide
Two more days till I'm free again
Checking your bank balance after a shopping spree is enough to give anyone a heart attack 💔
Retail therapy sure is the best kind of therapy
Think I fancy you just a wee bit 😍
Mum's bitching about me to one of her pals but she's taking in Yoruba so I can't understand her 😭😠😭😤
Brother had keys on him, still makes me get out a bath to open the door for him 😡
Don't appreciate waking up at past 5
Feeling hella sassy... http://t.co/ddyDYDs2ia
So puma haven't yet sorted out this zip...😂😩😂
You are a bit of an embarrassment
Arsene Wenger letting @Podolski10 go even just on loan is the second biggest mistake he's made...behind not playing him in the first place!
Too tall for petite dresses, too short for normal ones 😭😤
Am I genuinely the only person who likes bounty's?
And by home I mean Edinburgh
I want to go home
Educate yourselves ignorant people
And you're not contagious until you have symptoms
Ebola is not airborne you stupid fucks

Imagine having a child at this age...
I would quite happily go back to Edinburgh tomorrow
Don't know how I'm going to survive the next two weeks
Finished season 2 of Sherlock (bit late) but I'm now sat here crying
At least if it's not online
Genuinely hate shopping

New compare the market ad just made me well up...
Christmas Eve carol service 🎅🎄🎁🔔⛪️ http://t.co/qL8orMtSaP
4th Christmas in a row that my dad's been working on Christmas Day 😠
Christmas on my own at this moment is preferable
At this precise moment I would genuinely walk back to Edinburgh, hate being back here
If only they knew
Currently feeling quite smug 🌚
Awkward when you can't tell if someone's mixed race or just covered in fake tan 👀
I miss Edinburgh 😢
Don't know if I should call that a dream or a hallucination
Ahahaha, what is that
Today has been a good day
Tired of your drama already
