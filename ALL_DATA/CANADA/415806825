Dishes are done. I must've dozed off while I'm watching YouTube vids. Might as well hit the hay.
Time for new episode of @RemedySeries. Happy Remedy Night!!!
It's Monday, that means new episode of @RemedySeries tonight.
In my treadmill until 2:10pm. Fettuccine Alfredo for supper. I'm feeling fresh after having rough depression days.
Done writing my journal about commit suicide. I'm glad I stayed alive.
I'm thinking about staying off #Facebook until April 12th...I should be back on April 13th...Dunno when...who knows?
Just getting home from Espo safe and sound. The snowstorm is here. Drive carefully y'all. Old man winter is not going anywhere.
At the Espanola Mall with Auntie Reg, Da Chef, and Granny.
After my friends accept my apology all over social media about hurting my feelings, I just wanna stay friends forever.
Writing apology letter to my friends and music buddies on Facebook helps me about not committing suicide. Hope they'll forgive me.
I'm thinking about writing another apology letter on my Facebook on April 1st about killing myself. I'm a changed man. The old me is gone.
As soon I'm re-activate my Facebook account on April 1st, I refuse to accept Patricia J. Restoule's apology about me committing suicide.
So, I'm gonna re-open my Facebook sometime on April 1st.
I'm thinking about re-open my Facebook sometime next week. I'm just gonna cool myself down after good night's sleep.
And again, I'm very sorry to my friends all over social media about what's wrong with me about committing suicide. Please forgive me.
My former Bestie was right, I don't need a counsellor. Patricia J. Restoule is not my Facebook friend anymore, cause she's rude. I h8 her.
I wanna apologize to everybody all over social media about my behaviour. I don't do drugs, and tried to commit suicide. It hurts me.
I know trying to kill myself is wrong. And yes, I suffered physical and emotional abuse as a kid. My mom tried to kill me b4 I became a man.
I put myself in the timeout room after sending rude Facebook message to Bestie about killing myself, and she treats me like a little baby.
Movie Title is the category. Here are RSTLNE's.
