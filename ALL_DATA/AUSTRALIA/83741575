Wonder at how many people you've looked at your whole life and never seen.

For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts is as restorative as sleeping, as nourishing as eating.
Love is all we have, the only way that each can help the other.
#RememberanceDay
Suppressing and ignoring your emotions only makes things worse, it's healthier to be more open and honest with what you are feeling.
If you are thinking like everyone else then you are not thinking at all.
There are instincts deeper than reason.
Words are ashes, you can collect ashes but out of ashes nothing grows.

In truth is strength, with that, you can withstand anything.
If it had not been for some storms you may never have obtained the knowledge you sit with today, they are blessings really.
Never interrupt your enemies while they're making a mistake.
Less is more.
Others have not walked your path, as long as you see yourself well considering the path you've walked, ignore others criticism. #strength
Can aliens hurry, drop from the sky or something already, think we need some excitement to shake things up a little, that would be great.
Do what sits well with you.
Watching the waves.
Keep lowkey and watch your life get better.
Know your own greatness.
Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem. First make sure you are not, in fact, surrounded by arseholes.
All humans sin, don't judge someone just because they sin differently than you.
Human beings say unrighteous things then get all righteous when others are unrighteous.
It's just a ride, and you can change it anytime you want to.
A journal is a place you take the trash out, it's exactly that, trash.
Every man's memory is his private literature.
In order to exercise creativity, freedom of thought is essential.
Words are like seeds, people throw them all the time. Its up to you to allow or disallow those seeds to grow within you.
Your inner peace is what matters most.
Those that talk down to you are just trying to walk tall by making you feel small, rise above.
Don‚Äôt attend every argument you‚Äôre invited to.
Stay Encouraged. (via @RealTalkKim) http://t.co/ZTS7KONtnD
May I live like the lotus at ease in muddy water.
With the rhythm of my body, the melody of my mind and the harmony of my soul, I create a symphony.
Look within and love will radiate out.
Simplicity, patience, compassion.
I love thunderstorms.
The soul has been given it's own ears to hear with.
You are who you think you are not what others think.
Be like a child, forever in play.
See the world with the eyes of a child and you will suddenly find that you are free.
Don‚Äôt let anyone walk through your mind with their dirty feet.
Rumours are started by haters, spread by fools, and believed by idiots.
It‚Äôs so easy to break down and destroy. The heroes are those who make peace and build. #MandelaDay
The moon is beautiful tonight.
Understand the root of conflict.
Don‚Äôt be pressured by the selfish self interest of others concerning your life, move at your own pace, only you know when you‚Äôre ready.
Stay quiet so the loud ones never know what to expect.
Honourable people don't go around gathering and distorting private material to maliciously character assassinate others, cowards do.
As long as there is measurement, which is the becoming, which is the process of thought, meditation or silence cannot be. JK
Remove yourself from outside noise for a while, others opinions, listen to yourself, be honest with yourself and transform.
Knowledge can make you or break you, choose wisely.
Be consciously aware of the present.
You are your own wise teacher, welcome deep silence, one body, peace, everything harmonious.
Self-mastery is the ultimate goal in life. By mastering ourselves all things become possible.
The way out is within.
The most wasted of all days is one without laughter. ~E.E. Cummings.
If justice is denied, let the law of karma take the ride. Nothing in this world is done without a price.
If you cannot find peace within yourself, you will never find it anywhere else. ~Marvin Gaye
The simplest of things are the most beautiful.
Every single thing that has ever happened in your life is preparing you for a moment that is yet to come.
