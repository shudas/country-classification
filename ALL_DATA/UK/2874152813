Feeling bitter and free like glitters raining on my eyes
Things I can't deal with: timezones and money

I always get super excited when I hear @mcbusted on the radio
I had a dream that @tommcfly had a flying umbrella like Mary Poppins... What could that mean?
Im sure i just saw @DougiePoynter in disguise on the Jools Holland show playing the trumpet for Ellie Goulding
We were watching the music video for crashed the wedding and we spotted young @mcflyharry playing the drums in the background!

Forever wanting to be in a relationship like @tommcfly &amp; @MrsGiFletcher ðŸ˜ª http://t.co/kMUIx1NuaB
A private number rang up and I was convinced it was just a caller from a different country so I hung up but it was the hospital lmao
The only thing I'm superbly excited for this Christmas is that there will be another doctor who episode on
Let's pretend me and my dog are best friends instead of her having a grudge over the fact I fell on her before
Gi retweeting has made my day ðŸ˜Š http://t.co/Ta8FSWETTT
