It's sad when your realize you weren't as important to someone as you thought you were
Fries before guys 
Is my motto
Again again the people in my life keep becoming the person they swore they'd never be
The more I see you the more I fucking hate you
You change for two reasons: either you learn enough that you want to or you've been hurt enough that you have to.
I'm deffinetly not the same person I was when this year started
I don't understand how someone can tell so many lies &amp; never feel bad about it.
Your really a lying asshole and I wish people saw that
Someone even if I don't know you text mee 12048908778

You'll end up really disappointed if you think people will do for you as you do for them. Not everyone has the same heart as you.
I never thought it was even possible to hurt this much
I'm tired of worrying
Sometimes we expect more from others because we‚Äôd be willing to do that much for them.
I feel so distant from the people that I'm closest to right now..
