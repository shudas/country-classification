Should've known not to buy a share bag of crisps. 🙈 every time!
One night out definitely requires 5 dresses to be ordered. Everyone likes options! 🎉🎉🎉
Is it acceptable to buy the same dress in three colours?! 🙈 can't find anything I like online! #girlproblems
Back at it. 🙈 #routine #work #gym #detox
Great night of chat 💗 Happy Birthday to my fave little boy Connor! @k_j_13 sneak peak of the gorgeous baby April and met Lewis too! #sotiny
I really wish id bumped into @therealgokwan at @AintreeRaces on #ladiesday pretty sure we'd be pals. #topguy 😃👍😘

You know you're drunk when you snapchat @CalvinHarris a seriously cringe video. #thereyago
Panic packing that extra few outfits. Every. Single. Time. 🙈 #packing #henparty
Thinks this is gonna make him famous. Some kid. 😂 @JamesReid83 the next Kim Kardashian! #sextape http://t.co/72iZrL1YuF

Planning the next fundraiser 😃 #turnanegativeintoapositive
Attempting some crafty DIY in the flat...this'll be entertaining! 🙈
3 drams and home before 11pm 😃💗🎉
Good intentions of going to the gym today. Painted my nails instead. Oopsie.
Dress needed for ladies day in a few weeks has turned into an obsession with a complete new Spring/Summer wardrobe! 🙈
Trying on the dress tonight post alterations...should probably have gone canny at lunch. 🙈 oops! #nervousbridesmaid
I swear time goes faster when we're asleep. 😴😴😴
The only thing that's gonna get me through today is the thought of a cuppa and the latest @Lookmagazine tonight after work. @michkeegan 😍😍😍😍
Praying the hen party fairies have cleaned the park...#nosuchluck
Post party cleaning is NAAAAT what I want to do today 😥 what a blast with my besties though! #WorthIt
Follow master @JamesReid83 rules and I won't get in trouble...what were the rules again?! 😂🙈 #badass
When you need to pee but you're still doing the 'my nails are wet' thing. #nightmare 💅
Can't wait for tomorrow! 🎉🎉🎉
Tonight's #Hollyoaks 😬 Wwwhhhaaattt???

It's sad how smug I am about having homemade soup for lunch. It's making me feel like I've really got my life together 😂 #ifonly
Productive Monday so far 😃💖
Baggiest shirt possible for dinner tonight! 🙊😋 #alldafood
It's that time of day when my living room looks like a disco! #sparkles #reflection http://t.co/5bEBO0zmK9
Need to unfollow all the Ibiza accounts if I'm not going this year. It's too emotional! 😂

Guilty of being the most impatient person ever when I want something. 🙊 #NOW
Suitably exhausted this morning! 😴 #whysosleepy
So, SO sleepy tonight. Mid week slump! 😴😴😴😴
A little visitor at work today #mesapup 🐶💜 http://t.co/Im9q9k20IB
More starving than normal tonight! 😋 feeeeeed me!
Looking at the @riverisland holiday shop long before I've booked a holiday. Priorities in order! 😂
If in doubt, add more glitter! 🎉
Fresh bedsheets. OH YES! 😃💜
Why are weekends so short?! 👎
Lovely catch up with the gals💕
Pj's on by 9pm 💕 #cosy #CalmBeforeTheStorm
I think I'm addicted to buying nail polish 🙈 already thinking about what colours I can buy tomorrow! 💅
Practicing with the nail art pen 😬 #hopeless #blobseverywhere
Constantly touching my face after my face mask 😂 #soft @lizearle
It's a lotions and potions Friday night 😃💕 #bliss
Funny it's #worldbookday I contemplated taking a book to read on my break. Contemplating is better than nothing for a girl who doesn't read!
Never been in the gym after 8.30 before! First time for everything! 👍
I have literally zero clue what's happening in #Revenge 🙈 too much to remember from week to week!
#ExOnTheBeach2 is such a guilty pleasure! 🙈
Huge blisters from walking in new trainers. 🙈 sore feet for the rest of the week! 👎
I need a trip away somewhere #chilltime
https://t.co/uNHxFuE6ew final thought of the day! 😂 #haters #silly
#TOWIE is gonna have to wait till tomorrow night. Can hardly keep my eyes open! 😴😴😴
So glad @ThursoCinema is open again, love a cinema trip! 👍🎥😀
I think I'd quite like to take up blogging. I don't know much about it, but I might put my ramblings on a website and call it a blog 👍
Now for the normal Sunday duties, preparation is key! #shoppinglist #mealplanning #gymplanning
50 shades was the perfect choice for Sunday viewing, giggling away like school kids 😂🙈👍
You know your pissed when you start googling flights to Vegas. 😂 #holiday
Love hearts? I meant to give you the hate hearts. Normal Sunday banter in Meadow Court. 😂
Need to stop being stressed over such little things. 🙈
Some QT with the girls is exactly what I need right now 💕 #weekend
Why change the habit of a lifetime? 👍😃🎉🎶🍹🍻 http://t.co/soI9y1DpJv http://t.co/6K80FoemiC
Shouting 'go away' to call time on an argument might be exceptionally rude but it's hugely effective! 😂 #TOWIEcatchup
What a sweetheart @samsmithworld is 💙 looking forward to drunkenly singing along with him at @Tinthepark 🎉👍😃💜
#kimkardashian must have heard me in Wick last week when I said I wanted to cut my hair and get a choker. That's totes why she's done it.
Peppermint tea, a pink lady, pj's and the #BRITAwards 💜 #cosy #relax
Dig out the rucksacks gals, we're off to @Tinthepark 😃😃😃😃🎶🍻🎉🍹 bring on Summer!
#hellostrathallan 😀👍🎊🍸🍻🎶🍹🎉 can't wait for @Tinthepark #summer
Exhausted after a busy but lovely Monday 😃 Mondays ain't so bad! 👍
#Revenge isn't the same when I can't binge watch episode after episode. I'm too forgetful for one episode a week! 🙈
Putting this out there, I think chokers are cool 👍👌 #shopping
Tried on the BM dress for Donna and Adam's wedding last night, even prettier than I remember!
Saw you at the pool this morning @debraweir2 @chuckieweir_34 but I was too far away/out of breath to shout! haha hope you're all well!
Light light light! :)
The little cull who keeps setting stuff on fire? He's my fave so far. 😂 #harrypotterandthephilosophersstone
For the next 6 weeks you'll find me at work, in the gym or planning hen parties. 😃😃😃 #preparationisthekey
Time to see what this Harry Potter crack is all about! 👍 #harrypotterandthephilosophersstone
Great chilled weekend with some of my fave people. Now for the dressing gown, couch and a movie 😃 #freshweekends

'wanna go look at material for curtains on Sat?'
@JamesReid83 'Why do you insist on ruining my weekends? I prefer when you work Saturdays' 😡
Lovely chilled weekend 💕😃
Has my hangover blurred my vision or did Peter Beal get hot? #EastEnders
Casually doing squats while catching up on #EastEnders every little helps! 😂💪
Looking forward to our group date tonight! 💗😃🎉🍸🍹🍷🍻🍔🍟
Painting my nails then doing housework was a recipe for disaster 😡👎
Dinner looks rank 👎 should never experiment on a Friday! Chipper may be the only option! #slowcookerfail
HMRC are going to feel the full Marion wrath tomorrow. Bunch of idiots. Quick to send a bill but make it virtually impossible to pay it! 😡👊
I forget hot much I love pineapple 😃💗👍🍍
Oh dazzle, what a plonker. 🙈 #hollyoakscatchup
Ate another egg today. It's stupid how happy I am that I've started to tolerate eggs 😂 don't quite like them yet but I'll get there! 👍😂🙈

One busy evening! How's it's bed time already?! 🙈
I need a shopping trip 😃👍👗👖👠👜💄👓
So, SO happy the bathroom is 99% finished.  Back to normality :) can't wait to dust off all my products that we're stuffed away for 2months!
I need to start a real bucket list. I say 'I'd love to do that' far too often. If it's on paper, it's gotta happen!
Just realised that over the weekend I bought 4 books. This is the most unlike me thing I've ever done! 😂🙈
Productive weekend full of tea, laughter, catch ups and DIY! 👍 #fave
3 years?😥😥😥 those were the best days! 🏡 #houseofskirtandtinytrousers @lisabrown587 @k_j_13 http://t.co/5chm78Ta5i http://t.co/s7P9PCUJgd

Trekking the Great Wall of china seems like a tremendous idea 😃 oh I do love a random internet browse 😂
David Tennant, consider yourself added to the sexy older man list. 😍 #hottie #NTA2015
It's about time #homeland got good again! 😃 I still say bring back Brodie, but this storyline will do I guess 🙈 #savesaul
