Done and dusted. Think I'll crank up some A Place to Bury Strangers to recover on the bus home :) #noiserockFTW
I am shocked at how many young teens are here tonight. He was at his prime when I was their age. More than a decade ago
Shooting Peter Andre tonight. Jokes and LOLs on a postcard to the usual address, please
Will miss my fellow students over in Ireland. Lovely bunch. Will also miss my trips to this pub...
Finished my course, passed all modules and the practical exam. On my way home now

Shooting @twinatlantic tonight. I suspect things are going to be pretty mental tonight.

The "Your Music" update for @Spotify - brill! The fact I can't use that feature offline - bad, wrong and evil.
