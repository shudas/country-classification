When you find parents' vacay pics you think you've lost on SD card. 😪💦Note to self: clean up/transfer photos from my 6 SD cards...
It's been awhile since I've packed, and it feels great. The excitement is beginning to come back to me. 🍃
Just saw my first fruit fly, flying in the house. It means spring is here?! But please stay outside.
Beginning to pack... Yeah now I'm stressed lol.
Eating perogies and seriously wondering what I'm gonna do in Japan since they don't do/sell perogies... This is serious. 😂 #perogyprobz
Finally feeling it.. And terrified! #CountdownBegins #PanicStartsNow http://t.co/sW55usZAG8
So now, it's beginning to hit me.. and I'm terrified!
After a month of searching, comparing, setting up appointments, attempting to reserve... I now finally have an apartment to move into. 😪
Because I have to choose a wallpaper NOW (for free) or suffer paying $500 later if I want it... #timedifferencessuck
Officially understand why Japan apartment hunting as a foreigner is a complete nightmare.

After being indecisive, finally chose an apartment. Now just to wait and see if I can move in earlier than the move in date... 😓💦
I feel like I have so much time, yet it'll be gone in a blink of an eye. That's the scary part.
So proud of her. 👏👭 https://t.co/JSEzdGd29s
So far, my experience with the MacBook has not been so great, lol. Feels so restricting ! 💦
Been a windows girl my whole life. Learning to find the Dos /Command center, etc. For Mac has been a nightmare. 😱💦💦

So many things I'd like to do as a single person first. Married, it's no longer just "my dreams, goals, etc" it's "our dreams, goals, etc"
They met 8 months ago, dated 7 months and will get married in 5m. Personally too fast for me. Or am I the only one who wants to marry late.
So glad I watched S3 just now. If I had to wait months to watch S4 I'd probs go mental and be checked in like Victoria, l o l. @Revenge
If we were able to talk I know you would have been happy that Jack and Emily now have a chance again. I know how opposed you were of Aiden.😅
In Japan I couldn't watch S3 @Revenge Catching up for S4 and just watched S3E22. I can't even. Emily's heart broke and so did mine.😱😫😖😢😭😭😡
