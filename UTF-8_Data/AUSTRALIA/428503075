Just swam with wild dolphins in the South Pacific Ocean, average Sunday
Being on the other side of the world to my family and friends is the hardest thing 🌏
Just booked my skydive over the Great Barrier Reef 🐠🐳🐟🐬
There are no words to describe how amazing Australia is and I've been here 48 hours 🐨
So in the 2 days I've been gone my dad has already fallen off the toilet drunk and split his head open
I have no words to describe what my mum means to me, I love her so much
So I've turned up to dance rehersals and Trevor the security guard from Bridge is just chillin in the studio 👀
Awful at taking panorama photos 👀
I'm gunna miss squad nights so much whilst I'm away 😢 http://t.co/qWRR0AXDbg
So looking forward to my Monday morning lay in😍😍😍
Trying to remember where I've put things is such a struggle
My last full weekend in Ox 🙊😢
Just had to pay for my inhalers, do they think I choose to be wheezy
Love being tucked up in bed early 🐻
Didn't get id'd for 50 shades of grey, there's a first for everything 👶
Drakes 'Take Care' album will always be my fav/his best 🎶
Public transport when you own your own car is not fun 👀
Up and out 💪 I love busy days
Whenever I see an ambulance with blue flashing lights I always feel extremely grateful that I'm safe and well 🚑

It must be unhealthy the amount of time I spend with the same 10 people
212 will always be the tune💃
More than likely that I'm awake at this time every night 😴

Food is just constantly on my mind
Not bein able to find the Friday night Camera photos has done me and @Christiian_ML some favours 😶😂
Long drive back to Ox on my own🚶
There's something about being home alone at night that makes me assume I'm gunna get burgled and kidnapped 😩😶
One Direction are definitely my guilty pleasure 👀
I must spend 90% of my money on food
Wonder who and what will be the most important in my life in a few years time compared to now 🙇 hmmm
I am the most indecisive person on the planet
November and December are two of my favourite months🙊⛄️🎅💫❄️

I've broken my finger. Lol
I've got that Friday feeling... http://t.co/bCvT8y7Pek
I would love to know what goes through some people's minds
I hate being awake at this time
I've come home to an empty fridge, what happened to 'sharing is caring'
Can't wait to have a place of my own so that everything in the fridge doesn't get eaten by every other fucker but me
I could eat the whole of tescos right now I'm that hungry
I can't remember the last time I worked on a Saturday🙆💁
I love The Apprentice🙋
