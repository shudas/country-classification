My favourite anecdote is that The Great Gatsby was originally called Trimalchio in West Egg. Good one, F. Scott. #nailedit
I got one of those robotic vacuums, but I cannot figure out how the f**king thing works. Honestly, actual vacuuming was easier
Not, you know, that this has happened. And definitely didn't happen last night.
PSA: Never, ever watch Celeste and Jesse Forever after a breakup. You'll make embarrassing late-night phone rants and eat the entire fridge

Sweat my ass off in pitch blackness while a coked-out spandex Barbie screams at me over electo music? Oh, you mean spin class. Sure.
Now this is advertising I can get behind. #sexpositive #whosayscalgaryisconservative http://t.co/x7HdHpK2BN
I vacuumed up so many zebra hairs last night that I clogged the vacuum. Who's life is this?! #butactually #wtf
Goofiest pet pic #1 and #2. Do I have the silliest furry family or what? http://t.co/UdYlzpVUHc
Ermagerd!! Might actually get some writing done for the first time since the puppy! I tired her out mwahahaha
Ps I'm back from my hiatus, Twitter. Come at me!
Is it weird that two of my animals are named after @SEPauthor MCs? They're just such great feisty ladies, just like my four-legged fam
And her brother Charlie had to come home with us too, of course :) http://t.co/Cp5DN00RUc
Meet Phoebe, the newest member of my family!! http://t.co/8RqoWEDjC0
You'd think I'd have learned from my boobs that I can't make things grow with my mind. #booblessons
I got a terrarium for my desk at work. I planted everything last night, and now I keep checking it every five minutes. No plants yet :(
On the bright side, though, my alter ego's website got a big-ass makeover, so check that out if you want: http://t.co/JkmENFt8JW

This week has been the most ballsack ever. I miss my kitty. Nobody gives cuddles like he did. wahhhhhhhhhh.
Tonight I have to say goodbye to my Jack-Jack. I'll miss a ton, little man. You are loved like crazy. http://t.co/KBH1F4Nei3
This feels like the never ending week :( Stupid cold, go away.
How do the women at work carry tampons to the b/room? It's weird if I carry my purse.I never have pockets.Does everyone but me know a trick?
On an unrelated note, I might be losing it. But I'm in the madly-in-love stage with my WIP, so it's to be expected
#janowrimo, I'm coming for you. Watch your back, 'cause I have ALL the words
That time Tina Fey and Amy Poehler made not one, but two, Bill Cosby jokes. #GoldenGlobes
Today I'm sending loving kindness out into the world. 'Cause we could all use some. Or maybe I could use some today... #meditation
Naps! #catsofinsta http://t.co/oT8cWVTtfx
Got my inbox at work below 50 emails for the first time in weeks. Ohhhhh yeahhhhh
I have pre-haircut stress. Logical Lisa knows that haircuts are not that big a deal, but the other Lisa trips BALLS every. Single. Time.
My boo is away, so his #buildabear alter ego, Fuzz Lightyear, is sleeping with me instead :) http://t.co/yw5apfSb3a
Struggling super hard with the subplot in my WIP. I know they belong together, but how the hell are they gonna get there? #amwriting
Back to work for this gal. Sadly, that means less #amwriting. Le sigh

Wow. I got super distracted by the awesome #StopAbleism2015. Check it out!
#StopAbleism2015 Because I'm so, so much more than my disability, just like you're so much more than your ignorance #compassion
#StopAbleism2015 Because "you seem normal" isn't the compliment you think it is. Invisible disabilities deserve respect too.
#StopAbleism2015 B/c an HR rep at a big 5 bank told me to "get thicker skin" when quitting b/c my mental disorder made work there miserable
#StopAbleism2015 Because those of us who are invisibly disabled shouldn't be treated as though our disabilities don't exist.
Guys, it's happening! Day 1 of #JaNoWriMo and I'm actually #amwriting
It's #JaNoWriMo starting tomorrow and I'm pretty excited! http://t.co/VEtazRPLhG

Bf is out of town, and I was too lazy to fold all our clean laundry before bed, so I just slept with it on the bed. Pull it together, self.

As she did, the wind blew her skirt up and she remembered what she’d forgotten in Dan’s office - one pair of lacy black panties. #1lineWed
So, I posted something very personal on the blog today, which I don't normally do. I felt like I just had to. http://t.co/Qa6I7dzUj8

Dragging my ass at work today. When did I become a woman who gets so tired after a day of shopping? I'm genuinely exhausted and sore.
Scraping off my car before work this morning made me want to stay home with some tea and Christmas treats and do some #amwriting
Re-watched #saved. Such a good movie! Makes me kinda want to write #ya
Sooo much Christmas shopping and gift-making was done this day! #pooped #HappyHolidays #DIY
My cat threw up 7 times yesterday. I'm pretty sure I've been cleaning fishy puke out of the carpet for about a decade. (He went to the vet)
