Oh, one last thing. Have an honest ego, because the cracks start to show in a dishonest one and could potentially get broken down…
The dancers let me dance with them on the podiums and on the banisters in the V.I.P section. I'd never felt so sexy in all my life 👅
Not even gassed but last night I realised… I actually slay
I looked fucking GOOD last night. Rich men constantly in my face! Just sweet them up, get in the V.I.P, get my drinks and keep it moving 💅

Omds I was listening to 2 radio sets at the same time without realising and was wondering why everyone was talking over each other 😂
About ur talking about letting off shots when ur not even about it. Like say death isn't very real shut up man
Almost 10 years on and I'm still very angry about my brothers death but if God wanted his angel home early he wanted his angel home early
Ppl confidently chat about nuff shit they have not been thru, been near, done or even seen. Not realising they're hitting home for some ppl
