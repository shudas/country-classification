I used to be annoyed at @Sportsnet for blacking out so many games but now I understand they were doing it for my own good. Awful announcing.

Wheeler scoring proves once again that the tooth fairy leaves goals under hockey player's pillows.
They should have a telethon for innocent kids of Leafs fans.
I'm beginning to think the Twitter is full of what my mom calls "smart Alecs". You know who you are.
Anyone else notice those ads in glass behind nets on TV? Is that a new thing?

Congrats to Wyatt Tait, son of Kathi and @WFPEdTait, member of AAAA B-ball champ Oak Park Raiders. You'll hear from him again, I'm betting.
Well, I always said Evander Kane was going to get the Winnipeg Jets into the playoffs.
Hey, if you were the Oilers goal horn guy you'd be a little twitchy, too.
Stempniak from Tlusty and Myers. After Stafford opens scoring. And Pavelec riding .970 save % entering game. This is so Jets.
Now Lee Stempniak. Of course.
I'm getting some pushback on my Evander Kane-as-a-babysitter suggestion. Obviously you ppl haven't seen The Hangover.
I think it's nice that despite a long, horrible season the gritty Leafs still have the perseverance to break records.
I think Evander Kane would be an awesome babysitter. #qandEh
Stafford scores again. If Kevin Cheveldayoff isn't buying lottery tickets then he's doing it wrong.
Have the Oilers scored on Pavelec yet?
SHUT UP YOU GUYS BIG BROTHER IS STARTING.
The best hour of a college basketball game is the last minute. #MarchMadness
2. Now a guy who's historically had concentration lapses now seems to have laser focus. How long it lasts is the critical question.
1. I don't think Pavelec found religion. Think he's a guy who saw career mortality with loss of No. 1 job to rookie then floater in St. Loo.
Time for bed. Safe travels home, @DoubleEmMartin.
I remember Team Russia from the last Bond movie.
I think @DoubleEmMartin missed her deadline.
Give the lady her props.
Holy crap. Jones might steal a deuce here for the win.
I'm not sure what's worse: Watching a curling game at 3:30 am or still thinking Jennifer Jones might win. I'll check into a clinic tomorrow.

Not even Scott Oake can perk this up.
I think this is a great cause, but I need something to perk me up, not make me sad and sleepy.
I just washed my face, but did not brush my teeth because, snacking.
Well, a 2 goal lead would be nice.
I think the 'T' in Tlusty should be silent. #Lusty

Don't get me wrong, Canuck place is AWESOME, just why don't we ever get any of the slobber
We are Rogers, we care. You stupid corporate fuckwads.
Wouldn't it be awesome if Winnipeg got this kind of shameless, ass kissing coverage
I can see the Strombo Limp Bizkit mashup "he did it all for the cookie"
You can't write skits that good
What was that?!?!
Andrew Ladd is so spectacularly unspectacular and steady as hell with a penchant for silly penalties
That was like Steve-O running into Tyson's fist
We are back to playing simple road games. I like it
See, that's what leaders do. Hot at skates by Stafford and hits him, Staff skates the other way #TheLittleThings
This intermission brought to you by RAW Sewage, sponsoring shit for years #Rogers
It hurts so much when your fave team plays your second fave team. In all honesty, I'd like a pre shootout post regulation win
That post made a spectacular save
#NHLJets, remember a couple years ago we dreaded games against Anaheim, St Louis etc....we are now dreaded the same way. Big. Fast. Skilled
