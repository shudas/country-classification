"These nuts"
Sometimes I like to lay here and read all of my tweets haha.
I just need a hug
I am literally so depressed I just want to lay in my bed and cry. Why? I wish I knew.
Literally no food in my house. Not cool.
Okay now I have to get up.
I want to get out of bed but at the same time it's cold so maybe fuck that shit. 😴
Yes, I do have arguments with Siri.
So why embrace it, cause your a FUCKING joke. 😂
Going to get me nails did. 💅🏼
I'm still hungry
My phones dying but too lazy to get the charger, when it dies I'll be upset then I'll eventually grab the charger. Fuck.
It's been a long day without you my friend, but I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. 👼🏼 http://t.co/0sUZ8lG9yd
