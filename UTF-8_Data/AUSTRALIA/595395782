Am I the only person not excited about new Star Wars? ROTJ ended the series pretty well I thought.
Asylum seeker legislation is getting worse. At which point does the government stop and think "hmm, nah that's pretty bad"? #auspol
Misread hashtag of the day: #brandzacday.

Brand Zac Day? http://t.co/wDD9vjVfEc
Off to uni for class. I really do love learning! #happy
The first ep of Veep season 4 was a little flat and awkward. Hopefully ep 2 will get back into the swing of things.
This government has become a parody of itself. Defence Minister can't name the leader of ISIL because of "operational matters". #auspol
.@ekathimerini reporting that Greek Fin Min to meet Obama on Thursday. First member of new Gov to meet US pres.

I wish I could get a tax deduction for dating. Baes be expensive.
"Still early days". Can we find something new to say on election day? #nswvotes
I like seeing pollies like Gladys and Carmel on @ABCNews24. Good, serious discussion with out partisan backhanders. #nswvotes
Land drones? RT@ASE: #Russia is developing a tank that swims and chooses its own targets http://t.co/l4R7tsZ7Gn http://t.co/dGoJHBWIBx
Why is it that most media outlets come out on the side of science in the vaccine debate but the opposite on climate change?
So @NSWPowerSellOff sent me a letter "thanking" me for signing their petition. Except I never signed the petition. Doesn't look kosher.

Alright! @LindaBelcherFOX followed me! (She's my spirit animal)
With @VickGwyn at the @KnightsbridgePh. Sophie at the bar is the fucking best ever. We are a little in love. #bar #cocktail #bartender
The day I travel 150km away from the coast is the day I have a massive craving for fish and chips.
Found a great little bookshop in Canberra, Electric Shadows. Small range but a great selection.

#TCNathan off the coast but won't cross. He is that awkward kid lingering around, hesitant to ask the girl for a dance.
Hand-rails are for holding not leaning. If the trains jerks to a stop and I lose my balance and bowl you over its your fault not mine.
I think Abbott truly believes he is helping Indigenous Australia, but his solution is a continuation of colonisation. #auspol
Ireland managed to accidentally legalise a bunch of drugs and possibly accidentally ban straight marriage. Come on, Ireland get it together!
Being Prime Minister is a #lifestylechoice @TonyAbbottMHR, can we stop paying your salary? #auspol

I'm a little jealous of how much fun @sarahinthesen8 looks like she's having at #MardiGras!
Have a great #MardiGras everyone! Keep it real, keep it queer!
Joe hockey will soon be telling us the only way to keep taxes at the same rate will be by increasing them.
Isn't change the opposite to status quo? MT@ABCNews24: Hockey: The status quo can only remain the status quo if we all undertake change
Straight people dressing up as Freddie Mercury for a "gay" themed party. I'm not sure I like that. What does twitter think?
There is a terrible misogynistic undercurrent in Golden Dawn. And Kasidiaris is an example of this.
When Kasidiaris attacked Kanelli, he wasn't only attacking a fellow MP. He was attacking democracy and attacking a woman who spoke up.
My feels about the #SBSEurovision announcement are pretty much summed up by @latikambourke's tweets over the last 20 minutes
These guys should be representing Australia at #eurovision - Norman Gunston &amp; Effie.: http://t.co/rdaDQC21R6
Well that was anticlimactic. #eurovision
Australia is sending Guy Sebastian to #eurovision
Seriously, I have a meeting in like 15 minutes. I neeeeeed this soooooon @SBSEurovision #eurovision
Who is it for Australia in eurovision? Announcement soon! #eurovision
Come on @SBSEurovision let us know who it is! Highlights? I need to get back to work.
I think the Aus constitution is archaic in not allowing dual-national MPs. Citizenship and nationhood is becoming more complex. #auspol
First day back at uni! Good to be back in a learning environment again.
The Christians evangelising to commuters in Belmore Park next to the homeless have their priorities wrong.
Someone farted on this packed train and it is burning my nostrils.

Please don't assume an ethnicity based on my surname. Also, don't stereotype that ethnicity. It's ignorant and you're stupid.

The announcements say the 1.36pm has been cancelled but there is nothing on the website or on @TrainLinkNorth. Any confirmation?
Why cancel a train but only announce delays for the other direction? @TrainLinkNorth
I love when @TrainLinkNorth cancel my train without any information. That's heaps cool. Like so cool.
Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Stay safe my QLD brethren. #TCMarcia
All these articles about the dollar "bottoming" confuses and intrigues me...
Gov thinking about scrapping the census to save money. Very short sighted. Census helps target gov service delivery. #auspol
Also, my phone wants to autocorrect partyroom to partyboob.
Turnbull as Lib PM may be publicly popular but will probably cause a clusterfuck in the Lib partyroom. #auspol
They are 30 min late for my appointment... The one I arrived at 5 min early for
At this practice they will bar people who are late to their appointments. #irony
Pet peeve: when doctors appointments are meaningless and you may as well have walked in as a walk-in patient.
Ever since I was a kid watching @Eurovision with my mum I dreamt of one day seeing Australia compete! I can't wait! Thanks @EBU_Eurovision!
What's with the goodlooking people running shirtless at Cent. Park? I came out to have a good time and I'm feeling so attacked right now.
The problem with being a Lib PM is that you have to be moderate for the voters but rightwing for the party. #libspill
If the ALP wants to capitalise on #libspill, now is a good time to get the volunteers out en masse and talk policy with voters. Esp. in NSW.

What is Jensen doing? All I see are tweets saying "Jensen". Nothing else. Someone tell meeeeeee! #auspol
I remember a time when PMs used to fight leadership challenges and implement long term reform at the same time. #Gillard #nostalgic #auspol
Why is the LNP so scared of Hanson? They basically have the same policies nowadays. #qldpol #qldvotes
When Abbott invokes "the chaos of the Labor years", he's basically saying he will pull a Rudd and fuck things up. #auspol
I dunno, Tony sounded a bit whingey today: it's the media's fault, it's Labor's fault...
What about the climate change burden? #npc #auspol
Shorter Abbott: "it's all Labor's fault" #npc #auspol
So the problem is that people in your party aren't saying the right thing to journos... #npc #auspol
I'm hearing lots of words but he's not really saying anything at all. #npc #auspol
Need help remembering how to spell Palaszczuk? @GrahamPerrettMP had the best tip: "PALA Sydney Zoo Canberra Zoo United Kingdom".
Would be nice to get a Minister for Equality, @AnnastaciaMP, something to think about? #qldpol #qldvotes2015
24hr media cycle, social media mean voters are hungry for info. Controlled messages now lose elections. Local-based messages win elections.
When pollies say "we didn't communicate enough", all we hear is "we didn't spin hard enough". Just accept you lost. #qldpol
Wow. QLD exit polls... This one is going to be one to watch tonight! #qldpol #auspol #qldvotes
Blaming Peta Credlin is a cop-out. The Prime Minister is his own person, and if he isn't, maybe the problem lies with the PM. #auspol
Good to hear that @yanisvaroufakis is the new Greek finance minister!
Apparently I should be tweeting more.
The phrase "printed...using parliamentary entitlements" really pisses me off. #auspol #nswpol pollies please take note
You know Australia is fucked when Australians are more offended by live animal export than innocent humans in punitive detention.
