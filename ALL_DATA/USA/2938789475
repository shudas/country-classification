Omg they need to hurry.
So I text my boss like an idiot telling him I'm going to a dance performance for my cousin.
But no. It goes to the last person you were texting.
This phone is so stupid. You would think that when it notifies you for a text, and you click it, it would go to that message.

Never ever ever forget that.
I love you as much as there are stars in the universe.
I don't care if you don't love me back. Because all that matters to me, is you.
You're always going to be loved by me. No matter what happens, I'll always love you.
Peach is a hoe.

I feel like my head just got ran over by a semi.

I'm supposed to be getting like a $900 refund. That should help.
I think I'm going to plan my own trip to Japan. I'll go by myself if I have to.
I thought it was funny.
Because I get called a bitch a lot.
Okey told me he got called a bitch and I told him, it doesn't feel good, does it?
Someone called me Dom today and someone asked for you yesterday @pitfallseeds. They miss you over here.
Thinking about doing something stupid. I have a ridiculous amount of money coming in. I'd probably piss a lot of people off.
This is seriously scary. #hikari http://t.co/TDMR15REgy
Anger is a dangerous emotion.
Egbqfhqgbqtjqtbwgjwgnagbagnafbwgbafbwtktjqgbafjwgnwykwyk.....  &gt;:(
And they can't drive me to where I need need to go because they can only drive 15 miles.
Ugh, this is so freaking stupid.
And Nissan won't give me a loaner car because I'm not 21 yet. And my mom isn't responding.
I come out of my way, ON MY DAY OFF, and they call me from work.
This is so stupid.
I feel sick...
Fucking Wendy.
Like, right as soon as she leaves, someone is either hurt, dying, or dead.
Wendy is so freaking inconvenient.
My friend is in Japan and I'm crying because its beautiful and I want to be there.
Why, Wendy? Why?!?!?
Fuck you guys.
Fuck that. I'm out.
No no no no no no no no no
I'm so tired...
I care about you, a lot more than you probably care about me.
Fuck spiders. I normally think they're cool. But this one was just too creepy.
Lmao watching fast and the furious and it has ads from american pie and bring it on again
My friend is going to Japan for a week. Kind of jealous.
Did my hair today. I feel cute.
A dragon once told me, "when the universe pushes you, you push back."
Renan is a closet whovian!
I've been thinking about my life a lot. I'm scared I'm not strong enough to make it in the end. And that's what I hate the most. My weakness
Had like four people ask me if I wanted to see Fast &amp; Furious.

#collegelife
I'm doing my homework and someone please kill me.
Ugh. Kill me now.
This anime is really weird...
Wtf??????????????????????????????
I have made a terrible mistake.
Why am I so sad?
Eggs are great aren't they. They're just so yellow.
Goodbye, Club Nintendo:(
Had to work with Ren last night so that was fun.
I need to take a shower... But I'm hungry.
Well, today was fun.
God dammit, that cliff hanger. What does he do?
I have to go to court today.
I hope that make a Mewtwo amiibo
So pretty :) http://t.co/GJT1Io0Xg6
I think I took the wrong pill.
Why can't you be real?
I've fallen in love with another fictional character.
Yes might be getting my Majora's Mask 3DS today.
This show is weird.

I got a new car today
How is it that the new version of my car is cheaper????
Bit I'll be getting a new car soon.
I have a headache
Like, ugh.
My meds make me super obnoxious.
The Homura in me is coming out.
I wish I could go back in time... I'd do it over and over until I got it right.
I've woken up at 7 for the past 5 days. What's wrong with me?
I should get up and take a shower.
Wow this game makes my eyes hurt
Ugh all these damn kids.
Watching Revolutionary Girl Utena with Renan :) &lt;3
We got Mega Man and MP10 Yoshi ^_^
Finally home.
I wish there wasn't anyone in the store I would have told him to go fuck himself
And then he asked me for my number.
And he was like oh what's it made out of cause I can never get my semen off of the ceramic ones
And I told them we had it available for pre-order and that we had the collectors edition too.
Lmao these people did a battletoads prank call yesterday.
Happy Birthday Ren
Did my nails... http://t.co/gdObtAEp2T
My sister scratched my stupid face. http://t.co/mcmG2JGAt0
Its pretty decent.
I did find out my credit score yesterday...
I feel like shit today
Just got done cleaning at work. Now I gotta clean at home.
I feel old. So much medication.
I should take my pills. :/
But, I'm scared.
As a manager!!
I'm finally going back to work.
I would very much like to throw a pie at your face.
I did not sign up for this!
Like wtf do you expect me to do?
They're like, I paid $60 for that.
When people get made because their FIFA 2007 gets like .02 cents.
I hope you fell the passive aggressiveness in my comment.
And Renan got his employee ID
It was slow for a Friday.
Today was a good day at work.
Oh, people are funny
Oh crap. Its Friday the 13th.
Lmao someone told me to burn in hell
Or fucking books and school supplies.
I'm pretty sure homeless kids could use clothes and food more than a video game.
Video games are a luxury, NOT a necessity.
Grow the fuck up...
You think thats going to make GameStop look like a saint?
Because what's the point of donating shit that won't work???
And I posted something and all these people are mad at me because I called them stupid...
But they're all clearly scratched and whatnot.
And he was all, man you guys could be donating these.
And found a bunch of games for field destroy.
Like some guy posted a video digging through gamestops trash.
People on Facebook are stupid.
My therapist is putting me on anti-depressants.
No one can co-sign with me because everyone else has loans out.
I won't be able to get another car...
Why is the universe constantly shitting on me?
Fun fact about me: I really like puzzles. Like 1000+ pieces and those 3D ones too. They're cool.
Like, it knows what your hungry for.
You know what the fridge is? Its a fucking psychic type. Wtf
The fan is an air type. The microwave is a fire type. The washer is an ice type and the lawn mower is a grass type
And fucking Rotom? Its a fucking microwave. A lawn mower. A fridge. A washer. And a fan.
How the fuck is there a trash Pokemon.
