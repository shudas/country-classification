Heading over to the @KeweenawYP meetup tonight at Gino's in Hancock! Who's with me?! #keweenaw #networking
Now - let's get to it! Love me some playoff hockey. Only thing on TV that's worth the price of cable / satellite bill.
Sure, any team could beat them in a series, but it'd be a huge upset. There are six elite teams, four in one bracket.
I keep reading how much parody NHL playoffs have. Disagree. No one in East close to NYR, and Anaheim well ahead of three others in bracket.
Also, love this quote by Backes, "The great thing about hockey is you can smile and shake hands and, when it‚Äôs all over, have a beverage..‚Äù
Love this story on David Backes by @RussoStrib. St. Louis' experience gives them edge IMO.  http://t.co/YVOFLkp5DX
I'm shocked at how many apps are ready to go with an Apple Watch extension already. I can't imagine any will actually be useful.
Playoff predictions - Two things too obvious to balk at, ANA to WCF and NYR runs East (sneaks past Mon). Then, St. Louis wins the Cup.

Had fun writing about student rep Jared. Good kid. Skated with him the last two years in Cal. http://t.co/sdpqfLnxYd http://t.co/AXj7WNIDGC
I hope Apple brings iMessages to http://t.co/hn1yqvStT9.
Love the new messages notification on iOS. No more accidentally quick replying to a group!
Sad to see that Houghton, Calumet and Marquette all missed out on the Hockeyville contest. ... and they picked the soo? What?
I've had @cities97radio on for less than three hours. Already on the third play of Uptown Funk. The machine that is radio.
Registered for the @hewebMI conference. It's going to be AWESOME.
Microsoft Office 2015 looks 10x better than 2011. You've gotta love the things Microsoft has been doing lately.
We're less than three innings into the @Twins season, and the heartbreak is already setting in. #Winnersville
On that last tweet, he didn't care at all about the @CalWolverines, he simply really likes the animal. Loves the artistry of our logo.
I just took a call from guy from L.A. obsessed with all things wolverines. He's smitten by the @CalWolverines logo made by @JonEslinger.
I love Google Calendar on iOS. Their design work continues to head in a great direction.

Every year I forget how much I LOVE girl scout cookies. #yum
Guys - FOUR HOURS UNTIL #GIBSONCUP. Cannot wait.
LRT: Where are the Big 10 teams? ;)
Just saw someone call the U.P. "MUP," as in Michigan's U.P. WHAT? #mup #upperpeninsula
What if people took life as seriously as they take typos?

The @FULionsFootball coaches are probably best in D-III at wearing crew neck sweatshirts. #FinnUPride
After an update, our webmail now defaults pressing "enter" to immediately send the e-mail you're writing. That's worked out well...
Just completed a 1.61 mi run - Quick run with @TheLunaMae under March sunshine! http://t.co/ahhIyQ4yud #RunKeeper
.. so rumor has it a TV crew from  California will be here next week for the Gibson Cup. #whoa #glhl #keweenaw
My co-worker has our emotional state this afternoon nailed down: https://t.co/zgUq7DmyRe "A little guilty, a little sad."
I'm not proud to say that I'm going to be trying the bacon-crust pizza. I'm less proud to say I'm excited about it. CANNOT WAIT. #bacon

Things I loathe: Retweet to vote for Thing A, Favorite to vote for Thing B. How about no.
Final home game of the year. #glhl (@ Calumet Colosseum in Calumet, MI) https://t.co/hOcpPRYWiW
Tie game with 0:55 left. Who's gonna be the hero? Comon' LIONS!
GSAC semifinal between Finlandia and Agnes Scott getting tight, @FinlandiaLions up by 4 with less than two minutes left. #FinnUPride

Looks like the @mnwild picked up yet another Finn today. Outdoor game jerseys might have to read "SUOMI."
VEILLIEUX!!!!!
LRT: hoping to pick up some biking in 2015. My commute would be ~8 miles and very flat. Sounds ideal.. but I'm not crazy enough for winter..
I always get a kick out of the TV6 commenters when a new chain store moves to the region. People are so hungry for big chain stores. WHY?
Microsoft determines you're an adult if you can charge $0.50 to a Visa card. #nowyouknow
"Top Tracks in Your Social Network" is my new favorite @Spotify feature. Neat. Turns out my friends love Beck, Mourn and J. Cole. #WhoKnew
Chromecast is now up and running at home. Picked up my free $6 google play credit just in time! Any advice for making it amazing?
My best photoshop work in years. See you in Calumet tonight! #glhl http://t.co/dW91vQa1Ls

Opening and closing lines are fantastic. The closing, "After all, it's important to know what to expect when you're expecting."
Spark Plug Awards for Chamber went really well tonight. Thanks to all who put it together! Congrats to winners!... https://t.co/3U5nTN5qDV
Bryan Adams - (Everything I do) I Do It For You #FinnLOVEdia
That reminds me of a hashtag I can't wait to find a use for at @FinlandiaU: #FINNLOVEDIA
I just turned on @iHeartRadio's "Love Songs Radio" in the lobby. #InYourEyes #WonderfulTonight #OnlyLoveCanConquerAll

I had the opportunity to speak with Bob Jacquart, owner of @StormyKromer today. Feeling inspired. Check @FinlandiaLive for highlights.
All the naughty business on @UPTravel's Facebook appears to be cleaned up. Is the page back in good hands?

While I'm at it‚Ä¶ Apple, can you make me a computer between the Mac Mini and Mac Pro that's not an all-in-one or laptop? #thanksguys
Hey Apple - I know you're listening - can you make a way to dismiss notifications on OS X? Thanks guys!
I was wondering how long it'd take a media source to finally cover the @UPTravel Facebook hack story  ... http://t.co/8KgY0q1K1V
Good luck @UPTravel, my best advice is to call @Facebook's advertising department. More responsive when they can make money off the fix.
What an embarrassment for @UPTravel. The fact they haven't been able to regain access is a great example of @Facebook customer service.
So Chevy is definitely stealing my heart so far in this game. That Colorado. #want
We didn't pull the trigger on a SB ad, but we're ecstatic about our latest @FinlandiaU campaign! @DefinedVisuals https://t.co/ox2ozhmNVD

60 day free trial of @Spotify Premium starts NOW. Any advice?
Not at Htn-Hnck GBB? Well, you just missed a great left-footed kick save by @redveale, who clearly missed his calling as a tender. #ccpreps
Reading about Windows 10 once again has me thinking MSFT is heading in the right direction. Surface, Yoga Pro, big all-in-ones are awesome.
Proud to hear @FinlandiaLions hockey earned a BIG win tonight! Well done guys, keep that going tomorrow! #cawlidgehawkey #finnupride
