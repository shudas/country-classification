The story is right there and my God, it's exhilarating! I just want to do this every day for forever. #amwriting #feelsogood
And it's there. The flow of time, the moment, the dialogue, a vivid setting, the push and pull of struggle...the story.
But today, I took an outline I drafted many months ago, renewed it with fresh ideas, gave characters flesh and blood and feeling and I wrote
And no amount of prodding will bring it alive.
That this time, any creativity I ever had will have left me cold. That the characters will stand still without warmth or feeling.
Every time I sit down to the blank page, anxiety rears its head. I'm certain the story won't be there.
