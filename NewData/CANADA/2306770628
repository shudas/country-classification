At the beginning nobody ever looks towards the end. Now being at the end, All U do is look back at all we've been through from the beginning
On a positive note , this time of year I get to watch the sun come up every morning while I'm stuck in traffic
Take an online speak-out course in the morning , behind a AAA bench in the afternoon! Hockey is an interesting sport to be part of !
Happy 16th birthday to jake Steele. Best point in lacrosse I ever had
Sometimes when you stick your neck out to try and make a situation better. You need to be careful not to get your head lopped off from it
