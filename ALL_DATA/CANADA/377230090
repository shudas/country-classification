This works without having the 3rd of the chord present, also.
This enables chords that would otherwise be impossible to play with one hand you're welcome
This works best in the lower registers. So for example G2-C3-Eb3 implies C2
Piano Tip: Use 2nd inversion chords to imply a missing fundamental try it
How about "My brain, my choice"? #SickNotWeak
And all of this progress in 7 months. That is amazing. If you're anti-psych meds, you can shut up now.
Dissociation &amp; brain fog are clearing nicely. Depression &amp; anxiety are very manageable but I would like to wean off/down meds if possible
"AREN'T YOU WORRIED THE MEDS ARE CHANGING WHO YOU ARE" bruh SSRI's and anxiolytics quite literally saved my life. So stop.
Avid why so much are you making me want a MICROSOFT product ugh

Greg said his favourite chord voicing is root-fifth-octave-third I said hell yeah and then we slammed some beers
I don't care what the top note of the chord is as long as it's NEVER the 5th
Good thing I didn't break my wrist because I'm a musician right
MD, don't run with your bass on your back because it's heavy and you'll fall on your face in front of a 126 full of people
My brain chemicals are improperly balanced &amp; I have a traumatic past but I'm a stellar musician so I've got that going for me which is nice
You know what guys I REFUSE to learn anything on the piano that isn't Stravinsky or hip-hop

Nothing Was The Same: The day I travelled all the way to stupid Etobicoke to pick up my P-Bass
Nothing Was The Same: The day I got my mecca-white guy undercut
Nothing Was The Same: The day I learned how to make a classic martini
Nothing Was The Same: The day I bought an iPhone
Nothing Was The Same: The day I discovered melatonin
I just talked a friend down from a panic attack as others have done for me. I hope he pays it forward also.

Having my piano tuned to A=415.3Hz is forcing me to play in all of the Weird Keys
Or the set time or cover? https://t.co/ia18g4UFaw
Ok I don't recall 'Marvin's Room' having SO much reverb on EVERYTHING did I miss something @Drake?

I would like very much to turn my past suffering into art
I'm not putting you down. I'm propping myself up. I've seen corners of the mind that would have you crying for your mama (I was)
You wouldn't last 5 minutes in my head.
Why so much is no one discussing misogyny in today's pop music
I'm a big shaky ball of anxiety and hyperactive nervous system but this too shall pass
