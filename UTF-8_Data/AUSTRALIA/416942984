Great to see Ah Chee will line up with the @PAFC for the first time this weekend. Testament to the old saying "Hard work pays off."
Cutts and Golby unlucky.
Stoked that @stakes14 is back. Long time between drinks for the big man. Good luck big fella. #GOLIONS
Big changes in the Lions team, but it makes the msg clear. Great to see @HarrisAndrews41 will be doning the jumper satdy night. #GOLIONS
This made me laugh. http://t.co/q067S82OF4
"If the road is easy, you're likely going the wrong way." 
We are behind you 100% @JLeppitsch . #GOLIONS #Prideinthejumper
How's the hammy Mezz? @Merrett21
At this rate we will have to ask the @AFL for top-up players. Injuries suck, and the @brisbanelions seem to get cruelled by them every year.
Might avoid watching any footy shows this week. Me thinks they won't be very nice to my beloved @brisbanelions ðŸ˜ž
Still loving watching @jadenmcgrath. The kid has some guts. A lot of heart in him. #GOLIONS #Prideinthejumper
Hope the knee is ok @MichaelClose33. fingers crossed. #GoLions
We move on. Tomorrow is a new day. Bring on the Tigers!!! #GoLions #Prideinthejumper #GettotheGabba
And once again Ben Brown is standing by himself under no pressure!!!! #AFLNorthLions
Any way @FOXFootyLive could just let huddo commentate by himself and piss off the other clowns??? #AFLNorthLions
Sandy Roberts, such a positive commentator. #PissofSandy #Jerk @FOXFootyLive
Disappointed, but not losing hope. We've come back from worse situations. Knuckle down boys. #GOLIONS #Prideinthejumper #AFLNorthLions
North playing like they have 20 men on the field. #AFLNorthLions
McGrath and Taylor can hold their heads high at the moment. They are giving it everything. #AFLNorthLions
Mitch is finding his feet in the new jumper today. #GOLIONS #AFLNorthLions
Good start boys. Keep up the intensity. #Golions #AFLNorthLions
Let's go Lions. Bring it on. #GOLIONS #Prideinthejumper #AFLNorthLions
Dear @PAFC please refrain from getting a DJ at @TheAdelaideOval again. That was bloody awful.
I think it's obvious the Suns had already ticked that game off as a win and didn't expect a contest. Any team can beat anyone at any stage.
Trengove's 100th game tonight reminds me of his first 85.......
Shocking!
#AFLPowerSwans
Yep, it is obviously McKenna's fault. #AFLSunsSaints
Cracking day at Unley for the first @SturtFC home game today. #GoBlues http://t.co/vMaSzUG1GN
Going through both teams from tonights next 4 games, the @FOXFootyLive "experts" have ticked us to lose to both teams. #wankers
Butcher with 3gls 9 marks at 3qtr time for the Port Maggies. Wants his spot back! #TheRecruit Joey Wagner with 2gls.
Got a long day ahead tomorrow, but still want to sit up watching #TheMasters all night. Love watching #Speith play.
Great goal Everitt #AFLEaglesBlues
2 supergoals to start the night.

...oh wait 
#AFLEaglesBlues
I'm excited by this @brisbanelions team. Just like I was in 98'. And no Media "Expert" can take that from me. #bigthingscoming #GOLIONS
People please! If you play poorly, you play reserves. Nothing more to it than that. #performorperish #strongstance #GOLIONS
Congrats and good luck this weekend @zac_oby. Very deserved. Tear it up out there on Sunday. #GOLIONS #PrideIntheJumper
Richie probably never got the chance to tell Warnie he's a shithouse commentator.
R.I.P Richie. Cricket will never be the same.
Would like to think Goose will be in the team this week.
Congrats @meglanning7 great reward for all your hard work.
34yrs young today and all I want to do is sleep. #oldmansyndrome
Kaymden McIntosh, no suprises there. The guy played a blinder! #RisingStar
Fingers crossed for @madirobinson_ hoping for some good news. #ANZChampionship
This game is going as expected. #Neckandneck #Alwaysclose #AFLHawksCats
Rd1 Likes: The Crows and The debut of Aaron Vadenberg for the Dees
Dislikes: The Season ending injuries and ANZ Stadiums surface.
Having suffered a pneumothorax a few times in life, I felt your pain last night @rockwiz38. Take it easy big fella, rest up. #GOLIONS
BUTCH!!!! Great goal big fella. Wonder how much that was paying. #AFLFreoPower
Roos will be out for blood on the back of that thrashing. Feel sorry for whoever plays them next week.
.........................oh crap!
Hoping big Nick Reiwoldt is ok. Didn't look great. #AFLSaintsGiants
Well this is getting embarrassing. #AFLCrowsNorth
While it was a great fightback last night, they should never have let the Pies get that far infront. Lots to work on, bring on R2.#GOLIONS
Disappointing to lose but a Fantastic last qtr by the @brisbanelions, alot to build on. Great debut by @jadenmcgrath. #GOLIONS
Boys obviously all took turns rubbing baby oil on Stef Martins muscles, because none of them can hold onto the ball. #AFLLionsPies #GOLIONS
Wow! This Cooney fella could be a star one day. #AFLSwansDons #vintageform
Not a bad goal Cooney. #AFLSwansDons #nicedob
Said it before and I'll say it again. What a terrible bloody ground @ANZStadium is for @AFL football. #disgrace
Power fans knew what Newton was capable of. Now has his chance at Melbourne and making the most of it. Great game Newts #AFLDeesSuns
I don't care that I got this tip wrong. Melbourne deserve this win. Great team game by the Dees. #AFLDeesSuns
Gary Lyon would have very erect nipples right now. #AFLDeesSuns
Footy can be a cruel game. Really feel for @jaegeromeara and @TyVickery29. Recover quickly guys.
Bang! Well done @cleve_stark http://t.co/b6uXDTdIed
Good luck tonight to the mighty @SturtFC. Been a long off season, be great to start off 2015 with a win over the Legs. #GoDoubleBlues
The debut of @jadenmcgrath, the beginning of a superstar. Going to be an exciting night. #GOLIONS #PrideintheJumper
Experts all pick Suns to play finals, but lose to a team they put as bottom 4 this weekend. #makesnosense #typicalVicbias
Ladder order 2015, Haw, Port, Syd, Adel, Rich, NM, Gee, GC, BL, Freo, Ess, WC, GWS,  Coll, WB, Carl, StK, Melb.
Joy, Peace &amp; happiness. All the reasons my face hurts from smiling after another beautiful @mavisstaples show. Myself and Adelaide thank u.
