Smith lunging at Tredwell. Short extra might be in play if one sticks in the wicket a little. #WIvEng
Dragged down and easy for Smith to pull in front of square for 4 more. #WIvEng
Going to be weird seeing the @WorldSnooker1 without these guys. Not right. https://t.co/ABlYTIEoPk
Nice from Bravo. On top of the bounce, picked the gap for a couple. Pitch just looks very dead. Time for Tricky I think. #WIvEng
Another lovely extra cover drive by Bravo. Shows how good the wicket is, you can just play through the line of the ball. #WIvEng
If someone's profile was oxymoronic it'd look like this I think... http://t.co/7tguaJPYFE
Classic off drive by Bravo. He's a delight to watch. Lovely extension of the elbows. Pure elegance. #WIvEng
If my feed is anything to go by then Farage is losing the debate. This pleases me.
Did you guys have this beauty? @Capt_Fishpaste @richy3393  https://t.co/uruJPe5kIs
Ukippers won't like that. Then again they don't like facing the truth.  https://t.co/cW9zAMQ5hG
One for those who say Jimmy is overrated and a one trick pony... https://t.co/iQWsu9Qfhv
Top over from Tricky there. #WIvEng
Excellent bouncer from Broad but could have ducked that. #WIvEng
Pitched outside leg, contact outside leg and going down leg. Apart from that, plumb... #WIvEng
Look at Cook on the balcony. Not a sign of a man close to declaring. #WIvEng
Wouldn't surprise me if England bat till tea. We've always been cautious and safe when setting targets. #WIvEng
I'm sad to say I've dropped an even bigger dolly than that! #WIvEng
That's a Mohammad Amir no ball... #WIvEng
How low can UKIP go? Using the poppy to win votes is shocking on many levels. Shame on them. http://t.co/ijILLivX12
Launched over long on for 6 by Jos. 400 lead up. Hit that sweetly. #WIvEng
I'd comment on this but then I don't want to get sued! https://t.co/BvOZnPPZ7D
Yes get in Gazza! Well played lad. #WIvEng
Someone with the plate LHO is tailing him closely.. https://t.co/yGM3Q6stWO
Early days but as far as England goes, number 3 company don't come much better than Barrington and Wally! https://t.co/m9nDoTXlD3
Mugs indeed! Gazza's quality. We'll see in the summer if he's a test #3. More suited to the middle order for me. https://t.co/ZBFTkhvMYC

Oh fucking hell Cook what a truly awful shot.
Cracking delivery. Two failures in the match for Trott. #WIvEng
Lovely pick up by Cook. Rarely misses out on that shot. So natural to him. #WIvEng
Is it me or did @Wardyskycricket just call Athers "Altherton"?
Only 15 day. That's reason for optimism ain't it? @MetsFanInPhilly I was worried it be longer. https://t.co/wZ49JS5AH3

Man back at backward square leg. On this pitch that is a pointless fielding position. #WIvEng
Overpitched, no swing and a flourish through the line from Blackwood. #WIvENG
Lovely over from Tredders that. Does mix his pace and lengths well. #WIvEng
That's why we're the Champions! Made of strong stuff. What a superb, resilient bunch we have. #strongunit  https://t.co/5iZPJNdhys
Tricky Tredders on. I like him as a bowler. Understands his art. Like Gower says, changes pace and length well. #WIvEng
Average bowling. Leg stump short ball on a slow pitch. Poor. Easy for the crabby bastard to swot away. #WIvEng
The smooth talking Jeffrey Dujon on commentary now. Sweet. #WIvEng
I'll get a season ticket at Vale before that happens! Never! #Quitterill  https://t.co/PXPYjI5BUS
That's lovely from Stokes. 4th, 5th stump, seaming in, just misses the edge. #WIvEng
Blackwood living a charmed life here. Looks a bit poor.
This! Plunkett is much more awkward to face I imagine. Quicker and bowls more wicket taking deliveries. https://t.co/DH49pIZray
You're angry Stokes, but it's your own fault lad. Get behind the line!
Stokes!!! Fucks sake! Why do they have to be that close?!
Casillas very shaky there. Real will take a draw now. Atletico ending well here.
Brentford losing üëéüèª
Simeone needs to get Mandzukic off. Walking red.
Typical Darren Bravo. Somehow finds a way of getting himself out when looking comfortable. #WIvEng
This is a poor Windies team but Darren Bravo is genuine quality. Very aesthetically pleasing when he's at his best. #WIvEng
Jaffer from Jimmy that. Pitched middle and leg, swings, gets the outside edge and Buttler completes the job. 3 more for the record. #WIvEng
Hope it's not serious. Get well soon Finchy!  https://t.co/nnBMbMvstY
What a change around from this time yesterday. That's what champions are made of. Get in @Yorkshireccc! #COYT #strongunit

Patto you beauty!!!!! @WorcsCCC have a good lower order so this is not anywhere near over. Keep plugging away lads! https://t.co/VQsjv0EqF3
Yes get in Patto! Big wicket. https://t.co/DCMJGqy9cg
Get in! @BrooksyFerret on fire! https://t.co/WowZJFi2re
Another big wicket. Great start. https://t.co/rrQKBHlkB4
Huge wicket that is! #COYT https://t.co/bIexXELlwO

Great effort from the perilous position we were in. 1 inning match now. https://t.co/MiQCA0GuEi
Beauty from Roach, pitched, seamed, bounced more than expected also. Nothing Bell could do there, absolutely gorgeous ball. #WIvEng
He can take wickets but he does bowl an awful lot of "hit me" deliveries at the moment. Hopefully Otis Gibson can be effective with him.
Batting wise @ECB_cricket have a lot of young talent, bowling not so much, which is why we need Stokes to improve that side of his game.
And we were going less than 2 an over after the first session...#WIvENG  https://t.co/iOQp5XcZtl
Too short and wide, easy cut behind square for Stokes for 4. #WIvENG
Too straight and comfortably clipped away for a couple from Bell. Moves to 136 and @ECB_cricket to 328-4. 3 overs left today. #WIvENG
The very thought of Stokes and Buttler together in the middle. Oh my goodness... https://t.co/DBZl20OwI7
That is even more Bell like than the late cut. Beautifully timed cover drive, barely hit it for 4, followed by a cut through the slips.
Very Bell-like late cut that, iffy fielding and it's two more. #WIvEng
If any country can, England can! https://t.co/I7KmHtEAYk
This, ladies and gentlemen, is why Stokes is so well thought of. Yes it's a flat deck and an awful attack but this kid can play. #Natural
That's the best of the lot. Over pitched and an exquisite straight drive through mid on. Pure elegance. Gorgeous from Stokes. #WIvEng
Around the wicket, too short and Stokes rocks back, loads of time and dispatches a pull for 4. #WIvEng
Too much width and a flamboyant square drive by Stokes for 4 more. He is wonderful to watch when he's like this. #WIvEng
Over pitched and worked through the covers for 2 by Stokes as @ECB_cricket pass 300. #WIvEng
Poked between mid off and cover by Stokes for 3, goes to his 50 off 59 balls. This is what we want to see from Stokes. #WIvEng
Harsh call on the no ball by Steve Davis there. Certainly close but looked to be behind the line to me. #WIvEng
Bell timing it very sweetly out there. When he plays like this, he is simply a delight to watch. #WIvEng
Wide but smashed beautifully by Stokes. Hands through the ball wonderfully, slightly blended knee. Very nice to watch. #WIvEng
Not bad... @xxToriaxx @MetsViews @MetsFanInPhilly  https://t.co/Aaby0aPO3e
Leg side but lovely roll of the wrists, keeping it down. Nice from Stokes. Bloody awful delivery mind. #WIvEng
Sat up and asked to be hit that did. #WIvEng
My cat trying to eat a hanger. The norm...
Wasted review by the Windies there.
This has been said many times before... https://t.co/JWMhChsmx1
Gone for a review. Height the issue I think.
100 for Bell. @ECB_cricket needed that from him!
Now, over to the cricket.
Lined to centre, Lagares...you know the rest. #Mets win 2-0! Mets win their home opener. Go to 4-3.
Double play! Sweet! Just what was needed. Two on, no out. Final out. Asche up. #Mets
Lead off walk from Familia. Hmmph! Homer here ties the game. Familia with work to do here. #Mets
2-0 #Mets into the 9th. Can Familia secure save and win for De Grom?
TDA to shallow left. Cuddyer tags up and makes home comfortably. 2-0 #Mets. Murphy tagged to 2nd. Curiously  they're walking Lagares.
Single to centre and Murphy pulls it straight to Utley for a perfect DP ball but goes through his legs. Men on corners, 1 out. Chance. #Mets
1-2-3 inning for Blevins. Still 1-0 #Mets, bottom 8.
