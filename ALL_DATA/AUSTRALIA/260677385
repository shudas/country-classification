Another week, plenty of time to PRESS PLAY on the DVR and watch an episode of #Salem so good you have to watch more than once. @SalemWGNA 😈
That's the thing with Shane's movies.  You can't watch a movie and be done -  it always has to be a minimum of three for me. #WESTAHOLIC
Just saw #RedSands after a great episode of #Salem.  Brilliant.  Loved the twist at the end.  Another amazing performance @shanewest 😈😱👏
That's the second time I've seen Shane slit a throat today 😲😈 #RedSands #Salem
#NowWatching #RedSands 😈
Have the urge to watch #Supernatural &amp; then #RedSands tonight.  Yeah, Mondays are creepy like that 😈😬😵
