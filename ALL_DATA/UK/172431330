Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Fucking cunt
Fucking family do my fucking head in! I will not be controlled by anyone
If your vegan that's cool, just don't expect me not to eat bacon around you
Someone hands me a leaflet saying "friend or food" and a picture of a pig. I say food, his face charges like I killed his best friend hahaha
I didn't record MOTD, For fucks sake
my biggest hate is when you see 15 year old boys putting photos online with the same bottle of drink? These cunts still get pocket money  üòÇ
why do guys at party's in particular bring bottles of drink to just stunt and hand it out to yats, like you think there gonna fuck you?
Fuck boys
Basically, if you are drunk just enjoy it. Dont stunt on twitter to make yourself look "cool". Just enjoy people's company around you
Just witnessed some prick down a bottle of vodka, says I'm not drunk and I then falls down a flight of stairs. CUNT
#DrunkTimesWithJosh
If I'm pissed, I will say I'm drunk straight up. Not these fuck boys that want to act "hard" when inside they can't even hold a conversation
I swear when people drink on my timeline, they tweet like an idiot to just get attention for thirsty cunts.
I don't know why, but why is it so hard for people to tweet with perfect grammar? It's like they do it on fucking purpose!
So drunk right now, I'm amazed that I'm able to tweet with perfect grammar.
Andy Murray is still a cunt

Listening to 4 guys speak in another language for 6 hours is not fun at all. Being hungover isn't helping aswell
