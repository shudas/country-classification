I don't get hints, just tell me straight up😩👏💯
Before you talk, listen. Before you react, think. Before you criticize, wait. Before you forget, forgive. And before you quit, try.
If you want them, show them. If you need them, tell them. If you get them, show them off. If they're worth it, fight for them.
Do You Care?
He Don't Wanna No Mediocre Ma! 😂😅
Ain't nothing changed... 😘 @ TBT https://t.co/KwvSaRSjIC
That feeling when you're hoping that one person is going to text you.
Grab her ass when you see her
Do you feel trapped?

you know what you want to do, but you're afraid of what others think?

Here's a tip: Fuck Opinions
I constantly tell myself ''I'm done'' but then I find myself trying again.
Can today just be over please 😩
Never bring OLD problems into a NEW relationship.
Cause all of my kindness, is taken for weakness
Never

Ready For These Summer Festivities 🙌😁
Be happy. Be who you wanna be. If others doesn’t like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn’t about pleasing everybody.

Priceless 😍😍 https://t.co/q3ogRKranK
Why Am I Up?
It's hard to move on, when memories are pulling you back.
Lie to me and watch how fast I lose interest.
I didn't change... I just realized some shit.
Nothing was perfect, but everything was real.
#RT if somebody is on your mind..
I'm hopeless, but hoping.
If you don't appreciate her... Someone else will.
Bro's before hoes, not bro's over your girlfriend...
Feeling unwanted sucks.
I distance myself from people for a reason.
I hate arguing, but I hate holding shit in..
Us Short girls are the cutest..
I want the old you back.
Loyal girls deserve the World. 🌎❤
Holding a girls hand in public is just another way of saying you're proud to have her.
A relationship where you can be weird together &gt;
I miss you.. I miss us.
I’m not perfect, but I’m loyal. 👌
If only you knew how much I think about you.
Be real with me or just leave me alone.
i want a REALationship..
I trusted you, my mistake..
If she's important to you, show her.
I want my 1st marriage to be my ONLY marriage.
My ex made my standards even higher..
You bring out the best in me.
Go for someone who is proud to have you.
I wonder if I’ve met the person I’m going to marry
Retweeting a tweet to secretly send someone a message.
Don’t rush anything. When the time is right, it’ll happen.
I keep a lot of shit to myself because in reality nobody really gives a fuck.
Real girlfriend will be on your ass, text you everyday, fight with you, cares about you, listens to you, and loves you like no hoe has.
My biggest fear is losing my mother..
Me , You. Forever. Please?
Single or taken, you still get hurt.
Yes I changed. Pain does that to people..
Fuck you. Fuck Her. Fuck your lies. Fuck the memories. Fuck everything actually.
I'm not the person I used to be. I admit, a lot of shit got to me.
everything is so temporary nowadays
i hate loud people in the morning😒
A smart girl leaves, before she is left.
Hold me tighter, kiss me longer, love me harder, and I'll be yours forever.
I want you. Nothing else, just you.
I’m shy. Until you get to know me.
"I love you" &gt; "Love you"
I don't understand our relationship. Sometimes, we're friends. Sometimes, we're more then friends. Other times, I'm just a stranger to you.
Everything happens for a reason. Positive or negative. You create the meaning for yourself.
No words can explain how I feel about you, but sometimes I wonder how you feel about me.
When she ignores you, that's when you need to talk to her the most.
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.. Who am I kidding, I do care, I care too much..
I wanna grow old with the one I love ♥
Be happy. Be who you wanna be. If others doesn't like it, then let them be. Happiness is a choice. Life isn't about pleasing everybody.
When I text you it means I'm missing you. When I don't it means I'm waiting for you to miss me. If only you knew.
Don't call me "Boo", "Baby", "Babe", or "Love" unless I’m the ONLY ONE you're calling that.
Once I get you, I don't plan on losing you.
I don't care if we talk about absolutely nothing, I just want to talk to you.
Before I met you, I never knew what it was like to be able to look at someone and smile for no reason.
I can't lie, I miss you..
I once had a best friend now that hoe a stranger.
All relationships go through shit, real relationships get through shit.
if I'm weird around you, that means I'm comfortable with you..
Silly me, I thought you actually cared.
Can we go back to the way we used to be?
I really want you to really want me.
The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging, and you have to act like you don't care at all.
When I fell for you, I fell hard..
Overthinking when you're laying in bed at night.
Sometimes I push you away, because i need you to pull me closer.
I need more sleep &amp; more money 💰
I'd rather for you to keep it real with me &amp; tell me what's up. Don't have me out here looking stupid.
Even if I spend the whole day with you, I miss you the second you leave.
To break someone's heart is just heartless.
I can text fast as hell when I am mad.
If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't get so mad at the things you do.
You're kinda, sorta, basically, pretty much always on my mind.
don't expect too much &amp; maybe you won't end up disappointed anymore
😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/bmiGaBwJWg
Sometimes I push you away, because i need you to pull me closer.

A "wifey type" has nothing to do with rolling blunts/cooking.. It's more like a woman that takes care of you, loves you &amp; stands by ur side
Virginity and Trust. Once you lose it, you'll never get it back.
I'm not the type you wanna screw things up with
if you trynna flirt with a girl don't fucking hit the girl goddamnit.
My Love 💕 @wild6oy_G http://t.co/NV7zaCds1S
i cherish you
i just want you all to myself...
It's rare to meet someone with a mind that's just as beautiful as their face
"I been peeped that you like me, you know. Who tf you really wanna be with besides me? I mean..." 😉 https://t.co/UVjyRfougP
Relationships ain't even that hard. People just don't know how to be loyal anymore.
If you got somebody who will ride through thick &amp; thin and hold it down for you, don't ever play them. You'll end up playing yourself.
I keep a lot of shit to myself because in reality nobody really gives a fuck.
Don't be the girl who needs a man. Be the girl a man needs.
I always want to correct people when they have a typo on Twitter but individuals are so soft nowadays 😳🌾
It scares me how much I think about you.
I want you... 😘 No secrets... 🙅 No games... 😒 No lies... 👋
When you highkey want someone but you tryna be lowkey
Been through a lot in my life but I'm thankful that it happened because if not for the ups and downs I'm not who I am today. Beyond blessed!
I'm done trying. If you want me in your life, let me know. @wild6oy_G

Stop regretting things you cant change.
Can I borrow a kiss? I promise I'll give it back.
if I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that sh!t.
I felt special. Until I realized you talk to everybody like that.
Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person.
I dont hate you, I never will. I just act like I do, because its easier than admitting that I miss you.
Nothing hurts more than being disappointed by the single person you thought would never hurt you
I hate liars, hypocrites and people who take advantage of people who care about them.
Don't pretend you care when you don't.
No matter how much you have changed, I still remember the old you.
I wish my feelings had a delete button..
When a girl cries, it's not usually over one thing. It's built up anger and emotions that she's been holding in for too long.
Sometimes you have to walk away from people, not because you dont care, but because they don't.
When I fell for you, I fell hard..
The worst feeling is when someone makes you feel special, then suddenly leaves you hanging, and you have to act like you don't care at all.
I Guess I'm Be Single For A While! That's what's best
Buenos días! 😍😍😍 https://t.co/8AVpC85MJE
Getting a lot of girls isn't something to be proud of, keeping one is.
Yea I'm That Girl! 😉😍 http://t.co/40iO5cPeAl
my problem is giving people my all and expecting them to do the same
I just want a loyal person in my life.
Is it possible to be in love with impossibility?
Cookie Jam Making Me So Mad! 😠😠

"Netflix cheating" is watching an episode alone when you have promised someone to watch it together.

I'm pretty sure a few ppl got me blocked, but I'll never know bc I don't be checking for em 💁
Being ignored by someone whose attention means the world to you is the worst feeling.
Do what you did in the beginning of the relationship and there won't be an end 💑💍💕👫
Stop stressing over people who arent stressing on you!!
When I was a kid, I hated going to bed. Now I cherish every hour of sleep.
Send her a cute goodnight text while she's sleeping so she wakes up with a smile on her face. Please @wild6oy_G
Girls need love, attention, faith, sincerity &amp; boys need to understand it.
you did me dirty and i still stuck by your side, don’t know if i was stupid or the definition of a real ride or die.
Be the girl that everybody wants &amp; only one boy got 👌🏾💯
Idc what nobody say GIRLS with tattoos are the best 😊💯
Make you fall in love , typa shit that I do 😊🙈
Being in love is such a beautiful thing
Constant battle between what my heart wants and what my mind knows is right
I'm selfish cause I want you to myself
Please tell me that!  https://t.co/w4CMQjNR3N
I really don't like the idea of anyone else having you.. 😒
Real girlfriend will be on your ass, text you everyday, fight with you, cares about you, listens to you, and loves you like no girl has.
The hardest part is learning to live without you. I miss you Jarmelle. ❤️ @ Heavn https://t.co/C33AH59tfB
