HOORAH *pushes back colouring appt by another two weeks*
Good news today for financially stretched fake blondes everywhere: my hairdresser says roots are in!!!
Roxane Gay: 'Rape humour is designed to remind women that they are still not quite equal.'
For a desert island, isn't there quite a lot of rubbish on this beach? #theisland
Absolutely disgusted that Farage is against our NHS helping foreigners with HIV. Get a sense of compassion. #LeaderDebates
I like when my puppy walks past me and just licks me once on each leg, then carries on. It's cos she loves me.
I could act better than Ed Balls in this. #Coalition
I really hope C4's #Coalition is realistic because I will be using quotes and examples from it in my finals.
I've said it before and I'll say it again - home &gt; library because of the excellent service. http://t.co/8Tuaky087x
I just bloody love politics. I can't wait for the election.
'Have you ever had three shredded wheat?' 'I have actually, but that was a long time ago.'
Can I just say @asda - white chocolate and caramel hot cross buns are 100% not okay
Like Odysseus tying himself to the mast, my new tactic is to not replace makeup as it runs out so I don't even have the CHOICE to go out
Got home seven hours ago and now I am actually watching Countryfile. I don't think we're in Oxford any more, Toto.
Far too many people walking in and out of the library today. It's very annoying. May suggest designated entering/leaving times.
I'm having a crisis in economics where I'm just not sure I believe in curves any more and they're quite important
Not sure how long I can go on without biscuits
The moment that it becomes clear that you're going to need a second trip to tesco after mistakenly resisting the chocolate biscuits at first

Just had to watch my puppy run around the house looking everywhere for me after she heard me on Skype #heartbreaking #crieevrytiem
Yeah I think we noticed, thanks Facebook. http://t.co/sk2TCUrfmp
eFlorist. Why do I even subscribe to you? http://t.co/zvc8LUIvcv
Getting to be quite a connoisseur of rain noise soundtracks now. Currently enjoying one that includes an ocean. Lovely.
Et tu, Waitrose. http://t.co/srZFMLz2W0
Awkward that two of my tweets from yesterday start 'can we just'. Sorry Twitter
Can someone please bring me chicken nuggets I will cry with gratitude
It's last call for LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE NOW http://t.co/tki2zlA8zw
Can we just all look at the example of how to advertise for this day properly please http://t.co/HR510xwnoj

Can't we just assume everyone knows about Valentine's Day and can sort it out themselves? http://t.co/HODtTX0tIU
Next in my series of annoying emails about Valentines Day... The White Company! I thought you were better than that. http://t.co/rfJ13qcWPC
I can't understand why more people don't know about First Defence and no one ever listens to how great it is. No one should have colds, ever
PayPal too. http://t.co/slZf0BUpTL
And now ticketmaster. Thanks ticketmaster. http://t.co/KpTsUs8HmG
NO I DO NOT Natwest leave me alone http://t.co/7azt7Q5ZIQ
I have discovered a comedy show about female suffrage. Has there ever been a better thing, ever?
It's awkward when you accidentally go on tinder during a tinder date because they can literally see when you go on tinder. #tinder
'But NO' the masses cry, 'he was SO resilient in the face of political correctness/ non-outrightly-offensive demands and that is BRITISH'
Not sure if it's okay to say this but please can we get over Winston Churchill? I think he might have just been quite rude
Do we just do this now? Apostrophes after capitals? I'm still not okay with it http://t.co/vHfrz2HxE8
Eastenders is really knocking those controversial stories out of the park at the moment.
My very musical cousin and his band Fallen to Flux have a new EP out today - make sure you listen #FTOLI
Another thing to hate about snow: that really horrible dirty gritty stuff they put down days before it even comes to stop people slipping.
The laptop next to me without a person is in serious danger if it doesn't start making a lot less noise right now
Why has JK Rowling had to condemn Murdoch's attacks on Islam? Can't we just assume people don't hate Islam until they say they do?
Thoughts are with everyone affected or scared in France today. #JeSuisAhmed
Change in highlighter colour halfway through a period of revision shown to increase concentration threefold

Oh, the number at the end of the date changed. Shall we continue with our lives now world?
I don't want to panic everyone... But I may have FOUND A NEW MAKE OF JEANS THAT FIT ME
http://t.co/sofrhC2m5j Apparently the BBC has a pro-gay bias... As opposed to being neutral as to whether people have rights?
Went to the sales and got a half price set of reed diffusers. One of these days I'll crack the clothes shopping thing.
Bali didn't like this box. http://t.co/O41cTyysbn
I think Tony Abbott is the best secret weapon @LetToysBeToys have got #ThanksTony
Just got six likes (without being blocked) for a comment on Cuntry Living. My feminist certificate will be arriving soon.
Also WHY DID NO-ONE RETWEET THE THING ABOUT ME BEING ON TV I thought it was really cool
Just seen Glen from Walking Dead appear and say two lines in Big Bang Theory. I LOVE HIM IN THIS TOO
I was on TV today. That's all.
So thrilled to receive so much support for @LetToysBeToys and their work tonight - I hope Christ Church #shopoutsidethebox this year.
Just have to say how much I have admired @WillNeaverson and his principles and bravery this week. V proud to call him a colleague and friend
And then Oxford split in two and neither side ever spoke to the other again. #futurehistorybooks
Pretty sure this Youtube white noise puts really quiet stuff in the background just to fuck with you.
Wait - who's dead? http://t.co/BsKABzcPq6
I think my puppy is glad to have me home because she keeps biting all different bits of me and my clothing.
Why are so many more people in jail in the US than other places? Had no idea this was such a stark difference.
Sitting outside the library in the cold to watch #montythepenguin. So very worth it, but 2011 still hasn't been beaten.
OH MY GOD MY PUPPY IS COMING
Oh phone it's so good to have you back never leave me again
Why do we keep lending pens to people? Haven't we learnt yet that they just never give them back?
Saw Gone Girl last night. Left with friend both feeling weird and scared. Checked room for psychopaths before I went to sleep. Great film.
Please please stop saying expresso #Apprentice
Oh hey there first person in the library. It's much better when there's no-one else in it. http://t.co/lrFUnIOAnF
What. On Earth. Do these pictures mean? http://t.co/Oe1dO03Gsv
Such subtle sexism - men are more 'responsive', not eg more volatile. http://t.co/PraLWD5y1B
OR AT LEAST SOME HARMONIES. COME ON NOW
For instance - the new group on X Factor. There are eight of you. You have no excuse not to be singing a cappella.
Think it's going to take me a while to like music that's not a cappella again.
Just got yelled at on street from a white van - it's okay though, they were just letting me know I've got a ladder in my tights. Thoughtful.
Why are MPs being recalled to vote on air strikes? Isn't this is a traditional power of the executive? No precedent for this before Blair.
This old dog doesn't want you to know but she's secretly still really into playing and chasing. http://t.co/zLQyyl5hKg
Can someone explain to me the point of giving Scotland full tax-raising powers when they never used Tartan Tax capabilities at all?
Very overdressed for date with @RobbieMallett. #sparkles
There is very little in life so joyous as a puppy running towards you.
#neighbourstornado why do people keep going out in this storm? It would be much safer if everyone just stayed in the dry
Reinstalled snapchat - still have a vid from @r_osiemai that I can't open. What now @RobbieMallett?
Literally about to write a report on 'What I Did On My Summer Holiday.' Some things never change.
