Barnett can't see even a private jet is part of a much bigger picture &amp; betrays a trend #abcnews24
Barnett is a grub. Your budget includes forecasting so you should've seen it coming &amp; flying private jets doesn't help #abcnews24

Your money is being rorted offshore by big companies #insiders
WA has reaped rewards of mining boom &amp; assumed it would go on &amp; on &amp; mismanaged their budgets as a result &amp; are now bleating #insiders

#RedfernNow was deadly - awesome work.
Close the corporate tax loop hole. If there are such clever taxation brains helping companies take money offshore ATO should employ them.
Why should the rest of us pay for WA mismanagement of their budget #noGSTrise #abcnews24
WA have built their magic pudding budget on iron ore! Perhaps they should have built it on real income instead of sky pies #abcnews24
Is #MH370 in the Maldivian ocean? Imagine if it was!
24 &amp; sunny all weekend means irrigation trenching üòù
Looks like the rain is in for the day. No work done on the farm today but the bonus is that the 3 x 22,500 LTR tanks are getting filled :-)
Happy Zombie Sunday üê∞üê£üêìüíê
Drugging kids on long car journeys seriously! Just to make parents lives more pleasant? Haven't these ppl heard of books &amp; toys #abcnews24
Today is another farm day üòé
Not everyone in Australia is Christian &amp; therefore why do they have to put up with ideas they don't buy in to? #abcnews24
Christians don't have to shop or watch sport on ur religious days but rest of us don't have to put up with your crackpot ideas #abcnews24
So no Christians watched TV yesterday then cos that's leisure &amp; pleasure on Zombie day! #abcnews24
I'm not religious &amp; I do have a voice &amp; I don't care whether u don't want sport on any of ur specific days u R now a small voice #abcnews24
Can u believe the hypocrites! So all Christians are observing none Christian holidays &amp; festivals are they #abcnews24
Some ppl are beyond transparent.
If u abuse ppl on your way up don't be surprised when they shit on u on your way down üòÖ
It's international zombie weekend isn't it!
Shall be putting in more paddock fencing today üòé
Apparently it's a religious holiday today so all denominations will be taking advantage of that whether they practice sheeplism or not!!!!!
New Nigerian govt to crack down on corruption err horse, stable door, bolted!

How awesome is this :-) http://t.co/Yqpy74tMBW
Today we built a fence and I'm truly stoked about it :-) http://t.co/2mefUe3toN
NSW was never in doubt bcos bogans believe a conservative vote puts them in a higher social class proven when down pub brag they voted LNP!
Said #OneHD Greg Rust was bad but now we know just how bad. Looks like Foxtel sport package ever more likely at the farm.
Ch10 &amp; #OneHD kept quiet on losing rights 2 F1 didn't they! Now only broadcasting 10 of 20 rounds live with hr long Monday shows for rest!
Ever thought during an extreme turbulence event or very bumpy approach that pilots value their lives too so they'll do everything 2B safe?
New ROPS - üòç http://t.co/WrPBBLIwXZ
It seems Mike Baird has a secret little deal going with the main Chinese electricity supplier!
Happened to shop in Myers while waiting for hubbie &amp; thought I'd explore his ideas b4 passing judgement #paleo http://t.co/E6P2sD2bCy
Be careful what u say abt food choices #paleo is a shed load better than a fast food "diet". But I wish they'd stop calling it paleo-diet!
Don't eat cereals, bread is a bloat, cakes-pastries are just fat &amp; sugar, can't stand rice or pasta. Caveman tag is a bit sad tho #paleo
I've never felt better #paleo. While I'm not a fan of #mkr least of all Pete,surely cutting out unhealthy fats &amp; processed food =good right?
Given I'm casein intolerant &amp; a diabetic of 30yrs my restricted vegan diet means I'm living on eggs, veggies, fruit, nuts &amp; seeds #paleo
Calvary Wakefield Hospital with the bestie.
Don't eat dairy as I'm casein intolerant &amp; I'm no longer interested in breads, rice, cereals they just bloat me up. Eggs, veggies &amp; fruit üòÉ
Why eat grains &amp; pulses &amp; breads they're just gut fillers. I'm all for balanced diet but really the carbs we get from fruit &amp; veg are enuf.
My son at 30 does not have sweet tooth, doesn't eat desserts &amp; enjoys plain meat &amp; 2 veggies! He's extremely healthy 3/3
Literally blended the meat with leftover veggies and warmed over pan hot water. Dessert was mashed banana or stewed fruit 2/3
In 1985 advice was give weaned baby whatever we were having. As we were fairly poor I cooked a roast most Sunday's which lasted 3-4 days 1/3
My son is me 30, healthy normal weight, no acne ever! So paleo is bad!
Does that mean I was guilty of trying to harm my boy with the paleo diet! Because that &amp; stewed fruit is all he got till he was about five!
When my boy went on to solids I used to blend (30 yrs ago they were blenders not food processors) whatever we were having - meat &amp; 2 veg!
There's something wrong with a country who's most exciting event for a century is an ECLIPSE! Ppl you're doing LIFE wrong!

Abbott's truth - Hockey has dug such a deep hole their solution is to pretend it's all gone away just by tripling deficit! #abcnews24
Abbott now claims "what deficit?" We've solved it, we're out the other side &amp; we did it! #abcnews24
Abbott's budget solution - if u can't get policies thru legislation &amp; cut main income from mining &amp; carbon taxes- just declare SOLVED.
Abbott's achievements so far? Bringing the dollar to its knees + .............................
Conman has had new batteries inserted this morning in his repeater box - #abcnews24
They're just in complete denial abt carbon &amp; mining taxes #abcnews24
Well I'm just not buying your handbags any more - said Elton! The unreal world of celebrity where all that matters is the label or brand.
Pyne's nah nah na nah nah approach to politics really does set him up for a punch in the face #abcnews24
It's CAN-AR-VON Virginia NOT CANA-VON from the Welsh city of the same name!#abcnews24
I didn't say all of NSW, I said most.
I think Baird is safe in NSW. I think most NSW voters are so thick they truly believe an LNP premier puts them in a higher social class.

Shorter Abbott: move to an infrastructure zone that we determine is a better lifestyle choice! Screw your 40,000 yr old culture #abcnews24
Barnett is an arsehole &amp; I can't believe he's still Premier of WA! #abcnews24
Abbott can live wherever he wants so why can't the indigenous ppl of Aus who've been here for 40,000+ yrs! #abcnews24
A simplistic comment from a simplistic PM, &amp; you expect something else? #abcnews24
Shorter Abbott: we don't condone lifestyle choices, we'll tell u how to spend your money #abcnews24
Dear @richardbranson they trafficked drugs are u saying that's OK? How abt picking on USA &amp; China who also have death penalty #abcnews24
As long as @JeremyClarkson directs his comments at adults not children or animals I don't care, he's what you allowed him to become (BBC).
Huge numbers of major horse racing transport trucks along the freeway yesterday for the Adelaide Cup. I'm not a horse racing fan.
Things we don't need on the farm = coffee pod machine, old high heat TVs, tumble dryer.
South Australia - it's the best, I love it so much.
Oh except full septic in, 75% plumbed, cabling first fix done! Gyproc &amp; insulation still waiting to be installed.
Coffee time. Nothing happened on build for 2 weeks! :-( http://t.co/YfNbRGAJbM
No sympathy really for those with free will &amp; choice. My sorrow lies solely with defenceless animals, they are the victims on this planet.
