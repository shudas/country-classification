Choosing to eat my dinner at a whole foods in Seattle was a terrible idea. These people are basically just mimicking NPR DJs.

More proof that Northwesterners r basically Canadian: They form a straight line at a bar instead of crowding it like entitled booz-monsters

Being on tour is significantly less awesome when you're in love with someone.

It's deeply extraordinary to be the recipient of unconditional love from the day you were born.
Sometimes I wish I could take life away from some people and give it to others.
I'm on the phone with Egon and he just convinced my mom and Gabrielle that you're pregnant. Classic. @crucialthanks

Boys of Summer is absolutely one of my favorite songs. Fun fact: not written by Don Henley but by Tom Petty's guitarist, Mike Campbell.
From now on if anyone asks why I left Philly I'm going to say "Well once the scene turned Emo I figured it was my time to go."
Is it wrong (morally &amp; factually inaccurate) that if I hear a word I only know from NWA, or other Ice Cube projects I am afraid of it?
The Indiana Jones ride was honestly one of the coolest things I've ever done.
Did not expect to drink this much in Disney Land.
