Is there an appropriate way to let someone know you just stalked them on every social media account they have?
When life hands you lemons, return them, and kindly ask for a better personality and a higher GPA.
The last time NC State won the National Championship they were a heavily underrated 6 seed.

Hmmmmm......
If I could live in an cartoon world it would hands down be Adventure Time. 📺
I would honestly rather have a perfect bracket than a perfect GPA.

May be irrational, or maybe I have my priorities in order
Farewell @DeShonWilliams_ @IJackson83 😔

The Big 12 cannot be trusted..
The Round of 64 is the reason I have trust issues..
Good thing I picked UAB to win in my 34th bracket that I made. 

No. That doesn't count

Constantly stuck between wanting to see the improbable upsets and wanting my bracket to be perfect. #CinderellaTeams

I personally believe all Football players at the collegiate level should be paid. 🏈
How "high key" does something have to be before it stops being "low key"? 

Is there "Semi low key"? "Nearly high key"?
Giving Andrew Luck a WR threat such as Andre Johnson is just a recipe for greatness. 

NFL watch out 🏈

Do what you want and let God do what you cant 🚶
I wouldn't be surprised if a NFL Franchise traded their entire team to another one in exchange for theirs.

This will then lead Deion Sanders to join the Broncos as well, who will convince Andre Johnson to sign too. Thus finishing the off season
