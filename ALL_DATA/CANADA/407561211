Watched my phone fly right out the window doing  50 on dewdney. Im sure it only survived because I put a @bclions phone case on yesterday
I just watched the @ISS fly over Pitt Meadows. Why did it look like it had a tail or it was towing something which then just disappeared?
I got truly courageous &amp; drove children to MetroTown today. I was awesome - almost like I knew what I was doing. A very good day.
Check out this article Iâ€™m reading using the BC Lions iPhone app!

Good afternoon @maryzilba. Hope your day is going GREAT. You are fabulous.
Let's hear you roar!!  BC Lions back home in BC Place this Wednesday   SOOO excited.
Watching Nathan on the West Block. Excellent explanations. So good to know we have you in Ottawa.
Hoping Jody Claman's "business" takes a nose dive after people of Vancouver discover what a delusional egotist she is
We will miss Finnchel but only for a couple of months. I predict they will return with a new season of Glee.
Nathan's photos prove we live in an amazing part of this great country. How will those photos change post-Enbridge?
How do I get rid of a porcupine that has taken up residence in our backyard?  I Prefer bears...
Spent time at lake with Leila and her friend today. Weinie roast and s'mores on a very windy beach. A good day
See you in Hamilton next november
Watching Travis on news tonight. GO LiONS!!!  I miss CFL
I may be entering a new phase in my electronic communication life. Can you hear me now?
