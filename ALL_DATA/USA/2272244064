Dammit @CD1025FM why u gotta remind me I'm not going to Matt &amp;Kim right as I leave work at 5???
Mark this up as awin for the good guys. Itd be great to see some NE Ohio studs commit to CSU in the wake of all this https://t.co/DqUQ5nyZ5z
There are some expertly delivered one liners in this new Daredevil show on Netflix
THEN they had the exact same vote 2 raise fees &amp; keep wrestling which passed overwhelmingly. So why is lax even relevant?  #SaveCSUWrestling
So CSU had a vote to raise student fees to add lax, got voted down, added it anyways and dropped wrestling #SaveCSUWrestling
"@CSUWrestling Referendum passed 967 yes votes out of 1,089 votes cast!!!!!
Thank you CSU Students

"@Gxas: I used to think emo concerts were a bunch of kids moping while a band plays. I was half-right." was it the half where a band played?
So I take it everyone in NE ohio is drinking already today #TribeOpener ?

anybody know where mat assignments are for yasar dogu? i dont want to miss the DT match @FloWrestling
They should have gotten @DiGiornoPizza  "@Hadzilla: When your girl say she ordered pizza but they deliver that gluten free shit"
Flying out after a banking industry confidence = no chance of being upgraded to 1st. Exit row with nobody in the middle seat is A-OK tho
I never thought that in 2015 I'd be tuning in to #RAW from a hotel room and see Snoop Dogg introduce Hulk hogan
When is march madness over? I'm ready for options again
Why is orlando a thing...?
I loved seeing the change up in finals order last night @ncaawrestling.You should do that every year to highlight the most anticipated match
Hoping to listen to some good #d1wrestle  coverage/analysis today to make up for these early ass flights I'm on
This is WAY too early to be at the airport on a Sunday
"@MallnOates: Sooo... What's next?" I feel like a tweeter without a purpose now...
Is logan dating kahleesee?
PLEASE let this not be be an injury default finish
High contrast in entrance music #d1wrestle
Brewer looked unstoppable "@Uncle_Nut: @BdollChair this dude is nasty. Sucks for jdj he is around another year"
Time to make some history #d1wrestle
And now... the match we've all been waiting for
Don't beat me up for that last tweet brewer... this is an offensive onslaught if I've ever seen one
"@ncaawrestling: Congrats to Ohio State's Nathan Tomasello, your 2015 NATIONAL CHAMP at 125! #d1wrestle http://t.co/YVLKIl6Nh4"
Nice pic Cody Brewer. Do you sit on your chair backwards too? #d1wrestle
Great advice @_LogieBear_  "you train with me" lol  @Franchise_Nate #d1wrestle
Great season and phenomenal tournament by Zeke Moisey. Hats off #d1wrestle
NATHAN FUCKIN TOMASELLO! !!!!

Dat voice doe...
IS JAGGERS WEARING AN F'ING TUXEDO JACKET WITH A WHITE BUTTON UP (ALL THE WAY)?!
Way to close out that period NATO #D1WRESTLE
"@PumpkinJack34: @BdollChair you watching this wrestling match? It's pretty wild. #loganstubler" goddammit brady
Looks like we owe @Uncle_Nut some cash.
Nutter up 3 points on me. Greg out early http://t.co/451BlFzryy
Premature put of bounds call there... #d1wrestle
Annnnnnd then he sounds like an idiot. #d1wrestle #icecreamgate
Great win for Kyven Gadson #d1wrestle.
Game time
Gabe dean out there looking like he stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night #d1wrestle
Let's go @Snyder_man45 !!!! @wrestlingbucks #d1wrestle
Case studies have shown that wrestling fans love travel websites and lawn care equipment
2 penalty points in 3 seconds for a national title. Brown said it best. #dirty I wanted to call him a "gamer" but the rules are the rules
Ho ly shit #d1wrestle
Lol "tanahaulics" just favorited my tweet about Stieber/Brown #d1wrestle
Brown needs to hit the tanning beds with logan #d1wrestle
IMAR so untame he eats his sandwiches bread inside/meat outside
Hit the #ChickenSink Walsh! #d1wrestle
So pumped for this Ian Miller/ IMAR match. O wait... they scored it how???? #d1wrestle
Is IMAR a real life AC Slater? That hair... from cali... just sayin'. #d1wrestle
#basic "@Uncle_Nut: @BdollChair lunatic fringe"
Habat with a STRONG mean mug in his pic #d1wrestle
Is there any way to mute all ncaa bball tweets for the next 3 hours??
I hope everyone watching #d1wrestle tonight is enjoying the arm wrestling on espn right now. Still haven't seen anyone eat a cigar yet
Where do you go about picking up @wrestlingbucks NATIONAL CHAMPS shirts? #d1wrestle????
GREAT tournament by @Courts1nSession!!! Go @wrestlingbucks #d1wrestle
Amazing scramble, but its bad 4wrestling to end with a coon win.  Finally a hwy pushing action &amp; he loses bc coon feeds him hips #d1wrestle
Gabe Dean's dad look like kevin james? #d1wrestle #mallcop
Double inside hip block??? Call stalling bro #d1wrestle
What % of challenges get overturned? #d1wrestle How about ones that the officials admit were wrong after the match?
Save college wrestling. Call fleeing the mat! #mikeevansSTALLS @TerryBrandsUSA
Man i cant wait to watch evans stand there and handfight... #d1wrestle
Boy, a IMAR/Miller final sure would have been exciting.... instead a 2-1 realbuto advances to finals... #d1wrestle
Thats got to be the first time ive ever seen a guy go 2-1 in real finished matches and make the @NCAAWRESTLING finals... #d1wrestle
Realbuto really earned thid finals berth... @ncaawrestling is a farce. You should be embarrassed.  #d1wrestle
Refs gotta be able to call stalling when it's happening #d1wrestle
I've said it once and I'll say it again... NATHAN FUCKING TOMASELLO!!!! @Franchise_Nate  #d1wrestle
There's still time to right your wrongs before the next session @ncaawrestling . #FreeIanMiller #D1WRESTLE
#FreeIanMiller
Precedent only goes so far. Make the right call. #d1wrestle #injustice "@tange131811: @zzsmiller @ncaawrestling just plain wrong"
Blaming KSU coaches staff for not challenging is like blaming a pedestrian for not dodging a car that went off the road Bad call #d1wrestle
Poorly done NCAA #d1wrestle rules committee. Make the right call.
This Cabell guy has yhe strongest blonde stache I've seen since Scott Player suited up for the Browns #D1WRESTLE
What is going on with the Miller match? I didn't see it but all buzz says he got robbed
Surprise surprise. Mike Evans winning another match with zero takedowns. Great stall in the hips #d1wrestle
It's on like Donkey Kong "@ChipotIe: @BdollChair Brandon grease me up pal and lets wrestle"
2015 #D1WRESTLE championships in a nutshell: Hunter Stieber &amp; Josh Kindig going 0-2 &amp; some unranked Jack kid from MD taking out giants. Nuts
Just getting caught up on things. Who is this Kevin Jack kid??!?!?!?!? #D1WRESTLE

Dark horse of the tourney for sure
"@MonkOfFunk149: Three more years! http://t.co/hD7qjso3Y0" lol
Did this long bro just throw his angle bands at the guy he just beat?
How about Maryland coming off a rough big 10 tourney and pulling off some upsets! #d1wrestle
Snyder rolling #d1wrestle
Courts is a double leg machine this round #d1wrestle
How is this round even more insane than round 1? I'm glad I only did a pick em rather than filling out brackets #d1wrestle
Wait we got BOJO/Palacio in the round of 16??? This is insane. When am I gonna find time to eat? #d1wrestle
How the hell did Murphy hop on one foot for 40+seconds??? Hats off to him but a rough one for the bucks. #d1wrestle
You've gotta admire the progress Purdue has made this year. It's also a big bonus when they take out Mizzou guys. Go Bucks! #MarchMatness
Cont... 
Them"how far do u have tOSU going?" 
Me: "I got Logan winning it, 7 AAs." 
Them: "huh?"
Every conversation I'm gonna have today: them: "did you fill out a bracket?" Me: "yep all 10 of them" them: "huh?"
So excited about #MarchMatness 

Today is the day. Go @wrestlingbucks
"@Uncle_Nut: @BdollChair i am just as impressed that Herbert had an 8-2 lead." Absolutely. He was cruising for a while
Damn. Just like that the truth gets it done. Gotta love seeing cradles making a comeback at this level from American guys #FPL5
Ed Ruth doesn't even need to shoot. He just lowers his level and his 8 foot wingspan takes care of the rest #FPL5
Old man strength #FPL5
Holy shit Jake Herbert #fpl5
Annnnd never mind #fpl5
Ruth looked a little frustrated with that push out #fpl5
Tuned in at just the right time. Let's see if Herbert's still got it. #fpl5
I think u mean that J Jaggers look "@WillieAtFLO: I guess the dudes in Austin are starting to go for the look like that pussy Macklemore."
I'm impartial about Christian Laettner
