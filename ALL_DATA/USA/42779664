Last night, I had a dream about running a 10k... Apparently my subconscious has big aspirations! 😁🏃
Anyone have a recommendation and/or a hookup on a rental car?
Ponder. Your receivers are not 10 feet tall, not are you as fast as you think you are. #PonderThat #MNvsGB #TNF
When it rains, it pours. I'm not referring to the weather.
