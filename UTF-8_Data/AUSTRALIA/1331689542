Society's idea of success is a man-made clusterfuck
People aren't born to work stable 9-5 jobs they hate to pay off debt they shouldn't have, we're born to experience shit and enjoy ourselves
If someone is earning less money but is genuinely happy in life, why are they classified as failures
Why is the idea of success measured in how much money you earn or how many people you're in charge of?
