I fucking hate finding my way around this stupid campus.
Typical male: "You're obsessed, go away, get over me, we're done!"
Typical male: *Casually follows you*
I'm walking to school because it is so unbelievably nice out.
Frequent mood. http://t.co/fRRJBTXS8w
There are billions of people in the world. Why forgive someone who hurts you intentionally and why forget it? No fuck that. Move right on.
Sometimes I get mad at the fact that I can't care about people the way I used to. And can't refrain from snapping on them.
Stitches &gt; Cheddar Bob &gt; Kiefer Marques &gt; Iggy Azalea &gt; Ray J &gt; Kanye West. Fuck with me. @ButDatAssDoe
The best way to avoid arguing is to stop doing things you know will cause an argument. LOGIC.
People who want to be "well known" should be more selective about what they are known for.
Treat me like a joke and I'll leave you like it's funny.
Thanks for understanding, lol.

I'm so happy 'cause today I found a trend, it's in Ardene's. It's so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause Kurt Cobain.

Too irritable for the library, too immature for quiet study.
Blocking people on Instagram is so badass! Like holy fuck! I can't see your selfies and observe what you ate for dinner? How. Will. I. Live?
Lol. Why do people "like" pictures of things and people that they do not actually even like?
For once, I just can't wait for Monday! I need to gym, tan, and study with @NataliePoulin!
All for PMA until it borders on ignorance.
