Why do I see @pimpino when I watch this?  https://t.co/XXubbVWxxk
Does anyone know how to scan a photo into a computer? This is urgent.
Guys, @BenG_Sports is my go-to when I talk about my life's problems. He's the real MVP.
Maybe PHHS just needs to do some team building exercises....
If you can't say it to their face, you shouldn't say it on social media.

A run! A run! 

Little late, boys.
Steve Physioc just told me it was the 6th inning. Now I'm very confused.
I have recently learned that @arios51 is important. Very important. Get well soon please.
What is this monkey business @Royals?
7-2 is still not terrible. 

But if I have to say tomorrow that 7-3 is still not terrible, I might be quite irritated.
The Twins.... THE TWINS.
Well. This is not ideal.
A hit would be cool.
VARGAS. WYD.
Precisely.   https://t.co/Mebi8AXjY5
Ever heard of a thing called school?  https://t.co/0YvOV59hff
I'll take that.
Gimme a triple, Paulo.
SAL SAL SAL SAL
I AM TRYING NOT TO SHOUT. AUTOCORRECT THAT, PHONE.
Vargas, you douche.
Prolly miss the first few innings. Unless she decides to be nice.

Maybe this is just me, but there's not really a reason to be up in arms about last night's loss. Pitching was there, offense wasn't. #Royals
Ned gonna take Gordon out after a 2-hit game? Prolly so....
Guys.... ðŸ˜ª http://t.co/sZvJeiwHdw
Hey @US_SportsBlog.... @KCBaller25 is genuinely upset that we stopped our podcast. He says it's worse than when they cancelled Full House.
Tough loss @Royals. Shake it off, and come back tomorrow ready to play. #CantWinThemAll
RECAP: Volquez's Sparkling Start not Enough, Royals Fall to 7-1.

(@RoyalsBlue_com)
FIRE GMDM. FIRE YOST. CHANGE THE HITTING COACH.

Wait... They're 7-1? You mean that there's no reason to overreact? 

OH.
#YEHYEHYEHYEH
Edinson Volquez was great tonight. I also spelled his name right, so there's that.
Sal still cares.
And they still have three more outs. They could come back.
But, on the flip, they weren't going to lose every single game.
I'm not mad about losing a game. I'm mad about losing to the Twins. THE TWINS, GUYS.
SHORTEN. UP. PIECE OF JUNK.
I mean, it's not like we were gonna go 162-0. But I still think that we might come back.
......................................
I WISH, I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART THAT OMAR INFANTE WOULD HIT A DINGER.
They can do this. THEY CAN GET FOUR GD RUNS.
I do not appreciate being referred to as "Sparky" and in an indirect context.  https://t.co/gNrn6bYsa4
Guys.... Are we gonna lose? We're not gonna lose..... I don't wanna lose.
A Moose bomb would be #neat.
It's okay. I hate me too.  https://t.co/0aPyaIbX5Z
I blame @royalscountry76
#Royals http://t.co/njqNR92NBy
I KNOW IT'S JUST ONE HIT BUT OMG YAY.
GORDON
GORDON
GORDON
GUYS
GORDON
HE HAD AN RBI
GORDON. 
HAPPY.
Not gonna yell. Not gonna yell. Not gonna yell.
Ya know, I met Lorenzo Cain once.
I KNOW WHY WE'RE LOSING. IT'S BECAUSE MY BROTHER IS HERE AND IT'S UPSETTING THE MOJO.
Please score a run. A lot of runs. PLEASE.
They're stranding lots of guys tonight. Very 2012 of them.
HE GOT A HIT
Michael Christopher Moustakas.
:(((((
Welp
I'd shuffle the lineup too if I were beaten by 9 runs.
Oh :(
Shorten up, Hosmer.
I'd love a 3-run jack from Cain. It would be swell.
Can I get a three-run bomb from Cain?
Moooooooose? MOOOOOOOOSE.
The Royals can't hit Kyle Gibson. But remember when they couldn't hit Jon Lester? #ALChamps #ForeverRoyal
Royals.
Question about Gordon for @goldbergkc. When did he find out that he needed wrist surgery in the offseason? And did he get it right away?
Don't like the Cardinals. #DailyThoughtsIn4Words
Yeah. I also remember when they couldn't hit Jon Lester.  https://t.co/OA2oa8YSvX
Ugh. Kyle Gibson. We can't ever hit that guy.
No, it's because I'm #LegallyBlind in one eye.  https://t.co/ltPfcxjt8C
My old art teacher used to call me this.  https://t.co/FdqtBXGWUr
Just when I was about to break an attendance record (one month without missing school) the Royals go and have a day game. THANKS, MLB.
THAT WILL BE THE LAST TEENAGE GIRL TWEET FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I PROMISE.
When your boyfriend breaks up with you over text. That's not nice.

"Hey, Sarah. Is Wade Davis any good?"
-Not really. I wouldn't drop anyone on YOUR fantasy team for him.

*Walks away and laughs*
I find it slightly funny that the school has blocked a website that I write for on the web filter. 

*looks at @KCSportsNation*
If you can possibly hate the Detroit Tigers even more than you already do, you don't hate them enough.
None of which I care about.... Still shoulda brought my headphones.
Is there day baseball on today? Hmmmm.... Didn't know that.
Me: I was very serious about the Cardinals thing. 
Teacher: Okay, Sarah. I'm ignoring you now.
Hi, so I would rather keep Cain in center field. Okay? Okay.
I was on this team once.  https://t.co/yqO6fuWLWG

These Zubaz. I like them. I think they make my butt look bigger than it already is though.
I'm taking the harder science class next year just to try to get into @Mizzou. I hope they're happy.
I mean, I don't like Carrasco, but I feel for the guy. Hope he's okay.
