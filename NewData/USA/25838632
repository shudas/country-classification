#Rangers RHP Anthony Ranaudo is expected to start tomorrow.
#Rangers SP Colby Lewis joins @BenRogers &amp; @SkinWade NEXT on @1053thefan
Yeah... https://t.co/lgu2CumpeZ
#Rangers-#Angels mound matchup tonight: Two guys, Martinez &amp; Rucinski, WON rotation spots as underdogs entering camp. Earned it.
Here's a tribute to the friendship of Adrian Beltre and Elvis Andrus. Pretty funny stuff. http://t.co/ojCicV2F8h #Rangers
Alex Rios out for some time. Former #Rangers  https://t.co/Ewr9gnm4M6
Oh man this is awesome! @JeffWilson_FWST, you look like a giant! https://t.co/TQC3wvpiEZ
Happy Birthday to two good friends I made during my time in Michigan, @mnuechter &amp; @jkatzenstein. Cheers, boys!
Looking forward to it!  https://t.co/TVDEAXVl1I
ICYMI: Here are @BenRogers, @SkinWade, @ktfuntweets, and @Shippyfunsports's 2015 #Rangers songs: http://t.co/D37M4hr7OD
Prince Fielder has reached base in seven straight games #Rangers
My #3Stars for #Rangers-#Angels

No. 3: Stolmy Pimentel
No. 2: @ALaForce's husband (going thru 2-3-4 in 8th)
No. 1: Matt Shoemaker
NEXT on the #Rangers Postgame: Our #3Stars of the game. Who are yours?
#Rangers hitters saw 146 pitches over 35 plate appearances. That's slightly over 4/PA. Much better rate than season average.
Get those calls (877.881.1053) and texts (43733) ready to go. #Rangers Xtra Innings immediately follows our network postgame on @1053thefan
The four-game homerless streak at home for the #Rangers is their longest such streak to begin a season in franchise history.
#Rangers Network Postgame Show begins NOW. Hear from @Bannyrooster28, player rxn, a roundtable wrap, #3stars and more.
Random #Rangers Stat

On PAs of 3 or less pitches: 5/15 and a sac fly

On PAs of 4+ pitches: 2/19 w/ a BB
Texas-Ex Huston Street on to close out the game for the #Angels. #Rangers handed him his first Angels BS last year.
That's a heckuva job by Pimentel. Eating innings for a tired bullpen...ALMOST finished the gig. #Rangers
I'd put a ton of money that they finish the year hitting over .200 when ABs reach a 2-0 count.  https://t.co/TgRlCfyHmN
You can research since I know your angle. Was just pointing out multi-hit efforts. Not proclaiming him king. https://t.co/qsfNG50N3i
Gotta think the #Rangers are facing some bad luck right now. They aren't going to go all year hitting sub-.200 when they get 2-0 count
That's 5 multi-hit games for @RealPFielder28 to start the season. #Rangers
Within the last week on waivers from the #Pirates. A guy @Bannyrooster28 was familiar with from his time there. https://t.co/kTmK3K0JwX
The #Rangers will send Choo-Beltre-Fielder to the plate this inning. They'll face @ALaForce's husband (Joe Smith).
Yeah, it is mid-April. Again, like so many things this early, something worth following. https://t.co/LeW0ThbyD4
Haha! https://t.co/CED03tZIbu https://t.co/iM5WnGecsC
You want a bedtime story? Jk. Used to be a prized prospect w/ Mariners. Couldn't hit CVs. Great tools. https://t.co/ug7neFvX72
Just the way baseball can be weird. Odor's had a 9-pitch AB: K, a 3-pitch AB: 1B, and a 8-pitch AB: backwards K. #Rangers
He has one hit so far.  https://t.co/YM2OxtVdzR
After network programming, we've got #Rangers Xtra Innings. @inthemageors, @OThankKevin, &amp; me invite you to join 877.881.1053 @1053thefan
130 of those with the #Rangers in the regular season. He also hit 14 in the postseason with Texas.  https://t.co/Y1vLa3H0ZM
For those wondering, Stolmy was not named after anyone in particular. It was a name his mom, "invented." #Rangers
"Pimentel knows how to endear himself to #Rangers fans" - @nadeler...well said.
Something to follow. He's got to be better 2nd/3rd time thru but it has been just 2 starts. https://t.co/EcRMPFBER8
It's early. Yesterday he reached base 2x in 3 plate appearances https://t.co/1CFFKeDbmF
Just adding to this. Entering year in career, .233 OBA first time thru, .312 OBA 2nd + time thru #Rangers  https://t.co/KPvh8vEnVL
Martin sees eight pitches before striking out. He's seen 15 in 3 PAs. Much improved. #Rangers
Got it. July, most likely.  https://t.co/gAWK9WtOih
At the end the week is when they could call him up w/o loss of control. #Rangers  https://t.co/PoFlekRtUo
Tomorrow, when it is his turn in the rotation to start again. Are you confusing him with someone else? @nmather21  https://t.co/uABEUeWNQK
Honestly, when that guy does something well I just--no...no...it isn't worth it.
Two times thru the order, Detwiler (groundball specialist) got just 2 groundouts. First batter, third time thru, HRs to LCF. Tie game.
I can double check, but I think 3 (set yesterday) is the record since moving to the current venue  https://t.co/41V34gt31H
He can certainly play his way into a tough decision for @Bannyrooster28 and co.  https://t.co/2LxieUHrNR
