Truly inspiring times. The support for @theSNP  is humbling.Its solid! And so wide based.
Why is @UKLabour prepared to let a warmonger who lied to Parliament contribute to current debate? Do you learn nothing?

Curiously, I can't help thinking that @JimForScotland comments tonight did not go past London. He speaks for no one but himself
Any one wiser than I care to comment on this after tonight's debate?  https://t.co/3HMOxIl0fV
For me,the last 2 debates have been conclusive.@JimForScotland is no leader. Lab position is weaker than ever. Good to have @scotgp tonite
Did @JimForScotland clear it with his boss in London before commenting on ending austerity? Ed Balls talks a different language
There I am going to say it, @BBCJamesCook did an honest job of holding it all together on #leadersdebate I would not gripe about bias
Out tonight supporting @IanBlackfordSNP in the Black Isle. Colin Watson ready to spring into action! #VoteSNP  #GE15 http://t.co/Pwnf9suu7z
