We all noted that the comedic gold, sex crazed half marathoners story mysteriously disappeared from the news.  @breakfasters
That was brilliant.  Looney Tunes is even fantastic on radio.  More please.  @breakfasters
So watched the Micallef Pogram.  Still made no sense whatsoever.

The end of the @GMegalogenis Making Australia Great series was odd and deeply flawed.  @theage http://t.co/w3iLV2KA8M
Clive should complain to the ACCC that the votes he bought have not met expectations.  In fact they hit an iceberg and sunk. @breakfasters
The parents of @declanf had a thing for WW II PT boat captains.  @aliciasometimes journalists turned pollies perhaps? #McKew @breakfasters
Solid argument from @JasonDowling1 in @theage 
http://t.co/AHEYF3oCjN
Not good.

Yes,  visual humour on the radio always works a treat!  @breakfasters #PuddlesEatsAPie

The man ( @Podolski10 ) can't score in Italy, but against Australia is on for seconds and it's Whack a Mole time!  #GERAUS @Arsenal
I love @Podolski10 but that hurt!!  @Arsenal #GERAUS 2-2

Good morning, is Bling Matthews 3rd at Milan San Remo newsworthy?  @declanf
Fos, I love your work, but that goal by Ki-Ji Lee was from an obtuse angle, not an acute one.  @sbsnews  @Craig_Foster #Jets

Somebody with my name just asked me to Connect with them on  Linked In.  That's just weird.  And disturbing.
And I reckon both the Giroud goal and the Ramsey one are shoe ins for Cracker Night.  @SantoSamEd #SSETotalFootball # Arsenal
