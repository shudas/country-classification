I finally watched that video of Amy Schumer on Ellen that's been making its rounds on Facebook. Despite everyone's claims of its hilarity
Lord. Husband snores so fucking loud. I cannot sleep. So I decided I'm going to start roaring like a dinosaur.He snores; I roar.Fair, right?
I'm so stressed. Things feel overwhelming which makes me just want to curl up and cry. I don't have the means to change my circumstance rn 😭
Fried plantain gives me life 🙌🏽
Living this right now. Trying to decide what to give up so I can register with a professional association for work.  https://t.co/u4US2qLq7D
WM just told me that I'm not an expert on racism and only think I am because I married a Black man. 😂 And white ppl are the most oppressed
I unfollowed an activist the other day who was carrying on about how we need to be nicer to white people to really change racism. Nope.
Now some Christian is trying to challenge my Nontheism. 😒 This is not that day for it. I leave you alone in your beliefs. Leave me to mine
Gawd. White ignorance is exasperating.Even if I DID hate WP (don't worry, it's #NotAllWhitePeople that I disdain)THAT IS NOT RACISM.LEARN IT
As uncomfortable as so many people are with fatness, they're even more uncomfortable with women who are fat and comfortable in their bodies
Whoa. Researching Mi'qmaw traditions around pregnancy and the # of studies done by white experts that reference Mi'qmaw women as some kind
Husband makes me mad. We fight it out with emojis. Signs of a mature, healthy relationship.
Every time someone accidentally types me instead of my I automatically read whatever they've said in a pirate voice. 😆
People who exist on the Internet solely for the purpose of trolling are pathetic.
I'll bet you think this song is about you... Because you're a privileged white male and you think everything is about you.
Uh, do you even science, Dove?

What the shit?! I thought AllLivesMatter was bad.But white people out there hashtagging PoliceLivesMatter.The ignorance. Profound and wilful
Sometimes I think WP are just competing for who can be the shittiest racist twit re: racist promprosals.
Some BM have internalized their opression so deeply. My husband's cousin dates a WW who made a joke about photographing him picking cotton
👀 Take note. I can share knowledge I've acquired but you're gonna pay me for it.  https://t.co/6mucO3gsxM
The college that won't renew my contract because I wouldn't be a good little compliant woman is advertising for the position of psych prof
How the shit did I just read that teacher admitted to having consensual sex with her 16yo student? There can be no consent. That's rape.
Jesusfuckingchrist. The next time a Black person says #BlackLivesMatter and some dumbshit white person jumps in with No, all lives matter😡😡😡
90% of the time I come across as a caustic asshole and I'm perfectly okay with that.
My kitty is so cute. She did a little exploring outside yesterday. I think she was mad that I captured her. 😝 http://t.co/zjmkqYGIfk
It's not cute when you call me Pocahontas. I am #NotYourPocahontas
And now I'm signing off social media the rest of the day bc my heart hurts. I leave this cuteness to lighten the mood http://t.co/gXBpxsiO62
Cops have learned the best ways to murder Black ppl while avoiding culpability. Honestly, I believe that white man wanted to kill this man
Being entitled to an opinion and having an opinion worthy of expressing are two different things. Learn that.
The first white person to speak of #EricHarris as a felon and not a human being deserving of BREATH is going to call upon my violent side.
I can't even sleep now. Even without that video I have a mental image in my mind and I'm afraid of the nightmares that will come to me.
How tragic is it that I see a name as a hashtag and I KNOW that's another dead Black person?! #EricHarris

Every time there's a conference on aboriginal issues at the uni it's led by some white expert. 😒  https://t.co/PHyV4m2qXb

And you know the only reason anything might come of this is because white people are protecting their "assets" https://t.co/MhSWyCpZT5
Imagine if we just en masse stopped participating in capitalism. Imagine.
I know I'm not going to get a job from Twitter, but most days I find the exchange of ideas on here more valuable than my $30,000+ degree
It is warm and sunny and springlike. My daughter is off playing with a neighbour kid making up a dance routine. Bliss.
When you swear so much you're not sure if you cursed in an interview or not. :/
Bae playing with my hair and I'm just like http://t.co/spqDDkenja
#NationalSiblingsDay is a reminder that my only biological sibling is an asshole whom I haven't spoken to in about 6 years.
That video of that white dude talking about white supremacy getting accolades... PoC been saying that shit for years. Where's our accolades?
Watched some of Obama's appearance at UWI and even as a Black president, he totally has white saviour complex.

I cannot understand compassionless people. How can you not have empathy for fellow beings? I have so much empathy it hurts sometimes.
