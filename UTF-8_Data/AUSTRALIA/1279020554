Disappointed in australia big brother fans, how did we evict Leo?? #BBAU
Interesting #qanda tonight..all need to be happy we have the opportunity to be heard so many other countries do not share the same freedom
It's a human problem, however, it's we are being heard otherwise senator would not have turned up. What a wonderful country we all live in
Journalist... We are now discriminating them!! Make up your mind Australia. #tonyseriously #qanda
#QandA really!! The laws keep us safe in Australia. I wonder how those in areas of conflict are feeling about us whinging on our SOFT lounge
Wallabies deserved that!! So proud @QantasWallabies http://t.co/By7lpabYba

#qanda @QandA We are too busy being bullies including the public, not listening to the value of any legislation on either side#laborliberal

It should be all about the force and the fans the badger is drawing but in true Aus. rugby fashion it's all about the Tahs. @FOXRugbyLive
