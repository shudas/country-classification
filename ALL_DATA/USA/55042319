One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile🎶
S/O to @taylorlynndrake for waking me up for class! You the real MVP🙌
I have my headphones in, music playing loudly of course, and I can still hear tdrake laughing upstairs to herself... 😅
I wish I could come pick you up, take you out.
