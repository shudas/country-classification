It was so nice having chummy time today, just with my chummy😊❤️
Aw, just met the loveliest american  boys in the chippy, they were so nice and funny😊❤️
Going for Kayley&amp;Becca Time☺️ Missed my chummy❤️
Honest to god, I always skip meals, without intending to😑
The times I eat at are so fucked up. My first meal of the day is going to be dinner😫
I'm not even going to get 45 minutes sleep
9:02am - Kayley hasn't slept at all and she is 99.9% sure she is dying.😑
I feel so effing awful😖
Honestly keep thinking I'm slipping in and out of consciousness and it's freaking me out😖
I have to be up in an hour and 25 minutes as well. Good one Kayley.
I should really sleep, but I just can't and it's hell😫
Just took an IQ test..now I understand why all my friends say I'm the clever one.😅 unless any of them can get their IQ higher than 155/175😅
It's 8am, I've had no sleep, so instead of sleeping,inspired by the lovely @JimsTweetings 's new video, I'm taking an IQ test.
“You could be the smartest person in the world, but if you're a dickhead, you won't go very far”~@JimsTweetings This is why I love you Jim❤️
Why am I listening to Arabic music? I understand literally nothing and isn't putting to me asleep😅 ffs.

Am I actually tired before 7am tonight?😅
I actually love my cousins approach to life. After reading her new blog post, I now realise what people mean when they say I'm her double😅
All my friends think I'm the 'boring friend' but if you were to go on all the adventures I think about, your opinion would be different🌌

Having insomnia actually sucks. I want to sleep, but y'know, I just can't and it's just exhausting.😴
