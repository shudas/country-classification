Can't believe I done a really addictive drug, I'm more mature than my past self.
Happier, active, and productive.
Weed is where it's at yo!

Couples trip together, and they stay together.

She's so pretty that she's out of my league totally..
Me:it's a feeling that only comes from a person that can give'r.
Guy: you were paying for sex.
My friend:well I bought the sex.
Good times;)
My demons only come out at night.
Why does it feel so good.

More cheers more beers
Hard to find a girl that will take interest in me.
Not so many I take interest in to.
And I fucked up most of mine with excessive drug use.
My pain is self chosen..
Buy 20 grams for myself.
Try one or two grams in the theaters with some chicks.
Trip out, drink, and enjoy my time with them :)
Well my search for a girlfriend starts, haven't had one for 5 years.
Been grieving for love but I'll soon find someone worth my time
Ezra you'll be fine temporary
Atm in the lounge jamming out. http://t.co/Rqaq2PqEo3
The Animals - Baby, let me take you home
The Beatles - Hey Jude
Nothing much I can do today.
He's gone, I'm left here sobbing under the blankets, easily my demons can bother me..
IDK what love feels like anymore.
I know what addiction to violence feels but I know for sure it's been years since I had a woman in my arms
