I now understand why I had to accidentally finish my last paper two days early. Clearly I was racking up the karma for this one.
Fell asleep by accident and didn't finish my paper in time for class but the professor just informed us we have until 4:30 to turn it in...
I give up. I'm spending the rest of the day outside.
This is probably the earliest I have had an assignment done since elementary school.
I just flattened myself writing this entire 8pg research paper today and ran into class with it and it. wasn't. due. until. Wednesday.
