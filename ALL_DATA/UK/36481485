#StarWarsTheForceAwakens new trailer = six to midnight!!!
Glad I ended up going to see #GoodKill because it was very good indeed! Pretty depressing subject matter but still very good! Solid 8/10!
Days like today remind me why I need to find myself a new job!! This place is full of absolute cretins!!
Cinema double bill tomorrow night will consist of #WhileWereYoung followed by #GoodKill with @Stark_Bitch
England had a batting collapse?! What a shocking revelation!!! #ENGvsWI
Wanted a £5 note out the cash machine and it only has £20 notes!! It's going to be one of those days!!
Operating on just over 3 hours sleep, so I don't need a junkie smacked off his tits walking out in front of my car at 8.25am! #scumbag
Exclusive preview screening of #GameOfThrones Season 5, you have read that correctly! Thanks for the invite @ristarch http://t.co/19RMqZ5Z1m
Supporting spurs really is depressing hard work!!
That's me finally done with football and betting!! They can both go and fuck themselves!!!
Good god Sherwood is going to be unbearable!!! COME ON TOTTENHAM!!!
I didn't like him anyway but now that clown Sherwood comes out and says that @hkane28 wouldn't get in the Villa team!! What a prize twat!
Whoo hoo @Stark_Bitch is back from her little trip down south!! No more cooking for me anytime soon!! #result
Enjoying #Daredevil so far!! Another reason  to get yourself @NetflixUK if you don't have it already! I don't even pay for mine! @Kerrh22
I'm missing my weekly @wittertainment podcast!! Hurry back please chaps!!
Also just seen the trailer for #Sinister2 which is not a film I was expecting to get a sequel! Hope it's good as I rather liked the first!
#GuillermodelToro remaking Disney's #HauntedMansion is very odd for so many reasons!! Don't really know what else to say.
So I'm even more excited for #TrueDetectiveSeason2 after seeing that teaser trailer!!
Do not feel well.
Being stuck at work when the weather is like this, is very depressing. A beer in a beer garden would be much better!!
So @taylorswift13 and @CalvinHarris I can see, two very good looking people but @taylorswift13 and @seanstledger12 that's just frustrating!
I do not enjoy missing my bus!
WTF Facebook!!! Why won't you bloody work!!!
To all the people that bother following me on Twitter, I urge you to go and see #JohnWick at the cinema! You'll not be disappointed!
#JohnWick was bloody fantastic fun!!!
Wow, Man City really are crap at the moment!! Me thinks they will have a new manager next season!!
1 WEEK TODAY!!!!!!!!!!! #GameOfThrones
Well that was awful. #BURTOT
Summer clearout is very much needed!!! #Spurs
#FastAndFurious7 is going down as my 2nd favourite of the series so far! Fast 5 is still my favourite! Still though, a high 8/10!!
I may or may not have cried. #FastAndFurious7
#FastAndFurious7 in a word.....Awesome! However the ending was very very sad. A fitting tribute to #PaulWalker though. #RIPPaulWalker
Bought my first two #StudioGhibli films today on Blu Ray! I plan on collecting them all I reckon!!
Gym done! Now something healthy for dinner!! Need to start getting into this routine more often!!
Booked into the 5pm #Imax showing of #FastAndFurious7 tomorrow! Very excited so I am!!
Shame #SeventhSon wasn't particularly good though!! My #AliciaVikander deserves better than that!!! 4/10!!
I've changed my mind, #AliciaVikander is my new favourite!! #beautiful
So #Southpaw looks like it could be pretty good!!
Two weeks today!!! #GameOfThrones
Good stuff from @RondaRousey on #WrestleMania tonight!! #sohot
On the plus side I very much enjoyed #Cinderella That would get a 7/10!! #StrevensSeven
I knew #GetHard wouldn't be very good but yet it still managed to disappoint me!! 4/10!
Tonight my eyes shall be watching #Cinderella followed shortly afterwards by #SeventhSon
Very much enjoying the @KermodeMovie &amp; @simonmayo @bbc5live podcast. Might not agree with all of Mark's reviews but well worth a listen!
Off to see @nickmulveymusic tonight in Glasgow! @Stark_Bitch is rather excited!!
"@EUROSP0RF: Roy Hodgson has already been putting the England Squad through some energising  routines

In other news, I'm starting to think @Stark_Bitch has a gin problem!! Put the bottle down love!!!
Another game of 7's, another defeat!! Why do I even bother?!!
As much as I don't like saying it, congratulations to Hearts. They deserved to win the league and get promoted.
#Home tomorrow and #Chappie on Wednesday! That's the cinema plans so far for the week ahead!!
#Hibs were very disappointing today. Not enough urgency and not good enough going forward! Will need to be a lot better to win the play-off!
Very excited for some #ElClaciso action!! #HalaMadrid
So the first season of #MurderInTheFirst was very enjoyable, excited for season 2!!
Need to adapt to who we are playing as well. We play the same formation regardless every week!! #Spurs
Plus as much as I like Mason and Nabil, we need a strong defensive midfield player to play every week, while we rotate the other two! #Spurs
We can't defend for toffee!! Poch needs a centre back as a priority in the summer! Walker isn't great either for that matter! #Spurs
Bloody knew I should have made Kane Captain!! Was going to do it as well but changed my mind at the last minute!!! #noluck #FantasyFootball
Only 84 days until Croatia!! 12 weeks tomorrow as it happens!! Very excited!!
Heading to @BMBEdinburgh for the first time today! Been hearing good things!! @Stark_Bitch
#TheVoices was very bloody odd indeed but I did enjoy it and found it funny, so 6/10 from me. Left it at 3 yesterday, too tired for the 4th!
#WildCard was very enjoyable. Not a typical all out action film from Jason Statham but enjoyable all the same. 2 down 2 to go. #filmday
1 down 3 to go I should have said! 5 films in one day probably is a tad too much! #filmday
#TheGunman was decent. Nothing I haven't seen countless times before though. 5/10. 1 down 4 to go! #filmday
Just over an hour until the quadruple bill gets under way!! @Stark_Bitch
Looking forward to seeing both of these on Friday! #Home #TheVoices #cineworld #cinema #dreamworks… https://t.co/UOV9l9ZlQJ
A picture of @stark_bitch before she went for her first run in over a year!! She might have only… https://t.co/ywCTzWSQxS
Looks like spring is finally upon us bitch!!
#Pixels - Teaser Trailer: http://t.co/FOYDnc0Gbh  
This could be very amusing!!
So #RunAllNight was the perfect example of a Strevens 7!!
The amount of knobs that go out on #StPatricksDay is really quite ridiculous!!
Is Snapchat still a thing? Do people still even use it?!
Very very excited to see #JohnWick
Happy #StPaddysDay to all you spud munchers out there!!
I don't care what people say, I thought #ItFollows was bloody superb!! Really really liked it! Solid 9/10!!
Myself and @Stark_Bitch will attempt to do a quadruple bill at @CineworldEdin this Friday, with a Chinese buffet thrown in for good measure!
X + Y was very good! 7/10 from me!
Nearly two weeks since I was last at the cinema = not good enough!!
#NigelPearson really is a gigantic twat!!!
#Fortitude is awesome! Really bloody odd but still awesome!!
Nice one Tottenham, nice one!! #Pathetic
Will be pretty disappointed if we don't get at least a point today!! Probably jinxed it now I've said that!! #COYS #Spurs #Tottenham #THFC
Finally going to see #ItFollows on Monday night! This will be my 4th attempt at trying to see it!!
