Why do I have the song Young At Heart stuck in my head? 😞
Why am I getting invited to groups about shows I've never watched??? I can't even find the option button to leave it either. 😞
My roots are coming through, but here have a selfie. http://t.co/q13flLy0W6
Ootd. 😊👌 http://t.co/3dRe8z6bmN
Just realised I haven't been on my fandom Tumblr for ages. 😲
Good luck to one of my favourite girlies who has got an interview today. You'll be amazing! 💕😘 @XBrogiebearX
Everything would be better if my depression would stop kicking my ass, but I always manage to get back up ten times stronger.
I finished Gotham about two months ago, but its still being shown on 5*. 😂
This woman became famous from a video of a snake biting her nipple. It gets worse.
Her boob job became infected, yet she still used sunbeds. You silly cow.
Now there's a girl on here who wants to look like Pamela Anderson. Why. 😞
I only have two tattoos and they're both on my arm, but I can't stand it when people stare at them. It's so bloody rude.
I would rather grow old gracefully than prolong it with surgery.
Why would you stop yourself from getting older with surgery? 😞 It's so unnatural.
Hunting and fox hunting sickens me in general, but seeing that vile woman lying next to the giraffe with a big grin on her face sickens me.
It sickens me how hunters can call themselves human beings, after shooting an innocent animal and proudly showing off their "trophy" online.
This goes out to the girl that charmingly called me a "slut." 👌 #feminism http://t.co/WXxNJEqOYL
I am so sore and itchy. 😞
Please tell me I'm not the only person who gets prickly heat on their feet? 😞
I am in love. 😍😍😍 #reeses #peanutbuttercups #reesespeanutbuttercups #foodporn #Americancandy #vsocam https://t.co/YJ6V0u3cRe
Ffs all I wanna do is change my name
HM Revenue &amp; Customs are terrible to get a hold of. 😞
Look at my little bubba when he was an 8 week old puppy. 😍🐶🐾 #englishspringerspaniel… https://t.co/RQtBtcd563
Johnny Knoxville from Jackass and Bad Grandpa is literally the light of my life. Legend. 😂😂
Are you ever going to make a Snapchat app for Windows Phones? I'm sick of using my crappy iPod for Snapchat. @Snapchat
MY STEPDAD BOUGHT ME 50 GRAMS OF TOBACCO. I AM SO HAPPY
You know somebody doesn't really give a shit about you, when they tell you to "Think positive" during a depressive spell. Oh wow. Thanks.
Nobody can take off my mask.
I can have like the biggest smile on my face and be laughing, but that doesn't mean I'm not depressed.
Herrick u cunt.
HOW DARE YOU STAB MY NINA!!!
George and Nina fighting makes me sad.
Never forget Doug from Skins was in Being Human as a police officer. 😂
A bitch, so be it.
I liked Mitchell but he was a complete arsehole in series 3 of Being Human, so you can see why Nina stood up to him and if that makes her
After series 3 of Being Human I like to imagine George, Nina and baby Eve all living together happily.
Though The Heavens Fall and The Longest Day still remains as my two favourite Being Human episodes.
Woke up with these marks on me this morning. Wtf. http://t.co/jTpuYty9cJ
Tyran is being so good today that I keep forgetting he's here. 😊
I have fond memories of singing Rude with Vic at the top of our lungs in Bristol. 🎶😜 @VictoriaGreen_x
My name is so long that it barely fits on my debit card. 😂😂
Whenever I'm sad I remember that time I nearly walked into a staff room, when I was looking for R. 😂😂 @VictoriaGreen_x
I've got really bad indigestion. 😞
Literally don't know why I bother most of the time. ☹
The lady who I opened the door to was very surprised by my enthusiasm and how I told her straight out… https://t.co/8AuIzsBAF1
I want another dog. 😞
I really want a Springer puppy. 😞 My mum won't let me though. 😂
At least when I get married, I've got it all planned out. 😂
Literally I want loads of fairy lights and cute center pieces at my reception. I also want my mama walking me down the aisle.
I wanna get married in a converted barn and then I want a marquee in a field with The Wurzels or a tribute act there.
I would love to wear a 1950s style wedding dress if I ever get married. 😍
Watching Don't Tell The Bride. 👰😊
Poor Ant and the Yorkshire terrier going for him. 😂😂 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent
Watching The Grand National! Come on Across The Bay!
Look at what's on tonight! Xx @THEKERRYHOWARD http://t.co/Z3yNRe7eWs
Scott took this photo of him &amp; Woody and my dog is such a cutie pie. I love him so much. 🐶 ❤ http://t.co/sInweYIch3
Everytime I stroke my dogs chin and make kissy sounds to him, he kisses me on the face. My boy is so cute. 🐶
Me and my mum used to say "Oh not James Pond again", when I was little and it was on the telly. 😂
I don't understand the appeal of it all.
I feel like I'm the only British person who hates James Bond. 😞
"Well you're no good as prime minster, you fat faced Tory." 😂😂😂 #Gogglebox
"Where is the River Thames?" I don't live in London, but even I know where it is. 😂 #Gogglebox
"I'm the only gay in the village." 😂😂😂 #Gogglebox
Gogglebox is drastically cheering me up. 😊👌
I spent my high school careerSpit on and shoved to agreeSo I could watch all my heroesSell a car on TV. ~
It was a lie when they smiledAnd said, "You won't feel a thing." ~
And if you think that I'm wrongThis never meant nothing to you. ~
You're just a sad song with nothing to sayAbout a life long wait for a hospital stay. ~
I'm still breathingBut we've been dead for a whileThis sickness has no cure, we're going down for sure. ~
Maybe I was too pale, maybe I was too fatMaybe you had better, better luck in the sack. ~
Oh I can finally see myself againI know I am enoughPossible to be lovedIt was not about me. ~
By the grace of GodI picked myself back upI put one foot in front of the otherAnd I looked in the mirror and decided to stay. ~
We were living on a foul lineAnd I felt the fault was all mine.~
Thought I wasn't enough Found I wasn't so tough Laying on the bathroom floor. ~
I can see the writing on the wall, I can't ignore this war At the eh-end of it all Who am I living for? ~
Jenna Mourey/Marbles always cheers me up. 😊 She is my spirit animal.
There's a million reasons why I should give you up But the heart wants what it wants The heart wants what it wants. ~
This is a modern fairy tale No happy endings No wind in our sails But I can't imagine a life without Breathless moments. ~
Arrogant girl'Cause a scene like you're supposed toThey'll fall asleep without youYou're lucky if your memory remains. ~
Give me therapy, I'm a walking travestyBut I'm smiling at everythingTherapy, you were never a friend to me. ~
Therapy By ATL just came on at the right time and now I'm crying.
Even though it's over now, it still kills inside'Cause for so long you have been my life. ~
It feels just like I'm going crazyI guess that this is breaking up And now not even you can save me Will someone wake me up? ~
I wish we could go backAnd remember what we were fighting forWish you knew thatI miss you too much to be mad anymore. ~
We were a crooked loveIn a straight line downMakes you wanna run and hideBut it makes you turn right back around. ~
'Cause I can't turn to you when it all falls apart, no, oh. ~
Everything is going to shit tonight. 😩
MY CORONATION STREET OTP BROKE UP. FFS MY FEELS.
I feel really down and horrible tonight.
My brother is usually really good at vacuuming, but somehow I've managed to cut my foot open with a shard of glass. Ouch. 😭
One day I want somebody to love me, as much as I love them.
Why the fuck do I put myself through this same old crap everyday?
Having a picnic in Victoria Park with the brother and my nephew. 😊 #mylegs #royalvictoriapark #bath… https://t.co/xFmknw8AUK
Off to Victoria Park in Bath!
I made a really amazing edit of George Sands a while ago and I thought Russell should see it. X @russelltovey http://t.co/PbdwZbaLNY
Going for a picnic today with little man and the brother. 😊
"I think there's a poison in you which has nothing to do with being a vampire, so yeah, I think you do enjoy it."GO NINA.
Can I have a George Sands please?
GTA V is literally my favourite game to play and I never get tired of it.
Painting my toenails purple. 😊
HERRICK COMING BACK STILL SHOCKS ME, EVEN THOUGH I'VE SEEN THIS EPISODE A MILLION TIMES.
Robson Green as McNair in Being Human is probably my favourite role of his.
Strong coffee is the way forward. 🍵👌
Somerset looks even more gorgeous in the sun. 😍
The hot weather and sun makes me appreciate where I live even more.
"Aren't you short?" Nina is just about to bite her head off until George steps in. 😂
"Do you think she'll carry on rotting until she's all soupy?"Oh George. 😂

The weather is so much better and hotter down South. #proudsoutherner
Co-Op cheese and onion pasties are the bomb. 💣👌

The worst thing I ever did was get engaged to somebody I wasn't madly in love with.
Just seen Demi advertising Sketchers on my telly. Bae. 😍😍
Roleplaying Nina again makes me happy.
"You're like a piece of deadly furniture." 😂😂😂
I feel so sorry for Faye in Corrie.
I hate the expression "Cheeky pint/Nandos." What's so fucking cheeky about it?!
It is so beautiful outside! I could wake up to this everyday.
Getting indirected by people and being like "wtf."
I wish I had a better phone camera sometimes, because the sight of this red moon is amazing. 😍 🌑… https://t.co/N94XZiZ4HB
I don't know if the Xbox 360 is glitching or Grand Theft Auto IV is. 😞
I'm already having a chocolate hangover. Help.
My mum is so chuffed about my name change that she wrote "Miss Dunster" on my Easter card. She's so cute. 🙊
