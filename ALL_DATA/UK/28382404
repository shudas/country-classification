I'm trying so hard to be happy but it's just not working.
Love how much shit I get for not drinking. Fuck off.
Going to have to get under the car again tomorrow. More work to be done. Sick.
My "I'm feeling shit and still have hopes of feeling better" jam http://t.co/wn114zUJPD
Feel so shitty. Everything sucks.
"Tell me why you're scared?" I wish I fucking knew
Let me be the last thing you forget
Really don't appreciate this whole glamorisation of drug use lately
Someone with a limited edition corsa said my car was shit.... I'll respect your opinion when you have a real car. Cunt.
The fact that someone would care and you don't would be something to be proud of really
Being told you're too opinionated should be a compliment
Besides the fact it's very rare that I bet anyway
Just because I work for a betting company dosnt mean I have insider tips. I know as much as you
"I clean my car all the time" sure you do dad. Iron out dosnt lie.. http://t.co/0K9Uu6nwNb
Tropical outside today! Can't wait to finish work!!!!!
Really tired work is killing me off
The windows at work are tinted so I can't tell if it's sunny or not
I've been at my new job since January and I've been promoted. So good to not be in a dead end job anymore
Shorts were a terrible idea
People need to stop with the fast 7 spoilers

So many iPhone photographers thinking they've got "the shot" of the eclipse fuck off.
I slept through the eclipse so I wasn't tired for work. I'm dedicated
But it's gonna drink fuel so much when it's done üò´ the struggle!
Having a cool car is so expensive but way worth it. Fast and practical &amp; low n' slow.
But now I need to decide if I want to run twin weber carbs or bike carbs. Twin weber is way less common but more complicated to do.....
For top notch I'm looking ¬£4100 for okay ¬£3600.

I'm super worn out
Looked alright http://t.co/DMmJ0jfz7c
Someone care to explain why there is baited drum lines and shark nets in the Great Barrier Reef? Isn't that supposed to be protected?
Kills me how touch screen technology 10 years ago was some advanced shit now it's mundane as hell!

Why does being a grown up have to be so hard
Hydraulic suspension...... Haven't seen that in a polo yet

A lot of my friends still can't get over it
The whole people being stunned when you tell them you don't drink is wearing thin now. Just accept it.

But I wouldn't have it any other way
"Yeah my cars finished being modified now" bullshit! Never finished just constant changes and too much money!
Alexisonfire have posted a thing with a date, what does this mean....
You're smoking and call me out on drinking an energy drink cause they're unhealthy. Just jump off a bridge
Reason 6537904 why my brother is amazing: he just sent me shed loads of beard oil, beard soap, balm, moustache wax and a new bears comb
Isn't it time that everyone grew up, realised everyone is equal. People's decisions and lifestyle are not decided by race.
How have we as a society not moved forward, how is there still racist political parties, people that shame other races?
I still can't understand how people are still racist, like young people... People that should know better.
And my mates an apprentice tattooist so he just likes to put random shit on me
Got this lined today because millhouse is cooler than me http://t.co/YS2f64dqtO

I just saw something about a company funded by Santander destroying the rainforest. If this true then fuck Santander.
Everyone is having kids what the fuck is this
Waiting for gta to load is what I imagine dying feels like
Just what I want, screaming children and shouting parents whilst I eat
I hate missing People
I really loved that 180second long snapchat story of you getting "white girl wasted" fucking wow.
Too warm at work I think I'm melting
Followed a peach a mk1 golf on the way to work this morning.
I've had moose blood stuck in my head all day damn their catchy songs
Someone save me from work today

Why would I get a girlfriend when I can build a drift/daily Volvo....
It's a shame. True love don't know my name.
I just don't like it and you know those hangovers you hate. I don't see a point in that
Oh you don't drink? Why?
I might have a candle lit wank or something
Clean polos http://t.co/60caezVZ5J
I've never had a girlfriend so excuse me for not understanding the hype around Valentine's Day
Okay.... I've just finished the final series of futurama... Need more things to watch
Ah you got engaged on Valentine's Day? You fucking cliche
I have an opinion you didn't like? That's great. How about you get back to your life of getting pissed and snorting mkat and fuck off
Shit band vocalists a creep
Oh hey heart in hand broke up.... And I'm over it.
Booty is life

What the fuck is a menist? Men aren't fighting for equal rights why don't you invest your time supporting those that are
For the first time ever my bands putting loads of thought into what we're doing and why we're doing it this is new
If you haven't tried smart water try that shit. It's pure. So pure I can't even think of a witty analogy
Says the guy that's never had a girlfriend though.
I'm sorry but if your relationship can be affected by your snapchat best friends then it's clearly not that stable and you should let go
Anyone else hate neck deep?
It is pretty hard to be positive all the time
Sometimes talking about your problems is the best way to solve them or at least feel better about them.
That last post was a lie I don't even have a cat
"Valentine's Day is coming up, you got plans" "yeah man romantic date with my cat"
