Ive been friends with this Swedish girl in my dorm for two days now, I can't remember her name and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
Basically I think I'm hilarious
I deeply enjoyed my late April fools, as if I'm dumb enough to get a fucking hashtag on my foot #dontanswerthatactually

Reaaaaally wish I was back home
Waiting for the bus on one foot is not the one #tatprobs
The most unrealistic thing in GoT isn't the dragons or the white walkers, its how every woman has fucking perfect hair after sex.
Also has the general public forgotten what country it lives in?! 9/10 of these cinemas will be showing rain.

Cairns can you stop fucking raining m8
Genuinely on the choppiest boat ride of my life 👎😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷🚢
My hostel in Japan has a Sauna. My hostel in Cairns has a fan that is likely to kill me in my sleep

Its been so long since I have watched game of thrones half the cast need to be wearing a fucking name tag
Watching Jamie Lannister in GoT turns me into some kind of teenage girl because he is so handsome I can't even tweet properly
Ah yeah love having $27 to last a week
Everyone's posting pictures of amazing healthy food and I'm like yeah I can't Instagram my fifth consecutive bowl of instant noodles

Hate to be that guy, but this is the best time
If you haven't already guessed, it amazing here.
I don't usually bitch about this sort of thing but the German couple writing their travel diary together on the same sunbed is too much.
I often feel Snapchat live should just have a generic name of white people having fun
Shout out to globalisation once again for providing me with KFC in the middle of the desert

Make bed, wonder what strange lump is, disregard lump, fling self on bed, crush sunglasses and new foundation, wonder why I'm so dumb
If anyone would like to make a charitable donation to my bank account this fine Tuesday, please be my guest
When 22 degrees at night requires trousers and a hoodie you know you've been in Australia too long
To the girl with fake nails, who is generously applying lip gloss in the gym, do these things make you run faster?

RT if you're an alumni who'd probably give a limb to be at varsity right now
Can safely go back to sleep after waking up at 3.30am to find out Varsity Scores, big up @ULLHC massive on another win
Update: netball was shit. As expected.
And finally I'm playing netball on hockey varsity day, I'm disgusted in myself
First varsity in four years that I'm not there, safe to say I'd pay a lot of dollar to be there reminding the DUM that they're shit

If someone could save me from having to go to work but still ensure I get paid that would be amazing thanks
Shoutout to my fat thumb and touchscreen phones for making me look like a knob since 2012
