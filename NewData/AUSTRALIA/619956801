Hey @nicolejensen @kellyyyllek I have my dog max visiting this morning if you'd like to meet him. He's super cute!
Rocky road milkshake!! And Angus' hot chocolate. https://t.co/90Xk7NaB7j
So should not have stopped in the mall tonight. I'm way too broke for that to be a good choice this week!
I so want a super-snuggley zip up vest. I have so much Mum styling coming out in the wash!
I wonder if the new cafe, Beartown, across from the Gabba is referencing the Brisbane Bears? Or if bears are just cool. @brisbanelions
