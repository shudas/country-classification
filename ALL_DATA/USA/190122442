They show up for @MadisonMallards games so UW should have the support. It's sad.  https://t.co/W097N2kwRB
Spread it on!! #KCRoyals
I always make fun of Kid for drinking Mic Ultra, but it sure does taste like the golf course. I'm ready for summer.
Well, @emirates only made it as my favorite airline for 7 days. No wifi, screen didn't work, middle seat when I picked a window. Long 14hrs.
Beef bacon sucks, you guys.
Whaaaaaaaaaat?! http://t.co/Drb6tWyvxA
Kart track was legit. Didn't win, but I decided I got first in the heavyweight division. http://t.co/T2VWhWqhIe
Dubai...through a lot of sand. http://t.co/UEJ69gWFjG
Finally made it. My @emirates flight was as nice as a 13 hour flight could possibly be.
"Sorry, @pandora_radio is not available in this country."
I wish it was Rick Perry instead of Ted Cruz.

Yikes Big 12!
To me, it look like a leprechaun to me. All us gotta do is look up in the tree.

I don't want to read the word class about anything that has to do with sports again. One fan base is no more innocent than another ever.
Kansas fans and Cardinals fans are the worst. Get off my Twitter.
I hope the Chiefs can take Lockett late. Watching that guy run is incredible.
Seat belt laws are unconstitutional...but you should wear them for your family.

I use @instagram less than I should 4 #socialbusiness bc of how inconvenient it is to switch 2&amp;from my personal account #ETTNpdp #SMSsummit
I didn't even know Twitter had analytics! That will be useful. #SMSsummit #ETTNpdp
I wish I could follow @KCStar without getting their awful political opinions.
Also if you know that someone was the first one in the gym and last to leave, than actually you were.
There are more people who are "first one in last to leave" than there are gyms. This isn't possible.
Why get mad about Uber surge pricing? They tell you how much it costs and then you choose to, or not to buy it...what's the problem?
Just waiting for jack white tonight. http://t.co/1wr75n11aa
I'm an anti-seat reclining guy. But if you are going to drop your seat back on my knees please don't lean forward for the rest of the flight
Not surprisingly there were a lot of obnoxious kU fans on the plane to Austin. So brutal.
Gotta earn that veto.
I just want you guys to know that I am the reason gas prices are low...not because of improved science in extracting fuel from shale.
I want to work with the GOP as long as it isn't about any of the things they are trying to do, I will veto those as soon as they hit my desk
Someone explain to me how it is currently hard to vote?
Obama just said climate change is a bigger threat to my generation than ISIS.
I'm all about having political opinions, but please do not just regurgitate the political opinions of the @KCStar. Think for yourself.
Shocking, Obama wants to give more people something for nothing...why work 50 weeks when you could work 49! http://t.co/5bSXGZDqpj
Just so you know, it's 78 degrees here in LA right now.
Love it when Aquib Talib sucks or makes mistakes. He deserves it. #cantcatch #cantshoot (guns) #kU
I think it is @DannyParkins fault, but if I hear or read the word narrative one more time tonight, I'm going to lose it.
Pats have the best player on the field. Always a plus.
Only took a couple hours for the XII'ers to forget that the team they wanted to send to the playoff got beat by the 4th best Big10 team.
"This OU game just shows that the ACC is better than the SEC." - @J_bekz, probably
Some pretty sickening and disgusting pass coverage from @ericwinston there. Let me just lay down for a second guys.
I love this. Don't leave voicemails! http://t.co/hB48AOY8XI
Everyone talks about how expensive Jordan's are...I don't understand why Nike doesn't charge more for them. Supply and demand.
Baseball&gt;football&gt;hockey&gt;golf&gt;basketball
I liked playing it in the day...but basketball is lame.
Let's quit pretending that it isn't because Ohio State is a huge market. #allaboutthebenjaminsbaby
You already had a title game because you already played everyone. Why would playing again help you understand anything?
That bad throw hit both of his hands.
Going to Jack White in Austin! Boom! @SSJWHB
K-state is on pace to score over 168 points.
Pumped for Cutler to tack on some garbage points at the end. Called back, interception. Thanks Jay.
I am so sick of listening to people justify terrible behavior.
If you have to cover your face, don't do it.
XM 34 is on a hot streak right now.
...or maybe ku just isn't that good, you guys.
