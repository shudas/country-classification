There's such a long, long way to go. Where I'm going I don't know. I'm just following the road, for a walk in the sun ❤
Really wanting a tattoo, now daddy's said he wants another one! Gonna have his girls names ❤ #livehim #socute #family #whatdoiget?
"I've never seen such a big wok!" "Shame it doesn't fit in the dishwasher." "Does if you put it in right." #innuendobingo
Dudes! Thai curry for tea 😍 #daymade #foodporn #getinmymouth
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair 🌼🌸😊
Life is far too confusing right now, so I apologise for my dick moves people. I shall try be a nicer person soon
Just me and this little man this morning :D http://t.co/9C3PMjMlqk
Someone help me. Never gonna sleep now! #sugarrush #hyper #timetokill
Why exactly did no one stop me eating two mint ice creams, half a tube of Pringles, cheese, wine, and 2 packets of fizzy sweets? #imamess 😅😅
Tay Swizzle on CSI! Gon be good! Even though I saw this one a million times already... Gonna act surprised. Cause that's what I do... Acting
Made food. Strange combination of Pringles, cheese, wine and ice cream, but I'm good with that ;D now for CSI:NY. So KimK, can you act?
Mum please stop stalking people on Facebook and then asking me silly questions about them. I don't give a shit. I gave that up some time ago
Love watching MasterChef but damn I am now starving hungry again!
I hate being bored.
What have Zalfie actually *done* to deserve a wax work. They used to be reserved for stars. Not random people with a couple of videos
I am sure I've heard this story before... ;D #interview #stocksayings #sofunny
Spent two hours trying to do work, research uni's for next year and now I'm dead. Nearly asleep. Least I have music...
And you wonder why I spend my whole time plugged into my music, concentrating on my own thing. #goals #motivation
Real sick and tired of your bullshit people. Getting old real quick.
Definitely should've gone on stage like this. Better than the uniform we actually wore... #followfollow #dressingroom http://t.co/AwXDjfyv4q
Is it very odd that I predict the success of my day on the number of cereals in my bowl? #notocd #threeonaspoon #oneisfab #twoissad #weird
Such a good episode of #OrdinaryLies tonight! Felt so sorry for Pete. Can't wait for the last episode next week :D x
May be 1 of the only sensible things Kanye's ever said. We have to make sure you're the one if we give our heart away http://t.co/5HlRKnopAb
Don't know how I'm meant to pick what to do next year. I want to act. I want to write, design, makeup, direct, everything. Help please
Writing a monologue in a cockney accent so my whole page is full of red squiggly lines where spell check's decided they aren't real words...
I swear I have the weirdest taste in music... #countrychic #popprincess #jazz #acoustic #electroswing #soundtrack #disney #rnb #rock #folk
On a completely separate note, I'm still loving @TomFelton's music &lt;3 #thatvoicethough #gorgeous #songwriter
How is it fair that you're that hot? Explain it to me please.
Must stop procrastinating and actually do work. But YouTube is such a distraction. Damn.
Isn't it funny how someone can make your day just with a word or a smile or a thought 😊
Growing old is mandatory. Growing up is optional #youresovain #thatsundayfeeling
If yer gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leavin'. If yer gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it. Baby if yer not, you'd best get to leavin
The party the night we met. We danced til the sun. There's no way I could forget chasing shots down with your tongue #wethekings #kissmelast
Cause every time I feel like I'm riding so high, feeling on top of the world, the bitch just keeps telling me no. #jealousy #darrencriss
"'Go.' How so very apropos. A goodbye just as soon as I say hello. Well alright, I'll see you later..." #darrencriss #dontyou
Times like last night's performance make me remember exactly why I'm working so hard. I love acting. I love being on stage. I love it all
Song of the Day: The Closest Thing to Crazy by Katie Melua ❤ How can happiness feel so wrong? How can misery feel so sweet?
Goodnight humanoids. Imma put this down 'fore I say something else silly... Too late young lady. Hush. Sweet dreams peeps 😘 zzz :D X
On the plus side I had a great time with my tunes playing in my lil Tallulah all the way home from Inverness. #cantsing #dontcare #itsmylife
Hahahahaha, I'm far too hyper and exhausted after that show and now my brain has turned to the philosophic for absolutely no reason
Think I might actually annoy people accidentally, and so they all just go away. Such is the talent I possess. #dontjustleavemealone
Idk, sometimes I wonder whether my presence in your life made any difference to you at all.
Guys, my teeth feel fluffy and as we all know, that's the worst thing ever. @KaaaateStone told me. Its just nasty. I concur
Dressing room banter was on point. Tunes, treats and stripping of course ;DDD #whatisthis? #stars #edencourt
Not gonna lie, felt like a star getting the backstage key and using the Empire Theatre toilets... #stagelife
I still don't care. It was boring me before. Why do you think we ended up here? More than happy to support people but you take the piss mate
Oh shut the eff up sharing shitty posts about bullshit no one cares about. Get a grip. We get it. Your basically famous now. Woopdedo.

Burning your tongue really really hurts... Silly girl
Dental Care has some of the cleverest lyrics!
As many times as I blink I'll think of you tonight
And I wonder does it stop your heart to know you're not my sunshine anymore? ❤🌞😆
I miss my Daddy ❤ #comehome
Nap was a mistake though. Feel worse now than I did before. Hangover 1:0 Laura. You got me this time... 😩
Well...As long as I don't make any sudden movements, and I can have the occasional moment to gather myself, I may make it through this shift
Had to repost this one from @buttermilchkuss after last night! Best fun I've had in ages! Love all of… https://t.co/08mX0B7iGI
I may have found myself in McDonalds again... #oops #fatbitch
Laura, in future, you shall not text people when more than a sensible drinking measure has been consumed. Learn child
Downside of nights out is coming home reeking of smoke, even though I never have and never will touch a cigarette. #yuck
Downside of not living in town means train timetables rule my social and working life. Might as well get the times tattooed on my arm 😐🚂
Now there's a nasty thought... I have to be up a whole hour earlier than this for college next week... Noooooooo thank you Sirs and Madam
Pretty sure Anna's Guinea Pig has been plotting to get me while I was asleep #haha #fitz
No, seriously, why? Waaaay too early after last night.
Why am I awake now?

Rotary is so weird. They clap everything. They're almost as enthusiastic as drama students #claps #weclapeverything #welldone #drama
Can't believe mum saw him live on the Bad tour. Jealous!
Day made better, MJ's Beat It playing in the kitchen, so I had a wee dance on my way through 😄 💃
Ahhhhh gonna be torture at work today
I think it's nice you've moved on. Shame I'm not sad to say, I'd gone before you knew we were through
#kevin and #karen from @bbcstrictly will be in Inverness next month! Book tickets now guys! :D #scd #latin #ballroom http://t.co/ahyzi677or
Dog has taken to yawning if you're taking too long to get ready for his walk... Sarcastic bitch! Definitely part of this family then
Hahaha, this is so true!!! :') 😉 http://t.co/2zN1G1RtiR
Then I had a dream I was at work and wasn't allowed to leave. Decided this is probably a premonition more than a dream...
Was quite sad tbh. My dog didn't look happy. And nothing fitted in my handbag. What does that all say about me? Besides *weird* of course
Had a dream last night our house was next to a volcano eruption. There was nowhere for us to go and I couldn't choose what to save...
Well at least I have someone in bed with me... Completely cool it's my dog, he's his own slice of awesome :D
My sister and I are actually hilarious. Bloody mental. But hilarious. #wedabomb 😅😅😅
Me and the sis discussing bonuses of people being out the house: weeing with door open 😉 apparently it's a good thing @RaisingCain15
Saxophone, orrr *Sexaphone*?
Can't believe parents would ever be able to reject their child just for being gay... They're your baby! How can you stop loving them?
Luuuurv Rocky Road Ice Cream 😍 #yum #fatcow lol
Maccie D's after rehearsal ❤❤❤ omnomnom, so beautiful, get in my mouth please now, thank you
Mid-rehearsal break 😄 last one guys! Last one! #ntconnections #edencourt
Quote of the Train... "I do like a nicely trimmed garden" oh aye love, I'm sure you do 😉😉😉
Smooth legs are the nicest feeling things ever. It's a dress day 😊😅😍
I've just found seven bruises, only two of which I know where they're from. What the heck are the others? 😂
Towels need a clip or something so they actually stay up when you get out of a shower...
You're pretty, your face is a work of art. Your smile could light up NYC after dark. But its such a pity a boy so pretty, with an ugly heart
Midday showers are the best :) 🚿 😊
Weather is super pretty today! 🌞🌞🌞
Having to strip entirely to go to the bathroom cause your PJs are a playsuit...
Minor addition to the day: No breakfast so we can get to the beach before tide comes in. At least its a nice day for dogwalking #roseisle
4 hours college work, train, 4 hours at Eden Court for final rehearsal for #NTConnections, train, home, bed #daysorted
Back to the bed I haven't moved from all day, besides food and a Tesco run for wine ;D #pyjamas #noundies #nicejumper #lazy #student
#OneBorn now ❤❤❤ so sweet! I love this program! Can't wait til Hannah has her little one so I can have cuddles :)
Well... My day off turned into 7 straight hours of college work. #dedicated #student #whatsaholiday?

Yesss, two days off of work! #heaven! I'll be in my bed if you want me!
When are you going to understand that people have lives and they aren't going to drop everything for you?! 😣 #getagrip
Thought provoking work http://t.co/G8NTcF0U8e
