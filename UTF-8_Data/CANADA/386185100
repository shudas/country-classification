As much as I love my daily naps, I hate how they keep me awake at night #ProsAndCons
If time travel was real, the first place I'd go to would be an Eminem concert in 2001 #Legendary
It's gotta be at least 90° in the computer lab right now 🔥🔥🔥 #Roasting
Nothing like a mid day cruise with the music turned up  🎶👌 #UPWeather #AlmostSummer
I guess I'm having lettuce and cheese for lunch today
#StandWithUs

Does winter ever go away? How sickening
My dog just fell down the stairs #lol

So this grandfather clock in my living room that hasn't worked in 5 years just started ticking then stopped #Wtf #HauntedAsFuck
Oooo, Stars eliminated from playoff contention @Milknutz
I love opening a can of Cope to see it's completely filled #ThanksGuys

I think the only time I ever watch 2 eastern conference teams play each other is when the Flyers and Penguins go at it #Rivalry
My grandma just referenced "the railroad tracks" as a place #TheyArentThereAnymoreGrandma #HappyEaster #Dinner
Tonight, I guess I'm a Blackhawks fan....
.@BuffaloSabres @DallasStars You both had one job tonight and you blew it
Something ain't right
I really hope I'm not hearing a lawnmower outside right now
