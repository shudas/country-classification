Throw back to me and momma 😘 http://t.co/tYyzGwGjjd
It's here, last day 😶
People actually go orienteering for fun? I just thought that was some shit they made us do at school in a hope we'd get lost
There's some strange people floating around this morning 😂
2 more! 2 more.
Wish I lived by the sea side 😭
Walking past your ex and pointing at them was not a strong move Han. Now you look a twat 😂
So mad 😤
😴😴😴😴
Why when i cant sleep and it gets to a stupid time does my brain decide now is a perfect time for deep thoughts and over analysing? Just no.
Sleeps looking good isn't it 😩 4 hours and 12 minutes until I'm up 👍🏽
Up in 4 hours and I'm wriggling around my bed like a plank. Get some sleep Bull!
I have 100% just fallen in love.
Just told one of my regular guests im going away for a few days.. His response 'ohhh don't catch anything!' Hahahaha
Oh so now the sun decides to come out? Fuck off, I'm going to work
Running around my house singing at the top of my voice. Don't care tho 🙋
Not how I wanted to wake up. Leave me alone 😤😤
My sleeping pattern is back to being pants again 😫
Next door are watching saving private Ryan, I thought I lived next to a couple in their 30's. Not 80's #aretheydeaf
1 down, 4 to go!
Wine is gooooood
Oh and Benidorm repeats, can't forget that
Home and wine 🍷
Reading #secondbest is giving me some major mixed emotions. Such a strong book with so much I can relate to, @CalumBest I can't put it down!
And add insta to that list
There's only so many times you can refresh facebook and Twitter.
Losing the will to live here
Bored and not tired. What a glorious combination 😫
I've come to the conclusion I could never live on my own 😫
In my pjs on the sofa watching BGT. Is this what growing up is?
I want to adventureeeee
Big congratulations to @Pratty_8 and @jessicalemxo on the announcement of their baby boy 😍
Oh, my mouth 😫
Interview next Wednesday 😁 #dream
I really need to stop falling asleep on the sofa and waking up at 4am 😂
Stray feathers from a feather duvet come sharp man!
Why can't I find the  #DerekSpecial on NetflixUK ?! 😂
For once the sun is out when I've finished work ☀️
Would anybody else like to make me look a fool?
Work 😫
Fell asleep on the sofa at 8. Move to bed now. I'm wide awake. #fuckedit
This weekend has been just what I needed. Love my friends 😘
Sometimes you just have to cut your losses and start again. Finished with this awful mood, onwards and upwards 🙋
If I was an animal Id be put down the amount im ill.
I'm ill so mum waits on me hand and foot. Why would I ever want to move out?
Big love to my immune system for being shit 😂
Manipulation man, manipulation.
Just want to be home and in bed 😴 #sleepyday
Shiiiiit. The wind 😳
Series 6? When's it on? #TheWalkingDead
Holy fucking shit balls
If glen dies I can't cope. I don't have the head for this tonight 😫
I swear I spend so much time home alone these days
Smashed it outta the park 🙋
I'm getting cabin fever now
Sleeping and eating are the devil on hangover day 😫
Late birthday celebrations for me and early celebrations for @zowestwood tonight. #birthdayprincesses
Second Best - what a book, bringing a lot of memories back to the surface.

Hello payday you beautiful thing 😘
Best bit of news I've had in weeks, get me out of this country 🙋☀️
Not knowing what you want to do with your life is the worst feeling ever.
After 2 days off, getting up at 5 is always a struggle.
Good day 👊
Sun is beauts
Nope, it's not getting any better. One fucking thing after another
Shitty couple of weeks, things have to look up soon 😫
I hate leaving my house before 6am 😫
In bed already? Mental Saturday night.
Nigel Owens makes me laugh 😂
Is it time for a day off yet please?
those little blue ticks are my worst enemy 😂
💭💭💭💭 no sleep? ok, cool.
The things I'd do for a McDonald's right now.
I have such a thing about being ignored. Don't fucking do it. 😤
I have a lie in tomorrow 🎉 a lie in until 9am. Ugh. That isn't a lie in
I'm in work before the postman even leaves his house, what's the deal?
If I hear one more rumour I'm going to rip my hair out. This is beyond ridiculous
It's too cold to get out of bed 😭😭
The only thing that would make my birthday better, would be to marry an Irish man and get very drunk with him every year! #PaddysDay
Literally just opened my eyes, I'm feeling the love already 🙊💕
Someone pass me the knitting needles, looool. JK, I'm still as immature as ever 😂
00:00. I'm 22. I'm old.
1. Awwww it's nearly here
2, I can feel grey hairs sprouting already. IM ALMOST OLD

I wanna wake up with him wrapped up 😍 http://t.co/lV2FTA2coS
Like 22 is a real adult age. I can't live off 'oh I'm only 21' anymore. I have to grow up. Fuck.
T minus 9 minutes until I'm old.
22 minutes until ma buffdayyyy
Long day done! Sofa and friends 😍
As every morning I need to get up but bed is too good 😫
I'm only up in 3 hours, it's no biggie but sleep would be nice 👍
I think I'm going through a midlife crisis at 21
Life is a crazy old thing
Scrubs 😍 #thebookoflove
Every year I watch Comic Relief, and it makes me so proud of what I did. Yet I know there's still so much more I can do. #reflective
I love my friends 😂😂
I've never loved my bed so much
Chill, cwtch and Netflix would be a dream right about now!
I've woken up late, yet I still can't be arsed to get out of bed. #NoWorkTodayPlease
I need a sit down shower, and a good old pro's &amp; con's list 😂
'Is that a really wanky story?' 😂
Crying at one born every minute, I've officially lost it
I need to pull myself together here!
So much to do, so little fucks or energy to give
I actually think I slept for a whole 20 minutes all night 😫
How so much can change in a few hours
Well that's made me look a mug 😂
Twilight in bed, today has been looooong
Thank god this day is over! Get me into bed 😴
It's the weekend! Oh wait, I work in hospitality.
I just literally can't stand it, like I hear it and I'm instantly irritated. I think I need help.
I don't know why the sound of snoring irritates me so much 😤
Being ignored is the most infuriating thing in the world 😤
🌚
😫
