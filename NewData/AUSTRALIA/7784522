The time of being unshakeably sad and then checking my period cycle - aww shit.
Moral of the story: stay in school forever, kids.
If I had known my adult life was going to be this way, I would have stayed in school.
The hardest choice to make this week is watch Gilmore Girls or Breaking Bad.
The hardest I have laughed today https://t.co/CWWTVO5wfM
If someone could give me a job and a place in a sharehouse w/beings that are mid-late twenties that would be super.
But I'm actually accidentally  hooked on Breaking Bad now.
I'm only onto S01E02 of Breaking Bad and I don't know if I can deal with this much stuff happening in 2 episodes.
Everyone's always all about Rumours, but I'm all about Tango In The Night, big lovin' a constant.
Taking the leap. http://t.co/nfJwB1F4EA
The time I can't find the red lipstick is a fragile time.
Gal at the bar did not hear me hollar "Sparkling", but I ain't complaining. http://t.co/nlb2sE4rnG
TODAY IS THE DAY, I GET TO SEE @OfficialEmery IN REAL LIFE. LIVE.
Ain't got no time for people who evidently have no time for me.
You know you've won your day when the brother palms off a free copy of @triplej 's Hottest 100 vol 22 to your ownership.
My feelings are conflicted when a cafe I really like post stock images of food and drinks to their Facebook page.
People who try to justify violence against women with the "what if they are the aggressor" victim card tick me off.
Also, motivation is a foreign subject today. I don't want to do ANYTHING.
If you really think about it, 'motivation' seems like such a foreign word.
The most ridiculous thing I have read on Facebook today goes to "If a guy asks a girl out... I think she should just say yes". #howaboutno
On the hard stuff tonight, mixing Pub Squash with Ginger Beer. Things might get crazy.
I AM A RELATIONSHIP CONSPIRACY THEORIST.
Not that I actually care too much, but it's become a recycling pattern that's beginning to weird me out.
There must be just some unknown rule that a dude must start ignoring me once I start to have serious feelings for them. #orisitjustme
Just kidding about that, I can only do all tasks from my bed today.
Why yes, I've been home not a full day from a 5 and a half week o/seas trip, of course I feel like doing the unpacking and washing RN.
This bunk bed honestly just feels like two wooden cradles nailed together.
Hostel beds should have a requirement size to fit people taller than 5'10".
In all my travels the past 5 weeks, LA feels the most surrealistic.
I think I might want to live in a Cali bungalow and have a pet dog. #lifedreams
Flooooooo riiiiidaaaaa.
The Mayor of Atlanta shut down the city today, shit's about to get real. #SnowmageddonAtlanta
30+ hours which should have been a simple bus ride and connection, hanging out w/ @Jeremy_Nation and @Heather_Nation and getting some sleep!
The past 30+ hours have melded into one day of hell that is know as #WinterStormPandora and Headache-inducing Non-bus Rides and Bus Ride.
I'm going to cry if this bus is cancelled. #thirdtimesacharm
I stand corrected, the aforementioned hippy is wearing boots.
And when I thought this bus station couldn't get more diverse - an actual hippy waltzes by barefooted.
There are REAL LIFE Amish people at this bus station, suddenly staying awake until the 4:30am bus doesn't seem so bad.
Leaving to warmer Atlanta and sadly departing from snowed in Cleveland.
The only thing greater than @taylorswift13 and @jimmyfallon is Taylor and Jimmy together. #goodnessgreatness http://t.co/kkWV4k3lCQ
Even Colonel Sanders aint got the time to be identified on Google Maps. http://t.co/SAM7Z3jvD3
I'm going to have my first ever pierogis tonight, it'd be great if I could actually fully taste anything.
I am so done with having a cold right now.
Having a Pinterest account is pointless when you share the same links of pins to Facebook.
Finding Mcleod's Daughters on Hulu is the highlight of my day, it's the small joys that matter. #tweetsfromthecouch
All I want for Easter is a healthy immune system.
Flights are almost always gotta be unfathomably expensive.
Valentine's Day 2015: Wearing pajamas and watching old Nickelodeon TV shows on Hulu while it snows and snows outside.
Clarissa Explains it All will always be the ultimate precursor of Lizzie McGuire.
Might have frozen my legs solid by walking to Target and back. #Clevelandwinter
Wanting to get coffee but @heyjaydeee isn't awake, should I just get her one anyway?
Annie should have Urbanspoon'd that. #Bridesmaids
That @okcthunder Westbrook sinkin' in those dunks like a DD's donut in coffee. #ThunderUP
Acne teen hunger force.
Sickness induced miserable mode, my whole body isn't working today. #coldday
Also tried softly talking, but I just look like a silent movie.
There is no medium to losing my voice during a sore throat, there is only shouting which turns out to be the same volume as talking.
At 10PM I thought a latte would be a great idea, now at 3am I am officially declaring I was wrong.
I will never complain about Australian winter again.
Starting the morning with a mug of Lucky Charms, it's only going to get more amazing from here.
It's currently -11C outside and I don't know how to deal with anything.
It is both blessing and curse staying over 2 miles away from the nearest 24 hour mart. #itsnearlymidnight #Ijustwantdessert
USA is the Glen Coco of free WiFi spots.
All-female cast for new Ghostbusters sequel. YAS! http://t.co/OzZTj79HEJ
I haven't even left the country yet and I can already tell I'm going be rocking the jet lag when I touch down in Honolulu.
I'm going to start a new series of photos from now on - 'Snapchats I make but don't end up sending'.
When you want to make lunch but someone is in the kitchen already making a four course meal for themselves. #hangry #smallkitchenproblems
Never mind, apparently they're separated now. I am behind on the FB game.
Keep seeing an old school friend's husband on a dating website, I am not sure what to do or how to tell her. Halp. :/
My Pinterest has quickly turned from recipe book to travel guide in the space of one month.
Welp, I may not have any plans for the weekend but I now know how I want to start tomorrow. http://t.co/hjBybkEJR3 @taste_team
I will always love you https://t.co/lDRc7slBBz
Leaving for my first taste of backpacking in a week, for 5 weeks, I am equally both ecstatic and terrified.
I have had that classic gem "Part of That World" stuck on my mind record player for a good part of today.
I'd apologise for that last tweet, but ugh, it just makes me so mad.
Those 'Quit' ads are full of bullshit, my nan died from smoker's lung cancer and never once lit up.
It's decided, I think I'm going to do a U.S. east-coast to west-coast trip. #couchsurfinUSA
Best Cheap eats New York Breakfast Restaurants @heyjaydeee http://t.co/UEKMyhHlrU
Three years I made a pretty seriously good decision. http://t.co/CCDJCvbkER http://t.co/KbPsmHyHVK
Hahahah. Throwback to when I thought this was cool eh @trisarahtoops http://t.co/rsGqXK5bDT http://t.co/erP51f2f5N
I laughed for a day at this goat, right now I'm still in humour induced tears just thinking about it. http://t.co/ef1bsQjVTY
And by living in Canada, I mean I will stay an extended amount of time there wishing I could, but then fly home.
And by unprepared, I mean flight home hasn't been booked. Going to live in Canada now.
Exactly less than two weeks until USA, I am simultaneously excited but also scared and unprepared.
Standing on a corner listening to Sweet's album in my high-waisted jeans, I am in the 70s. #bartheiphone http://t.co/UB6VBCRJJ1
Garlic bread has the power to make almost everything better.
Bed all afternoon, for days.
It's 2015, I should be able to make a clone now to do all of the tasks today, so I can bury myself in my bed and not do things.
I'm so focused on my hunger and desperation for a thing that cannot be filled that I don't even care for grammar and spelling.
11:06 and I am still hangry.
It took me three minutes to think and type that tweet, 'cause now it's 11:02.
The depressing moment when you're stomach is grumbling and you could really go a McMuffin and hash brown, but then the time is 10:59am.
Is it possible to take a 45L backpack as onboard luggage on a plane, as long as it's within weight restrictions?
What a shaking way to start a morning! #earthquake #Melbourne
