You would have found great synergy at @norcat with your talk on crowd funding today @UpNorthCBC .  We had Steve Tam from @IndiegogoCA
Lucky group! "@CharlesPachter1: Humber College Design students visit the Moose Factory on this sunny spring day http://t.co/qcxT2YR7ZT"
Bravo Steve Tam @IndiegogoCA for sharing session at @norcat via Skype.  YES is a great word to carry entrepreneur and ideas forward
Fascinating! Indiegogo not a gatekeeper. No forms to fill, no board to win over. Completely open and allows audience to decide validity.
Test your product and plumb audience with crowd funding is good place to go forward or change direction says Indiegogo guest @norcat
Interesting lessons learned from Tinkerbots and others who used Indiegogo.  Validating need and how to package worth considering @norcat
Sad "@cbcnewsbc: BC Ferries and BC Hydro are among the organisations that raised prices today http://t.co/mU9N40McAu http://t.co/L1o4t1A5sn"
Crowd funding can get you past gatekeepers says Indiegogo representative at @norcat turn NO into YES reaching next objective on journey
