Home.
After driving every time I moved (Seattle, Austin, CA, NYC) this time I flew. Conclusion: considerably less epic but way easier
TIL: @vanillaice is a host for the DIY network?! Lip syncing to sinks, homies covered it in his career
Let's just take a moment to appreciate that @MHJohnston links to his G+ profile in his bio #throwback
Cheers to me for surviving and thriving in the concrete jungle, thx @JetBlue :) http://t.co/wHRCbaOi3h

My @JetBlue pilot is doing a long slow lap around Manhattan on the way out, nice to get a final look
Last NYC tweet goes to @tmiale &amp; @MatthewKnell - never would have been here if it wasn't for you guys
Wheels up! Thank you for everything, New York!! What a ride it was #feels
It would be so much easier to leave NYC if I didn't love you all so much. A magnet for creative brilliance, it is
Thank you, for everything NYC. It has been so fucking real and I am so grateful for you all.

"In this job, you actually impact people's lives &amp; their businesses. Use that power for good" my parting words for Shapeways
So, @aimeeesaurus toasted my ability to get her random followers- who's going to be the lucky one today?
Every "goodbye" now is proper, so real, and touching. It's enlightening to be honest and express.
