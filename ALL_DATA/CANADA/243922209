Listening to that @DallasK ayyy
Looks like I am going to watch the Lion King when they come to Calgary
Can we please discuss how insane this Star Wars trailer is? https://t.co/BYZsPO273z
I’m surprised an institution of higher education supports an event of drinking until you don’t remember who you are.
.@djMikeHawkins my hero 😍
Listening to that old school @Xilent http://t.co/RrvBBaJbp0
Finals, I’ll be ready for you.
Loving @HellbergMusic’s new EP. Quite different and refreshing from what’s currently out there.
Of course summer weather comes right when finals start
Some cosmic confusion
I’m scared I will lose her

People are so needy.

“Spend Your Refund” sounds about right haha http://t.co/R113dfwjsy
“@SteveAngello: S-A | #ILESONIQ2015 | http://t.co/frWOBoVRth http://t.co/f9kMnmwhfd” @Sheeraz_A this line up though
I want that new Guitar Hero so badly
That will cause data issues for users.
One big flaw with the new music app: No easy way of telling if the music you are listening to is on device or through the cloud.
That original @Zedd beat is finally back!
The landscape mode in Music.app is also gone.
That #FRSRS1 omg
Hoping that Wildrose wins a good number of seats.
At the very most, they will form a minority.
To say PC will win a Majority Government in Alberta is an illusion.
Seeing @odesza live #goals
Keep it 💯
Really hoping @grandtheft and @Torro_Torro make it to Calgary’s #MDBP2015
Hate the caching method it currently uses.
I wonder if “Make Available Online” means that iTunes Match has become a true streaming service that you download when you like
The @andrewbayer EP just puts you on a musical journey of feelings, I recommend everyone to give it a listen.
Waiting for @ATFDL to upload that iOS 8.4 beta
iTunes for iOS confirmed.
Well it looks like iTunes on iOS i guess
Waiting on the screenshots of the new music app on iOS 8.4
The new @SAVOY and @SoundRemedy tune is perfect, a style I much needed to hear. Thanks guys!
🙏🙏🙏🙏
2 weeks… I can do this.
Got my dash cam, so excited to use it and finally have video of idiot drivers!
. @MDBlockParty when will you guys announce lineups?
Based Adham 🙏🏽 @Sheeraz_A
.@songkick is brutal. I had 30 dollar tickets for MDBP and the order didn’t go through and lost the tickets. Had to pay 52 bucks per ticket

US Citizens can now go to Cuba and I didn’t know?
Going to have a damn good time with @Sheeraz_A
✈️ Toronto: April 28 - May 6
Reppin’ @Skrillex today #PleaseNoticeMe http://t.co/kfdks1mW6Y
I only found out now that the iPhone 6 can record 60 FPS.
I expect battery improvement 😁
Restored my phone and set up as new, always a must when reverting from beta softwares!
.@grandtheft ultra set had me like http://t.co/bWmwgEyCbz
I really really really wanna go to Ultra but I don’t think I’ll have enough money 😭😭😭😭
Planning what I want to do during my internship, I’ll have 2 weeks of vacation.
Getting my skrillex shirt tomorrow ayyyy
Marvel’s Daredevil on Netflix 👌🏽👌🏽
I’m ready for NO.SLEEP 9 tbh @odesza

Working is going to be so weird.

The @NHLFlames are set for playoffs.
GOALLLLLLLLLL
Lines up outside Apple Store, finds out you can only buy Apple Watch online #LastRT
Kings got a goal… But Flames still have this.
I love the advice my parents give me.
Flames are doing a good job.
GOAL @NHLFlames!!!!

“Draw me like one of your pretty girls” RT @RealLegendQuint: @MrFijiWiji literally you tho #FijThePimp http://t.co/aKBArOqpuS
I deleted the Facebook app off my phone, life’s different now.
Getting my @odesza shipment very soon after 6 weeks 😊😊😊😊😊
The PC party needs to be out of power to understand they need to rebuild.
Wild Rose, Liberals, or NDP will have my vote. Definitely staying away from the PCs for a while.
