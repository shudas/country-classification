Sick and tired

This week is going incredibly slow

Stop judging people. Sometimes skinny people can't gain weight and sometimes overweight people struggle to lose weight. You have no idea.
The worst things happen to the best people
I am just an emotional disaster lately
People make me sick. Being cruel and nasty will get you nowhere in this world
Feels so good to lay in bed
Awesome
Scholarships are cool
Well a nap it is
But I'm excited for college &amp; can't wait to see what ball state has in store for me
Gotta stop getting into my own head.
Why do I even bother trying to hang out with anyone
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Guys it's not really my birthday hahahah
Aw thanks!!!! You're the first one to tell me :) https://t.co/39vMPWPeLl
School is just a waste of my time at this point
Lol of course we're talking about cold sores in anatomy when I have a huge one on my lip
Hate when you can't stop thinking about things that make you feel like you just got punched in the stomach

What color day is it tomorrow????
Let's all celebrate with lots of food and sleep :)
All I can hear is my dad clapping at the TV in his room lol

LOVE not being able to sleep!!!!!!
I could literally wake Austin up in the middle of the night when I can't sleep and say "pay attention to me" and he'd roll right back over
❤️❤️❤️ http://t.co/nqVxC2X9hB
Periods are a blessing and a curse... But mostly a curse
Need a personal massage chair
Isn't it amazing, how you talk all this shit &amp; we still lack communication
Having a huge bed that I get all to myself is so nice 😍
😬

I wish you could like comments on Instagram..... Sometimes I don't wanna respond but I at least wanna acknowledge the comment
No joke though I have to emotionally prepare myself before watching each episode of Grey's
