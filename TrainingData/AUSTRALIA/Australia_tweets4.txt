Listening to Q &amp; A it sounds like our Politicians are poisoning the food supply in the name of mining through fracking. Sell out scumbags.
The Australian is clearly inhabiting an alternate reality with it's carbon cheer squad screeching climate denial loudly. Vile propagandists.

What a cracker of a semi. Tension at the end was intense. Both teams were giving chances, but NZ just held their heads. #NZvSA #CWC15
4 drop catches by the Kiwis. The pressure of the occasion has clearly got to them. Advantage South Africa. #NZvSA #CWC15
This counter punch from ABD and Faf has changed the momentum of the game completely. Saffers in the driving seat. #NZvSA #CWC15
Credit to the Kiwis and particularly Boult for getting over those early jitters. Both SA openers back in the hut. #NZvSA #CWC15
Chances seem to be falling SA way early. New Zealand choking on the big occasion possibly? #NZvSA #CWC15
