Spent the first few hours of my birthday playing COD Zombi Exo Survival. GG 👍 #COD #ps4
Ps - Antlanta Hawks - boy to be able to knock three's down like you. Ka-kaw!! @ATLHawks
Waiters definitely stepped up this game. Just amazing to watch good decisions, passes and attacking being made.
Games so good. I can't concentrate on anything else! #nba @okcthunder
Dancing right now! Chocolate rain!!! And Westbrook on triple double!!
hawks just got a taste of their own medicine! @dionwaiters3 @okcthunder
