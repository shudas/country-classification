this warmer weather means #sandstone2015 is getting closer!!!!!!!!
mayday parade is so underrated
huge shout out to @HoldenMascarin and @iamjohnthelaco for helping a brotha out today👊👊👊
everytime I think of #Tomorrowland2015 I get sick to my stomach cause no one loves to get on my level like @HoldenMascarin does #wishusluck
the best time of my life was when I had Salt &amp; Pepper spaghetti every Friday in grade 12
it's not something I would recommend 
but it is one way to live
uptown funk is the sound track to my life no doubt
if anyone is good with settings for magnets on Macs PLZ let me know @_jacobirvine totally fricked mine up

calling in sick to my dad is worse than anywhere else
BUT FUCK THIS WEATHER
okay I'm not usually one to bitch about the weather
staying at an all inclusive resort isn't travelling
squad goals: the cast of friends
I finally got my new record player and I can finally fall asleep to it again tonight's slumber will be pleasant
aaaaaaaaand this is exactly why I don't drink vodka anymore
holy fuck I miss europe
working at my dads auto body and waiting for my Lucas Scott to walk through the door
all I want is to be at @Teetsbaby camp again
a boat is best in its harbour
but that's not what it's meant for 
⛵️
Tomorrowland2015 
HERE
WE
COME 💥💥💥 @HoldenMascarin
my first night back in town was a 110% success
thought I heard the start to a drum solo but it was just a guy pushing a garbage bin down the hall 
lol 
I need sleep
don't leave me in a Peruvian airport for too long because I'll spend 40$ on chocolate covered coffee beans
1 last cup of coca tea 🌿☕️
I am blessed, oh so blessed
shout out to my backpack for not only trekking around the world with me but for also always being able to squeeze just one more thing
Machu Picchu 🌿 http://t.co/a7qWv8GPpP
I stood in a cloud today ☁️
if Keith Hobbs lowers the speed limit I swear to god
"hey man I love you but no fucking way"
hairless Peruvian dogs are creatures of the underworld and I run into one everyday
today me and Paola walked around all of cusco on a mission to buy and try every single dessert we saw #missionaccomplished 🍧🍰🍭
#BellLetsTalk ❤️
the smell of a bakery ☺️
