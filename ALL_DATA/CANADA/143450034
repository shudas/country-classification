#TBT to this sassy looking gal in her floral print dress. http://t.co/mYQWDbrGo2
I bet Red Bull will be flying off of Winnipeg shelves tomorrow. #GoJetsGo
It's 6:15 and I am still at work. I have officially issued nap time.
Who is having nap time between 6-8 pm tonight?
14 hours from now, we will be watching the beginning of a @NHLJets playoff game. üòä
Nothing like sleeping with your window open and waking up to the soothing sound of a BFI bin being slammed on the pavement.
24 hours. #GoJetsGo
The end of this #HABSvsSENS game is stupid.
"Ref you suck" translates exactly the same in French and English.
Nice to see that hockey teams and players are humbled in the playoffs. #BecauseItsTheCup
Who knew that this #HABSvsSENS series would be so fun?
3-0 Predators? So many goals tonight.
Nashville!
So. Much. Hockey. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Go Islanders!
Goals for everyone. Love when the fans are silenced.
Bah!
Price and Hammond = Human   2 - 2
Wow! Montreal is being dirty...
Oh yes, yuck rhymes with duck too. And this Habs 2 goals in 15 seconds is double yuck.
Yuck!
There are so many great four letter words that rhyme with Duck.
Go @Senators go!!!
I missed the anthems because work...
I wonder how many people lost things in this wind today?
I spelled my name wrong in an email today. And how was your day? http://t.co/Sz1k2uPWod
How about e) None of the above.
I love @mikeroweworks dad. #SomebodysGottaDoIt
Drake did look grossed out after Madonna kisses him.
LRT: It appears that the people favour the @NHLJets over the @AnaheimDucks in round 1.
Did Thorbeard become Thorburn again? He needs to start the playoffs with a fresh face. #BecauseItsTheCup
My playoff bracket. The "?" box has the @NHLJets in it as the Stanley Cup winners. #BecauseItsTheCup #WPGWhiteout http://t.co/Z4KeiUoTNX
So. Much. Love.
Dear @LisaDyckpdq,

I love Pavelec and the rest of the @NHLJets. I also love what you are doing.

Love,
Catherine
Just when I thought I was Winnipeg's top Cat...
And twice on Sunday. #WPGWhiteout #GoJetsGo
I would take the @NHLJets over the @AnaheimDucks, @tinkertownwpg over @Disneyland and the underdog over the top dog, any day.
If someone could make me supper, give me a message and tidy up, it would be much appreciated. Oh, and draw a warm bath would be nice too.
Safe travels. üòä  https://t.co/YylNFh8GFz
Thank you to the person with the license plate "GOAL" that bought my @TimHortons this AM. To me this is a winning sign for the @NHLJets.
I wonder if there is room on the @NHLJets plane to take me to Anaheim with them. I promise to behave. üòä
The plan is to work my ass off this week and take Friday off. Yep, that's the plan. #BecauseItsTheCup #GoJetsGo
Happy Gilmore is about to fight Bob Barker on @CBC.
Please support @MiltStegallTSN and help exceed his goal of raising $5000 for #MS. http://t.co/e6uE3Qy81k
I just got the good news that the @LAKings Twitter account will be sticking around for the playoffs AND supporting the @NHLJets. Happy üë£.
Golf has a new Superhero. #Spieth
In preparation for the late nights coming up this week, I just finished my second nap of the day. #BecauseItsTheCup #GoJetsGo
Lots of exit interviews in Leafs land today.
Drew Willy got married yesterday and Free Willy is on TV today. I hope that's just a coincidence.
Whatever happens today, just blame it on the rain.
Breaking News: Hillary Clinton enters the 2016 race for President. 

In other Breaking News: rain is wet.
I wonder if the #Leafs have any current openings...
I love the rain, mostly because it's not snow.
LRT: That breakfast pizza needs to be a thing in Winnipeg.
How many more years are we stuck with Sportsnet???
A smoke and a pancake, minus the smoke.
9:30 PM! Ugh!
No one brought me breakfast, so I am currently making pancakes. #NotSharing
Now, if only someone could bring me breakfast...
There's too much hockey on my timeline, said no one ever. üòÅ
I wonder who @TeemuSel8nne is cheering for? @NHLJets or @AnaheimDucks?
I'll have you know, bedtime in my world is 10:00 PM. #BecauseItsTheCup
First @NHLJets playoff game is April 16, 9:30 PM?!?! Fine, I will stay up. #BecauseItsTheCup
I'm not sure why this "sky cam" is a thing on @cbcsports.
LRT: Not ONE favourable comment. That rendition of O Canada was embarrassing @CBC.
