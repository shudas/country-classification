Recorded myself shopping for a bed. Man I sound like an idiot. More after 3pm. @thehitsofficial
About to go pretend to be an expert on beds. Tell you if I got chucked out the store after 3pm on @thehitsofficial x
You're my hero @AdeleRoberts x
YES YES YES!! https://t.co/M0lssugNWm
Just rapped 'Superbass' on @thehitsofficial and only tripped up a little bit. Okay, most of it.
Back on @thehitsofficial with @nickjonas and new @Blondesound in 15 mins!
Massive respect to what @REGYATES is up to at the moment. So important.
Now playing @MOMusic PREACH on @thehitsofficial - such a tune!
Love that my iPad is defiantly claiming 'Not charging' and yet it's got 50% more charge than when I plugged it in?! Stroppy iPad! üíÖ
Oh hullo Manchester! Now this is more like it üòç https://t.co/jLsiKVOSDR
How much does an adult usually spend on a bed? Asking for a friend.
Wish I read things properly before picking them up. Sorry but WINTER 2014?!?! That's not even funny. https://t.co/5eJ4hq5zuQ
The ticket inspector singing 'lord of the dance' needs to stop.
In our contract, we're not allowed to wear heels on the wooden floor. Bad luck @GeffenSam üíÉüíÖüë†üë†
I actually don't know how I have any friends. I have no tact.
Hey: cool fact people. Did you know the Unicorn is the national animal of Scotland?
I'm going to learn to google before I speak next time.
It's actually cringe that you can see who viewed your profile of LinkedIn. You try and stalk someone &amp; you have to add them to cover it up.
The bile that spills out of people during political election races is inhumane. Be passionate with facts and figures, not venom #Hillary2016
Just implied that you 'have better things to do' and that you were 'like the wind' @whatalexthinks - please come back.
I'm back on http://t.co/7tPEucB0cK but just tonight okay? Then it's @thehitsofficial all the way.

Wish it was this easy for me to get to sleep: https://t.co/iy0cKrrbET
Just called @taylorswift13 a 'WOOOOOMAN' accidentally on the radio.
It's okay to say Sue Perkins shouldn't present Top Gear. A valid opinion. To attack her character &amp; insult her. You're 100% wrong.
Do you know anyone that's dating with similar names? #BarryGarryManilow
Back on @thehitsofficial for a delirious four hours! - http://t.co/lslszhGv1d

Waking yourself up with a sneeze is not the way to go.
New @EllaEyre 'Together' is an amazing tune to play on the radio. Bouncing round the studio. Good work gal.
Now playing @momusic PREACH on @thehitsofficial!

One way to make sure you never achieve your dream is to believe in overnight success. Everything you have done to this date will contribute.
I want to do something weird on the radio, any suggestions?
ALRIGHT LEGENDS?! Get the @thehitsofficial in your ear hole now. It's me. Thanks. http://t.co/lslszhGv1d
Thought the pictures of Cam feeding the lamb were cute &amp; then I watched the video as he tried to rub their noses together and it got weird.
Do you always have to laugh at jokes policemen make? Can you get arrested if you don't? https://t.co/kmsT69thf1
Just looked up from the desk and there's a policeman in reception waving through the window.
Almost missed a link listening to @Izzie__C do her thing. You go girl!
Can someone bring a can of coke to @KEY103 ASAP? I need some sugar!
Standing in for @whatalexthinks this week and it starts in 45 minutes! Have a listen - http://t.co/7tPEucB0cK
Anyone else watching the tell all documentary on @FatPresenter? http://t.co/RIpmo7umcZ
So it's pretty awkward when you slurp your drink in front of a stranger.
New rule: parents and grandparents are not allowed to have FaceTime if they don't know how to answer üôà
I have such a long body that I just had to choose which half to cover with my towel.
Just sizing myself up to 50hrs of radio in 6 days by going to the gym. üí™üí™ - motivational speeches welcome.
Flashback to @darrylmorris offering me the opportunity to spoon him yesterdayüò≥üôä
Going home to eat some cheese and sleep üíÉ

First night since starting overnights that I've worn tracked to work üôà
Happy to play it for you @thevxmpsclo x
My girlfriend is going for @NandosUK without me so...I need to retaliate. Lunch anyone?
This model on #FirstDates is not doing well. Literally the least enticing personality.
Wish I was going to @SRA conference this year so bad. TWO YEARS AGO the conference propelled my career!
It's actually ridiculous that my ovaries hurt every two weeks. THAT'S LITERALLY YOUR JOB.
I'm back on air! @thehitsofficial until 7pm - http://t.co/lslszhGv1d
Today I want your #isitokay questions e.g: #isitokay that I dried myself with a t-shirt at the swimming pool yesterday? @thehitsofficial
In light of recent events, his vacant stare is too much. http://t.co/qR7wU1Gi10
Feel a bit sick after pranking @darrylmorris on @thehitsofficial this morning. I'm going to avoid him for a while...
Trust no-one.
Awks moment when you create the #GullibleAlliance and then fall for an April Fools the day before April ruddy Fools - http://t.co/lslszhGv1d
Anyone know what exactly is going on with #5SOSALBUM2?! Who leaked it and where did they leak it?

I thought that if you fed cows strawberries, it would make strawberry milkshake. #AprilFools #GullibleAlliance
I'm back on @thehitsofficial and playing @JamesBayMusic and @KygoMusic in a bit! Let's go! - http://t.co/lslszhGv1d
Thinking about setting up a gullible alliance for April Fools 2015. Who needs a membership?
Want to hear a joke? It's not raining in Manchester. Lmfao.
During my time off this weekend, I appear to have caught a worse Kent accent. Soz, come listen on @thehitsofficial - http://t.co/lslszhGv1d
Hilary Clinton: The Power of Women. Sound choice for the train ride to work. üëå
So if Mariah signifies the start of Christmas, which song signifies the start of summer?
Catching up on #FirstDates on my way to London. I'm going to blush so much üò≥üò≥
So in Manchester, if someone asks you 'alright?' they actually want to know. I smile &amp; walk off every time. Southern etiquette let me down.
Just ate a really oniony salad and now I'm hating being in my body.
About to play @JessieJ on @KEY103 - TURN IT UP - http://t.co/7tPEucB0cK
1am on the radio I said that @ollyofficial would be the new host of X Factor &amp; it's now on the front page. It's like I work in media.
Hey @domstirling12 reckon my handmade baby shower card is good enough? http://t.co/lGzkwHDISm
LOL remember that time I celebrated a week back on the radio by doing a radio show in the middle of the night?! Tune into @KEY103 at 1am!
Got 7 instead of 6 chicken nuggets. Tonight's going to be a good night. Freakin' buzzin.
Pretty sure @JessGlynne should have done a Disney themed video for 'Hold My Hand'. Tell you why &amp; play it in a bit - http://t.co/lslszhGv1d
Hey @zoesmithxx thought this might be up your street?@KreptandKonan vs. @cleanbandit x https://t.co/QKcUfW6zaG

Someone stuck his hand in the tram door to stop the tram for me. üôà
Back on @thehitsofficial at 3pm for giggles and we'll somersault into the weekend together at 7pm with @So_Wright_  - CAN'T RUDDY WAIT.
Just managed to shave a bit off my nail in the shower. I'm scared.
OMG I just realised that Paxman did all that to make us like Miliband. He knew all along. #BattleForNumber10
Wonder what it's like once the cameras turn off. Does Paxman ruffle Milibands hair? #BattleForNumber10
Arguing about what the question is. Less defensive, more aggressive is Ed. #BattleForNumber10
