Matt Barnes is should be the first position they are trying to replace. His defence isn't better than how bad his shooting is
2 Quarter Clippers is one of my least favourite teams to watch #GSWvLAC

I hope this is the finals cos this is sick #ATLvsGSW
I think the person who would be the most upset from being traded from GSW would be Speights. He fucking loves it there, even on the bench
So is the fact ATL started 7-6 and then went 39-2! Wowee that's puts in more context for me
The %'s when Kyle Korver is off the court is fucking mental
Time to listen to Kendricks new shit finally. This guy is a genius so I'm hyped

I've only seen the first ep of futurama maybe once, but that first scene I've seen 100 times from it being in other eps #BoringFunFacts
Old futurama will help
It's been 20 minutes and I'm already concerned. It's been 5 years since I've had a phone that bleeps every 10 seconds with notifications
My phone has died and I have no charger until the morning... this is going to be weird especially cos I need to stay up relatively late////
WHAT A CRAZY GAME
DAVIIIIIIDDDDDD
I love David Luiz so fucking much
But definitely not a red, his studs couldnt be further away from out
The red card was out way before chelsea protested tbf. And i dont blame them if they really thought their boy was wrongfully hit

Old boys has made me somehow jetlagged
Guess those 2 cheese burgers as a late night snack werent such a great idea
So that was a vivid and long and graphic and grusoms dream that somehow featured @jamesbyrne1988 .
Now do I eat that second rustlers burger?
I'm not sure if I still have legs
As if bus drivers can turn you away if they don't have enough change... Luckily there was a second or the cunt would've made me late
I am absolutely struggling. Still recovering from lack of sleep (cant wait to go to work soon) #OldBoys2015
