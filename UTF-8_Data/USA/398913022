So nevermind I hate my life
Except I'm at work.
My life is so great.
And now the Duke of Calgary is putting on a fake beard as is tradition
I just ate lunch but I could go for a burger and a beer right now
Refinishing all the doors/molding in the house and I'm getting high off the fumes. It's a nice compliment to these margaritas
Or maybe it does and I'm just an alcoholic
The "you're an alcoholic if you drink before 5 o'clock" rule doesn't apply on your days off.
So I'm eating breakfast and instead of putting tapatio on my burrito I pour my coffee all over it... The maids laughed at me...
Um excuse me sir but do you mind fucking off?
How did we drink that much yesterday?
Sitting in the warehouse eating chocolate covered lays because I have nothing to do. There really not even that good.
