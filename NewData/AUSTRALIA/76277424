The kids next door kicked their footy into my backyard. #ThrowbackThursday #TBT
The new guy on the commercial fishing boat was promptly fired after grossly misunderstanding #ThrowbackThursday. #tbt
How considerate of my child, waskes up at 5 so we don't miss the #masters2015 final round.
.@Adelaide_FC win, I'm happy. @sydneyswans win, my wife is happy. @CollingwoodFC and @PAFC lose, civilized society is happy. #AFLPowerSwans
Farewell Ben Crenshaw, an excellent career, class act and great golfer, hope to see him playing with the Seniors soon. #Masters2015
Nice job Adam Scott. Birdie on 17th now the leading Australian #Masters2015 #Golf #USMasters2015
Titleist should have me on their commercials. "I can't afford the Pro V1, but the ones I find in the woods seem ok." @Titleist #Masters2015
Woke up late and didn't get to see any of Jason Day's or @JordanSpieth's round. Still plenty of great golf though, thanks @7Mate_TV #Masters
Nearly a hole in one from Jason Day (AUS)! Put another birdie down for outright 2nd.#USMasters making me run late for work. #Masters2015
Jason Day tied 2nd! 4 birdies in a row, looks like he's having the time of his life out there. #AussieAussieAussie #Masters2015
Two Aussies at -2, Day has a birdie chance here and Senden's round is taking shape nicely. C'mon Aus! #Masters2015
Ripper of a shot by @JordanSpieth from off the fairway! This young gent (born on a 27th) is heading for the course record! #Masters2015 #27
Questionable shot by Jason Day (AUS), a little glimpse of the old Tiger Woods and a no putt par from Sergio Garcia. Brilliant. #Masters2015
Jordan Spieth is 21, Ernie Els is 45, they're tied for the lead. This is what the #Masters2015 is all about. @JordanSpieth
Onya' Jason Day, keep the birdies coming. #Masters2015
The #WashCaps have certainly been the #NHLBruins Achilles' heel this season. Broken 2 huge win streaks and always outplayed us @Coco27Coco
It's @TheMasters week! Early mornings ahead thanks to @7Mate_TV. #Masters2015 #Golf
Nathan Fyfe has the "3 year old daughter who's dad doesn't know how to do hair" style down to a tee. #AFLFreoPower
Changed my tip from Port to Freo 6 mins before the bounce, glad I did. Makes seeing them lose all the sweeter. #AFLFreoPower
Goal by @Adelaide_FC #27, Lynch on the siren for a 27 point lead. #gocrows @Coco27Coco
Call me biased, but Fairview Park is such an underrated suburb. http://t.co/GaLeHhysp6
Active Community Cup being held in @TTGCouncil, sign me up. Twitter team any North-East #Adelaide peeps? @LifeBeInItSA
Bands and businesses who only tweet links from their FB and InstaG accounts, then deem twitter worthless because of no activity. #Derp #Meta

Man, Cosi's gonna be cheering with this week's ratings. @9Adelaide #CWC15Final #Adelaide
Coopers Mild Ale, goes down quicker than the #NZ opening batsmen. #AUSvNZ #CWC15 #GoGold @coopersbrewery
NZ lost 3 already with AUS bowling attack looking fierce, I better open a beer before it's all over. #AUSvNZ #CWC15
Happy 1st Adam. http://t.co/3SFHxkrxMy
If India are to be a chance, they need to make like a 90's ska band and pick it up, pick it up, pick it up! #AUSvIND #CWC15 #GoGold
Thought I was getting some of those sweet, sweet 5pm twitter notifications, because I felt my pocket vibrating. Just a marketing text. #Lame
"Working" on the weekend at Dad's and kids building time. Kid asked if I could paint a cheetah. Def can. http://t.co/Zk98H8JZDG
Got a #chromebook, was skeptical about #ChromeOS but for what I need it for it's perfect and amazing. @googlechrome @omgchrome
Pretty sure I just became a huge #Blink182 fan again after seeing Skiba absolutely nail the gig at the Roxy. @markhoppus @travisbarker
I get the feeling I'm going to watch a lot of blink 182 at the Roxy footage tonight. Hopefully there are some decent uploads. #Blink182
Work presentation to international guests tomorrow morning Dan? Cool, here's a bunch of pimples to make you look 17 again. #ThanksFace
"@BGlobeSports: #Bruins defeat #Penguins, 2-0, in Pittsburgh for fifth straight win." See you tomorrow #Washcaps @Coco27Coco
Long blacks should be cheaper, not as much as a cappuccino. Makes sense to me, but not to every single place that serves coffee.
Surely the Wiggles should've asked "You're not gonna' fall asleep on the job like the last bloke did, right?" in the interview @Lachy_Wiggle
Ellie Kemper is great in #UnbreakableKimmySchmidt. Halfway through the @netflix series and thoroughly hooked.Witty,subtle,quick,a must watch
The more #RAMONES I listen to and play, the more I realise they're just a 1950's doo wop band at double speed and distorted.
Enjoying the @TheGardenofUD on a lovely #Adelaide afternoon. #ADLfringe  @DulciesBus @Coco27Coco http://t.co/fmeZdL4YxD
There appears to be Tim tams for supper. I'm sticking around.
Font size of print newsletters has come up. General consensus: too small.
Derek from Klemzig saw graffiti this week. But can't remember where.
Everyone is up in arms about the Tea Tree Gully police station closing, even though present police officers say it was basically never open.
Aileen  has moved onto sewing. Looks to be some sort of sheer fabric.
Aileen from Enfield is knitting. This is not a joke.
They had difficulty setting up the PowerPoint presentation. Guess who they turned to. Now the young guy is the hero.
Discussion has turned to Neighborhood watch merchandise. Everyone agrees the pens are really good pens. Just tried one, they're pretty good.
We're now discussing if you can recycle it. I worked in a recycling depot for 9 years, but nobody will take my advice because I'm under 70.
live tweeting this meeting.A concerned resident has bought in a rusty numberplate she found on clean up Aus day.Policeman says throw it away
At the state meeting for Neighbourhood Watch area coordinators, feeling left out as I don't have enough ailments to talk about.
When an article states "anonymous image sharing board", you can assume two things. 1. It's 4chan. 2. It's not going to be good news story.
My beautiful girl at a beautiful beach. Spent my childhood summers here, now she can do the same. Hayborough beach. http://t.co/vYYrfWgUpY
Dang, just heard it's 'Island Music' night on @triplej roots 'n all, and I'm working late at the hospital. Play some ska, @SarahHowells.
Balderdash. Get on it.
Hey @punnostraw @grantjryan turn on @TripleMAdelaide now, Sam Neill coming on. @TwoPaddocks
Kids still up, they're going for the record tonight. #zombietomorrow
Driving around at midnight to settle a sick baby and @triplej decides to play Bob Marley, thank you so much. #OneLove #irie
Folk punk, where the rough demo is the final cut. Seriously though, Mischief Brew are the best.
Not everyday I wear a cap in the office, but I'll make an exception for the #SuperBowl. #GoPats http://t.co/130urIBBrs
Bruins win, 36ers win, Aussies win, just need the Patriots to win tomorrow. #SuperBowl #GoPats
My 3 year old is obsessed with Alice in Wonderland, should I be checking her room for Pink Floyd albums and illicit substances? #parenting
If my clothes horse were an actual horse, it would be in one of those crazy 951/1 @sportsbetcomau trifecra specials. #unstable #gluefactory
If you can get it at your local @igaAustralia, don't buy it at Costco. Spend an extra buck to help a neighbour out, not a $112 bil. US corp.
Happy to hear about Skiba and blink, but hopefully not an end to ALK3. Also big ups to @markhoppus handling things like a true gent today.
Woo. @smithstband at number 69 in @triplej #hottest100
"I wanna start a country, where we're not racist..." My #AustraliaDay anthem. @lrfwitts http://t.co/QVcpPE1tKl
Also, @mmmodernrock should play heaps of @TheBennies420 @smithstband and @LUCABRASIAUS
Why did I wait so long to get digital radio? Total game changer. @triplejunearthd @DoubleJPlays @ThreeDRadio @grandstandlive @891adelaide
Dads are great at fixing things because children are great at breaking things.

Some of my neighbours are having the old 'who can leave the Christmas lights up the longest' comp. My bet is on number 5,  down March 17th.
3 am, streets have never been busier in Fairview Park, taken in some family from Greenwith already. Bags packed. Stay safe north east homies
Alert from CFS that fire in Humbug Scrub is out of control and outer Fairview Park to evacuate. Well,off to @Blue_Gums_Hotel for a cold pint
Anybody East of Fairview Park #Adelaide be aware. @TTG_SES http://t.co/4fHnE3yEfn
