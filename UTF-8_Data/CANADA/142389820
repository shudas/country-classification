So... I want to go to Iceland?
Another fact: I only watch Colombian tv. Even though I'm in Canada.
Kinda gross.
Honest fact about me.
I'm so lazy I leave the old coffee in my coffee maker till the next time I want coffee, or I remember.
I made it to the bathroom!!! I'm finally up.
Well, my back now hurts. I guess that's my call to finally get up.
Is like if I have had y ass glued to the bed...
I woke up at 9:30am... It's 11:11am and Im still in bed.... I think is good I dont have a tv in my room.
I should probably get up from bed.
I have to keep going. No matter how many times I fall, I need to get up and keep on going.
How to go to the gym when you are all sick. I really want to, but I can't if I'm throwing up all my food...
All those things just puts my head in a place to quite the gym... Now I'm gonna have to start all over again. Fuck.
April is not being really nice with me...
Sad how my body is not responding at all... Sick last week, also this week nd next week I got surgery... And then no gym for another week.
I feel like shit!!! Ugh... Feel like suffocating, throwing up, dizzy...
Sore throat again. Pills aren't working the way the should if the pain reappeared...

Y el servicio es en ingl√©s.... Pues me toca ir a la otra iglesia Que queda a dos horas de donde vivo. La √∫nica con servicio en espa√±ol...
Pero como todos por aqu√≠ son cristianos... Y los poquitos cat√≥licos Que estamos tenemos s√≥lo una iglesia cat√≥lica en la ciudad vecina...
