She's bonie, blooming, straight, and tall, And lang has had my heart in thrall, And aye it charms my very saul, #robertburns
Kilmarnock lang may grunt an' grane, An' sigh, an' sab, an' greet her lane, An clothe her bairns, man, wife an' wean. #robertburns
Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing,  And loud resounded mirth and dancing. #robertburns @mattchambersuk @ROCK_ACADEMY_PA
Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair, That once were plush o' guid blue hair. #robertburns
But love, wi' unrelenting beam, Has scorch'd my fountains dry. #robertburns
Her smiling, sae wyling, Wad make a wretch forget his woe; #robertburns
How pleasant thy banks and green vallies below, Where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow; #robertburns
The stiffest a' them a' he bow'd, The boldest o' them a' he cow'd, They did nae mair than he allow'd. #robertburns #RichieBenaud
There's nane that's blest of human kind, But the cheerful and the gay, man. #robertburns
Ah, Tam! Ah, Tam! thou get thy fairin'! In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin! #robertburns @ganglesprocket
