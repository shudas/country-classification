Can't fucking sleep!
Started fitting new blinds the wrong way and didn't realise until the end. Done now though :)
Bloody freezing!!
Top notch banter by @LevenmouthPol  https://t.co/fVOHQVsNtT
Getting to go home at 5 today. Woop!
Why am I at work on a day like this :'(
So we have this match (25 mins), Taker match (30 mins), Lesnar v Reigns (45 mins) which then leaves enough time for Seth to cash in...
Looks like Nash has done his hip in lol
Told ya... #WrestleMania #StingVsTripleH #DX #NWO
Just waiting for some old WCW stars to come in now... #WrestleMania #StingVsTripleH #DX
Ambrose should have been on the scene years ago. He would have been a perfect character for ECW
Ambrose to win on this one. No fear when it comes to things like ladders.
Bring back biker Taker! #Wrestlemania31 #WrestleManiaKickoff
Anyone know what the #WrestleMania31 theme music is? Awesome!
Time for #WrestleManiaKickoff. Hope #HideoItami does well in the #andrethegiantmemorialbattleroyal
Little bit confused. Does the #WrestleMania kick off start at 10pm or 11pm (10pm +1) @WWEUK http://t.co/93M47qxRaY
STARVING! Can't wait to finish my shift and get home for some food.
Always awkward when you're on the dual carriageway, glance at the car next to you and make full on eye contact with the other driver.
Home at last!
Nearly home :) üè° http://t.co/apZfMooARz
Fuck it. Just going to walk home üè°
Stuck in Kirkcaldy all day with no money and no way of getting home :(
The League on @NetflixUK is so funny. A must watch!
Got to the end of the Standing Stane road and had to pull over to spew. Needless to say I won't be driving the rest of the way into work.
Wonder how much #Villa will be charged by the FA for those idiots invading the pitch during the game. Sherwood was RAGING!
Feel like there's razor blades in my throat üòî
Got @BBCR1 on in the office. Wasn't going to miss the last @zanelowe show! #ThanksZane
Getting to go home 2 hours early cause we're quiet :) RESULT!
Brilliant! http://t.co/yr3zK83qlA http://t.co/zkYmnYwEi9
Good luck to @mandymurdoch with her interview today! &lt;3 xxxx
Exactly 5 years ago today! Would love to do it again. #skydive #adrenaline #amazing  http://t.co/velmRKDSit http://t.co/zpQBVBoLED
I'd rather Man Utd win TBH. The've a better chance of defeating Arsenal in the Quarters and I wouldn't mind seeing them in the Semis. #LFC
Grrrrrrrr
What time is @WWENXT #Takeover #RIVAL on in the UK tonight? I struggle with the time conversions from what is advertised. @WWEUK @WWENetwork

Going to watch #AmericanSniper with @mandymurdoch. Hope it's good.
Braw wee walk tonight. Going to have to do that more often :) @mandymurdoch http://t.co/sQLUEVGyc5
I always think of the most random things! http://t.co/Z2iCmnmxu3 http://t.co/warAqXOWYE
Might then watch some old #ECW PPV's on the @WWENetwork @WWEUK
Only 35 minutes of work left. Then to go home and clean the new suite and cook dinner.
Actual in agony!
My back is killing me. Can hardly move :(
My knee is killing me. Hardly got any sleep last night. Just want to go home already!
Not even left work yet because of this fucking snow on my car!
#BF4 Premium pack is on offer on the Xbox One! Only ¬£16 for 5 map packs! The purchase will be made when I get home from work :)
Fast &amp; Furious movie obviously coming out soon
Really disappointed by a Sting-less #RoyalRumble after all the shit he's been stirring recently
Number 30 = Sting?
Is Lesnar not going to defend the title at Fast Lane then? They keep going on about who is gonna face Lesnar at Wrestlemania
Adam Rose = Russell Brand wannabe
Well that's one of the 3 "winners" out...
Yep like I said. 2 minutes...
I'll give him 2 minutes before he's out. #DDP #RoyalRumble
If this is just gonna be Bray Wyatt against everyone else in a one-on-one it's gonna be quite shit
Never really understood Sin Cara. Just a taller Rey Mysterio
I'M COMIN TO GET YA! #RoyalRumble
GET THE TABLES! #RoyalRumble
I'm telling you. The Spanish announce table should be inducted into the #WWEHallOfFame #RoyalRumble
What role is Sting going to play in the #RoyalRumble tonight?
Here we go! #RoyalRumble #RoadToWrestlemania
I was listening to some @Eminem on the way to work today and could help but imagine how good a collaboration with @macklemore would be!
Cooking my Super Noodles in the office and everyone is complaining about the smell. I think they smell pretty damn good!
That's the car booked in for its first service. 19500 miles in a year. Ouch!
Getting ear ache again. Not good :(
Check out my #FUT https://t.co/xzHkfUFFj5 #FIFA15 #FIFA15FUT
I can give new customers a 12 month half price Sky TV. DM me for details...
My neck is killing me. Must have slept strange last night.
Seriously though, it better not lay as I want to get home when I finish at 3...
IT'S SNOWING!
Money only causes stress! Fuck money!
Still think the same today. Don't know what I'd do without @mandymurdoch http://t.co/G5WP7e7SzK http://t.co/5Jxq86Y9fP

Not sure if the traffic jam is because of the roadworks or because of the flashing lights in the distance :/
Flashing lights on the Standing Stane. Stuck in traffic :(
Taking @elishahaggerX out driving after work. I advise anyone in Fife to avoid the roads around 4pm to 5pm today haha.
