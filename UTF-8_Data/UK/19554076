Migrants go back decades &amp; have always made a huge contribution to the UK.  I welcome migration and hate scapegoating immigrants. #BBCDebate
So @Nigel_Farage wants us to quit the EU but join a European Army?!  That makes sense... #sarcasm #BBCDebate
There's #NATO for a reason @Nigel_Farage! #BBCDebate
It's a bit of an #SNP v #UKIP debate right now and the Scots are winning for sure!  #BBCDebate
.@NicolaSturgeon saying what most of us think, that in @Nigel_Farage's world, all 'problems' are related to immigrants.  #BBCDebate
Ha ha @Nigel_Farage's quip against both the BBC and the audience is backfiring massively.  Idiot. #BBCDebate
What a load of nonsense from @Nigel_Farage.  #BBCDebate
Biggest applause of the night so far @NicolaSturgeon's comment about @David_Cameron being absent from defending his poor record. #bbcdebate
1 thing I'll credit @Ed_Miliband is the way he's so personal with questioners. He was the same at the manifesto launch, responding with name
I like that @Ed_Miliband pointed out #WheresDave.  #BBCDebate
I note Bennett of @TheGreenParty used notes so obviously where as everyone else seems to speak without notes. #BBCDebate
Yawn yawn yawn... #BBCDebate
Nigel Farage is the only leader who did not smile upon introduction.  #BBCDebate
Good to see my close mate @SimonPinnell whilst walking back to my office.  So far, so good today! üòÉ

M'darling late mum always had a phrase "Why lie, when the truth'll do".  So true.  Stop lying, I'm clever enough to see through your shit!
Sorry, I'm unaware of what Ru Paul is all about.  #crapgay
Small world! My good friends @Jesteroo and @gavinw88 have seen each other at some sort of Ru Paul event in London Town.
En route to the pub and one with a beer garden too!  üåû‚òÄÔ∏èüç∏üç∑üç∫
#Breakfast today, courtesy of @marksandspencer.  Yum!‚Ä¶ https://t.co/LQCxpMVJxU
Wonder if @TheGreenParty would care to respond to my manifesto question yesterday. Fair to say I've gone off them.
I think breakfast will be provided by @marksandspencer today.  Craving a yoghurt since yesterday lunchtime.
Nice compliments from my old boss to start my morning.  Breakfast meeting done.  Minus the eating of breakfast!
Loads of online companies always asking for surveys to be completed. Unless there's a chance of winning a prize, there's no chance of entry!

How many times do we have to hear "it's the hottest day of the year so far". Maybe people will just embrace it one day.  Nah! We're British.
Loads better!   https://t.co/VbFLR6wUDH
Right then, shower and then drive to a breakfast meeting with my old boss.  He's now my colleague, thanks to my promotion!
I can't stop, stop playing, this song, it makes me high üé∂ #lyrics

Nice to hear a bit of @coldplay on @R1Breakfast.  Still high on my list of acts I want to see live.
It's very foggy this morning - be safe!
.@TheGreenParty how will renationalising the railway lead to reduction in emissions? Why do they have to be manifested hand in hand? #GE2015
.@natalieben how will re-nationalising the railway help with reducing emissions? A Govt could sort it without re-nationalisation. #ge2015

Tories trying to live off of the Thatcher era?  Times have changed!
Music of all sorts today.  I can't stand the tossers on Made in Chelsea, so switched off Radio 1 for a random bit of @EscalaOfficial!
End of an era! Matt is leaving @R1Breakfast.  Bye @mattfincham. #r1breakfast
Not left the office this late in years.  Feels weird.
.@staceysoc and I are on a fat mission at work... http://t.co/EIbxuI1JEl
Looking forward to seeing @staceysoc later
I like the way @Ed_Miliband asked the audience to respect the 'tough' and 'challenging' questions and praised the press. #GE2015
Great to see @bbcnickrobinson slowly making a comeback after his operation. #GE2015

Really like watching @RicoHizon on @BBCNews channel, but disappointed he doesn't tweet much!
#HilarysBigAnnouncement is an interesting one.  I'd vote her in if I was a U.S. Citizen.  Good luck @HilaryClinton!
There was a hitch hiker at Membury services earlier and I didn't notice him until it was too late.  Wish I did, he was cute! üòÉ
