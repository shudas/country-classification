Oops ... forgot about the time change ... missed #TTOT again, but also nursing a broken ankle (done yesterday). Hope to make it next week.
Hey #TTOT friends - I've missed you all the last few weeks. Been busy moving out of Sydney. Currently in Narrabri #regionalNSW. CYA soon!
"@SmartWayRound We know it's late but happy #FollowFriday to our #TTOT buddies @DoroLef @JLipowski @MagellanPR @purplepatchmktg" And to you!
A5. Curious about #GoogleGlass. I know its not really new or upcoming, but until cost drops, I think it's still new for most of us #ttot
A2. Hamper ... We had a whole (hand-luggage) bag full of (mainly hubby's) tech stolen from a UK bus station last year #ttot
