Great result tonight #paradise http://t.co/2w46zulbTC
Great craic on the (training!!) slope yesterday with a 'pro' http://t.co/Lx7Ar8QsTe
Wishing the #BairnsNotBombs blockade all the best today @CNDuk
The #BBC should really work on headlines. Distasteful is probably an understatement.  https://t.co/2BjfiOOsGt
Just going to say it. #Wicked is more hype than substance. It's a good show but it's not the only one.
Story of life with a #Mac http://t.co/xu8yI5lzUB
Turns out #TheCrucible is on @NetflixUK and I can't contain my excitement.
Really enjoying @patrickharvie's aspirations for a multi party state. #GE15 could really shake things up
Jim Murphy has all the personality of a fork.
Finally catching up on the BBC Scottish Leaders Debate. Ruth Davidson having, as ever, a good debate. Willie Rennie a lost soul. SNP gains.
On this day in 1981, Bobby Sands was elected a Member of Parliament with over 30,000 votes. Turning point in history. http://t.co/hwvvCGTmUu
Looking forward to the return of the McRobert Brothers tonight at Allan Stewart's Big Big Variety Show @edtheatres
Having a disaster of a day with #Abellio travelling to Edinburgh.
Two years ago today since #Thatcher died. She continues to divide a nation in opinion.
Jim Murphy's patter is beyond cringeworthy.
Can't beat a bit of Coach Trip
6 weeks without chocolate or crisps and this morning I'm not all that bothered. Ragin.

Heading to George Square for the #BairnsNotBombs rally. @CNDuk
Third time in a year seeing Charlie and the Bhoys at the Barras tonight. Excited to be reunited with @Claredochertyxx and the crew
Saddened to hear the news that Cynthia (Powell) Lennon has passed away. Thoughts are with @JulianLennon and family at this difficult time.
Spot the politics student who can't wait for Absence of War tonight at @citizenstheatre (me!)
Catalina Wine Mixer gets me so excited. We strictly play 80s Joel
Step Brothers is just what you need on a Sunday night
