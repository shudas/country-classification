I don't understand it at all.  Puppy loves everyone; except our neighbour!  And he is the nicest man in town!
I am so thankful for the sun. It is drying up all the rain and snow nicely. And any winter blues are blowing away with the wind.  #lovelyday

"Will you still love me tomorrow?", by Amy Winehouse. Wow.
I'm home, in jammies and sharing sofa with Daughter and puppy. And not minding that my Hubby has the remote.  Nice end to great day.
One dance competition down, two more to go!  Next on April 23!
Where'd they go?  Everything was moving along and then it wasn't.  Crap.
Watching my daughter makes my own heart dance.  So lovely. http://t.co/7l2yqajw7t
My daughter takes the stage soon. Gosh I love watching her dance.
I love @joshgad   Absolutely hilarious!
I have twitchy toes.  Only at bedtime. You know what I mean, right?!
I want to travel. To Ireland. And the Carribean. Maybe I'll just roll over and go to sleep.

Puppy let me wipe her fur after playing in the rain. I'd say she is grown up,  except, she is tormenting the cat. Always a puppy.
It is raining today.  Actual rain.  Dare I say it?!  
No. Snow. Today.  
Yeah!

There should be daytime electricity allowances for persons with disabilities and seniors.
I think that Canada should adopt autobahn - like attitudes toward speed.  If no speed limits, all would drive to abilities.  I'd be happy.

Good comeback. "You smell like fabric softener".
They are singing "Betty and the Jets" and "Jenny and the Bets".  I'm not kidding!
I am pretty sure they are speaking the same language. The level of stupidity in the room is astounding!
If the doctor bills OHIP for that appointment I will be so pissed!  #wasteoftime #doctorwasanasshole
