Not feeling it today.  Just not there.
😔😤😡😯😣😙😇😎
Caffeine please😴😴😴
JW is lurking. Not sure I can keep him from showing up.  Breath in, breath out.
From Movie- I am not afraid of death, I am afraid of time.
Long day in the beekeeping world,  Margaritaville  time now.
Surely the world has gone to hell.
Just listened to sharks and a beekeeper giving them lots of miss information.  Thankfully they saw through it and passed.  Hobby land.
Some days I grow weary of being poor. Money isn't happiness but it sure makes life were smiling about.
I guess it is time to throw away some more silly dreams.
Soooo, dog, cat and Mom all went to sleep at 7:30 on me.  Here I sit and can't move for another two hours when I send them to bed.
Sigh!!!!!  Wouldn't it be nice just to have a half day to file and clean the desk. http://t.co/gfY5af30Yj
Ruuunnnnnn.  17 months.
So I cracked the box open a little. guess I needed to be there for a bit today. Closed it up again.
Long day,  time for a Birkenstock , Dakota Blonde evening.
Finding it difficult to stay focused inside my office after being outside the last 9 days.
Clean shaven face, switching brain back to corporate world.  Spending week with state and federal officials looking to design new programs.
When eating at Denny's , stick with breakfast.  Evening meals leave a lot to be desired.
37 degrees here.  BRRRR!!!
The south never ceases to amaze me.  At another fast food.  Never seen so many people work so hard to do nothing. #forever waiting
I may be old but I just out worked two twenty something's loading and unloading bees. #Feeling Young today
Certain places, time, filled with memories. Listening to John Denver.  To be young again high on a mountain watching  stars move at night.
Definitely in the south. Still waiting for fast food.  Gal in front of me waited 20 mins.   No biggie down here.
Had to laugh.Hobby beekeeper showed picture of doing 10 whole nucs at 45°.  Is caption was "this is hard-core beekeeping.!"sounds easy to me
Ahhhh the trailer trash crowd,  I miss them so.   NOT😤😤😤😤😤😤
I wonder why House hunters show doesn't have houses we can afford. Like single of double wide.
Someday I will have one, who am I kidding.  Throw that dream away.
Selling honey today. Love to hear that jingle.
I sometimes wonder what it's like to have a day off.  I here rich folks have weekends off.
Great,  ready for speech and they have upgraded technology.  Old Indian no like.
The intensity and poison is out of control.  The question is how to conquering it .
Blew out the knee again.  Went a good year and a half though.  That is pretty good. http://t.co/nYifT0WACj
I'm old and tired and ready to retire.  Been a very long day.
Whew!!!!  Sigh of relief .   One problem  solved.
So stressed right now.  Very intense.
I dislike people who haphazardly go through life and still have all the luck in the world. One challenge after another this weekend.
So I found out you are in Salina?
Old tired and fat. Southbound.
Burned up, spent, waisted, frazzled, don't care,  all me right now.  #done in
I'm melting, I'm melting.
Day two
Best part of day ,I survived it.  New software set in motion across entire system. Crashed 4 hours in. IT reset all bugs the rest of the day
Ground control to Major Tom.
Just had 20 deer run across the road in front of me.  Had plenty of time to stop and was able to count them.
It is hard for me to realize some days that my era is almost over. Strange feelings, Watching  it go by.
New day, dodge, garden , meeting KU , training PRI, peer support then aim toward larned.
Some days are just not good, anxiety high, frustration high. Old age is being a pain in the ass. Soooooo exasperating. 😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😞😞😞😞😞
Quit trying to be a movie director and go to 4 way split screen.  #@UCMMULES
Dear central Missouri MIAA CHAMPIONSHIPS.  Your online viewing is the worst I have ever seen.#@UCMMULES

I WANT MY WOOD BURNING STOVE. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Totally frustrated. Need coping skills tonight.  Oh wait , I have two jobs.  Coping skills must belong to the rich.
I could really go for a honey ginger snap cookie about now.
Apparently I am chef today.  Short notice.  Cooking for 42 people today.  2 hours to prepare.  Am I on the cooking channel or something???
Let's build a new software program, and not asking anyone who uses it,  how it should work. I wonder why it's being rejected.  # DUH!!
Wow nice to know I am not the most computer illiterate. Ready to go and several needing help.  #smokesignal
Life has just kind of sucked today.  Survival mode tell tomorrow .
Good bye my friend, rest in peace.
I love my dear Nebraska , but your speed limits are horrible. # back in Kansas.
Going through outdoor stores I used to dream of adventures ahead. Now I dream of adventures I did. #old and slow.
I think I may be under dressed for the track meet. http://t.co/9Wq8FPFso4

Obviously I am not trying hard enough. Time to rethink this process.  #screw head on straight. .
Contentment comes in strange ways at odd times.It is a rarity for me.  Enjoy now. I know tomorrow hell, insanity and pain well come again.
Great way to start the Grammys ACDC ♨️🎉🎼🎧🎧🎸🎸 HIGHWAY TI HELL🔊🔉
Why do I feel Clyde suddenly rising up.
Why do the damn doctors always want to send you to hospital and shove scopes down you. cost a damn fortune to tell me what I already know.
Doctors office said I need to be here at 8:10 to check in.  They don't open tell 8:30.  #standing out in the hall.
Brain totally fried .   😱😱😱😱
Time for caffeine,  LOTS OF CAFFEINE.  Looonnnnggg weekend,
I love the smell of wood burning stoves.
Must be old,  commercials we under whelming, some tasteless.  Kate Perry looked like she danced with two left feet. Not impressed .  😦😦😦
Wind  is horrible this morning.  Have to hang onto the steering wheel with both hands to control wind Gusts.  Burning through fuel.
People just do not know how to make milkshakes anymore. Milk with a slight taste of chocolate.  #Where's the ice cream.
The fat man is headed for Texas.
Seemed to be a good ending.  It was indeed the circle of life.
Seems I have been dancing with old demons last two nights.
Every time I go through the tool section at Home Depot, I get an extreme urge to build three pieces of furniture I have in my head. Not yet
Writing  today off as a failure.  Just couldn't get my head in the game.  Not an epic failure, but then it's not midnight yet either. 😜😜😜😜
Seem to be loosing at everything today.  Win some, loose some, get a few rained out.
Probably shouldn't be in public today.  Pretty bad attitude right now.
Our Company seriously needs a corporate plane.  Total of 5 hours on the road for a two our meeting.
No one awake but me tonight.  Everyone has long gone to bed.
Absolutely washed out today. #intense
Some days things seem to fall your way.  Having good luck today.
I am so going to crash in a couple of hours.  High pressure day.  Lots of caffeine to keep up.  #feelingZombie
My old friend Dr. B and I are having a nice relaxing discussion this evening .
Dear lord help me.  Difficult to watch blind leading blind today.
More caffeine required kind of day. Maybe even the week.  Big events all week long. #pressure.
I hate it when I have to be three places at once.Especially when where I have to be is not where I want to be . @K_Carrie  good luck, love u
Senator Hensley, you sure whine a lot.  And no answers to solve the problem.  #embarrasing
Glad to see not all deer were killed by the Orange army.  Counted 8 deer on our ground this evening.
I am still amazed after years of interviewing people that these two people can have two different versions of the same situation. .
213 emails later.
Such a negative Nancy world today.
California-the land of rabbit food,tofu, and Starbucks.  Love the sun shine and no wind though.
I so hate Kiosks.
I always have such highs and lows here. Still I walk away with dusty dreams, hope and hard reality.

Driving beside a Teslar.  Pretty cool.

Never assume someone is doing things correctly.  THEY ARE NOT!!!!!
My luck continues with travel flight delayed 3 hrs.
Seriously, the guy is lost in the woods and he is worried about the color of his aura??????
Nothing like being the red headed step children.
That is the most disgusting show.  No wonder humanity has become so bad.
Nestled down in the man cave, ready to watch the rose parade.  Trying to cure my cold before the bee convention next week in California.
Waaaa hooooo!!!  No blockages, not even a hint of blockage, strong heart.  All pumping  well.  😇😇😇😇😇

I woke up this morning and the world passed me by.  Sadly I don't think I can catch up any more.
Time for my annual Christmas song to remind me how wonderful my life is now. Hit it Madonna.   😜😜😛😛
Must have ADHD today.  No concentration at all . Office feels like a cage right now.

A test of wills the last today's, seems everyone  is very resistant to work lately.
One year nine months
I'm pretty much a Scrooge when it comes to Christmas parties.
Ever have one of those days where you feel like impending Doom is lurking around somewhere.
Always a bridesmaid never a bride.
And the last one goes into the business world.
Boring  boring, boring,boring. 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Always fun to sit with CEO's. Listening to which country they are retiring to.  Summer and winter homes.  Gated communities.  Geeeeez

Mach 2 and leveling off.
Reaching Mach 1
Through a garden.  Firing the afterburners to be in Larned in two hours.

Only you Kellie, only you.
What crummy timing.  Would like to be home tonight.
Didn't see that life changing event coming.
One year , eight months and no more trailer trash drama.
Finally got a haircut.  Thought  I was going to have to buy curlers if it went any longer.
Good luck Uncle Bob.  Hope you get a big one. He is picking up his deer tag now.

Been a totally humiliating and depressing day.
That's going haunt me for a long time.
