The scariest thing in the world is putting your own happiness into somebody else's hands
Thought things could be different this time but I guess not..
Nothing like being in a hitting slump our 3rd game into the season😊
Sore is an understatement
I mean being ignored is only the best feeling ever.
Who did it better? @alison_litz7 @kierstenhammond http://t.co/8qNUNbiJpp
So excited for Florida this summer
All these baseball tournaments in Columbus are really making me miss travel ball
The fact that I take the ACT in a week makes me want to crawl into a hole &amp; die and never come out.
The pier makes me so happy http://t.co/oOwe9G4QOt
Why is it so hard for us to play one softball game😭
Still so disappointed there's no middle finger emoji
I'm convinced that we're never gonna play a game this season
I hate those people that go exactly 35 all down Cleveland Road.
The only thing I wanna do in life anymore is travel the world
😌👌 http://t.co/IP6OUS87d2
This fog down by the pier is beautiful😍😩
Extremely jealous of those people that get to go somewhere warm every spring break
The worst feeling in the world is knowing you gave your all for something and it did nothing but screw you over in the end.
Miss this😥 http://t.co/AqmjMmr1ul
The only thing I've learned in high school is how shitty people can be. It honestly blows my mind😂
So fed up with being put in this situation constantly.
Lol how pathetic.
I'm already having withdrawals from JCT
DC is gorgeous at night
Why girls still continue to fein for drama amazes me
Voted most likely to need surgery/leave the gym on crutches all 3 years of basketball and soccer is something I'm not very proud of😂😩
Every girl needs a Chuck Bass in their lives
I don't know what I'm gonna do when Alison, Jenna and kierst leave me for college😭
#nationalpupday to my favorite mop Sammy😍 http://t.co/5z9dZw8rLx
Playing softball for a D1 college would be a dream come true
I'm having withdrawals from vampire diaries😭
It really sucks not having somebody to talk to constantly..
Why does everyone suck lol
It's pretty sad when my 12 year old sister is going on her like 5th date when I've never been on one at 17 years old😅😂😩
I need to go to a Schoolboy Q concert😩
My new obsession is Chuck and Blair
Dylan O'Brien is my spirit animal. (Vine by @feels4narry) https://t.co/0KxjHpvOsj
No matter how much you work for something, you're always gonna get screwed over in the end.
Our new softball uniforms this year are so sharp😍🔥
I want to go to a Gambino, G-Eazy and Schoolboy Q concert more than life itself
Why is it so hard to find someone who is genuinely interested in you &amp; would do anything for you?
You faker than some sweet n low
I hate getting so close with the seniors knowing they're leaving in a few months
I can never make it through a full practice without screwing up my knee.
*complains about going to school when it feels like it's -8 out*
*complains when we're in school till June 15 when its 80 degrees out*
I finished vampire diaries on Netflix so now my life is over
Our superintendent will delay us tomorrow if we're lucky. Huron canceling first yesterday is too good to be true
Yay it's colder in Huron than it is at the North Pole
Life is ruff guys🐶 http://t.co/DvBO6KlNcc
Most girls get excited over jewelry they get from their boyfriends but I get excited over a trip to the Nike outlet store
Losing a really close friend is so much worse than a breakup.
You know it's a good day when Harry Potter is on
It's sad seeing my 11 year old sisters boyfriend bring her over a box of chocolates &amp; a heart necklace when I'm over here hating today
Drake's new album🔥😍
Christmas and Valentine's Day are the 2 most annoying holidays when it comes to social media
Not really sure what's worse: being single every year for Valentine's Day or having to go to school around sappy couples &amp; the stupid hearts

Plot twist: Huron, Sandusky and Perkins are the first to close this time instead of the last
Sitting here realizing that so much has changed is gut-wrenching.
Knowing I'm easily my own worst enemy eats me alive inside.
People who would do anything for someone they really care about are always taken advantage of &amp; it sucks
Wow what do you know, Huron and Sandusky are left. Who would of guessed?
Find what you love and let it kill you
People are sooo shitty😂
So extremely happy I'm able to play softball this spring😍😁🙌
This is the hardest decision of my life😞

Knowing where you stand in a pretty shitty situation &amp; not being able to control anything is so painful.
My motivation to study for exams has reached an all time low
