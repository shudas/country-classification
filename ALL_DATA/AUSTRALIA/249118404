Toronto seems like such a rad city. Too bad it's cold
Scratch that, it's 30 degrees. Pretty much a summer's day.

Is the U.S. presidential election this year or next year? If it's next year, isn't it too early for all this campaigning?
If the pope can recognise the Armenian genocide as a genocide, then surely so can the rest of the world. Still waiting.
