The immigration card is a smokescreen and it's distracting from the bigger problems #debate2015
I don't get the whole nuclear weapon argument. If anyone ever starts a nuclear war we are ALL fucked surely? #BBCDebate

If I ever meet someone like that I'm sorry but I'd tell you to fuck right off

But then I know I'm so bad at dates so I'd probably be just as bad 😂 #firstdates
I actually want to shout at them sometimes though like wtf are you doing? why are you saying that ? #firstdates
First Dates is so awkward when one wants a second date and the other doesn't fancy them 😔

I thought I'd finished Looking with the perfect ending but now I realised I've still got 2 episodes to go 😭 and I know it's a bad ending
The first trailer for Orange Is The New Black season 3 is here http://t.co/5KJ2uruEfq
This series is just making me feel painfully single
Russell Tovey and Jonathan Groff though 😍
Watching the second series of #looking and I forgot this programme is basically soft porn
9/10 for effort
She's been pretty funny all day to be fair
Mum tried to crack a joke at the bus stop earlier but everyone just death stared her like she'd pissed on their shoes, it was so hilarious
The gay couple are a bit thick sometimes and it annoys me #gogglebox
Wtf is that gay guy for real? "If I was a kid now I'd probably have gone down that route"?? It isn't a choice  #gogglebox

We're in Starbucks and the man asked for our names and my Mum responded "Rashbrook"

Loved how they did the Aaron/Eric relationship as well. Didn't make a big deal about the fact they were gay and doesn't fit any stereotypes.
Just finished series 5 of The Walking Dead. Love that programme so much.

I know I sound 90 years old but ffs there are so many accidents and this way it's so preventable??
Can you honestly not wait until you get home to take that video???
Can't deal with people snapchatting/vining when they're driving. You are in charge of basically a giant fucking death machine fFS
I mean maybe some chips as well
I love the adverts where the whole family is sharing one supermarket pizza lmao no thank you I need one to myself (at least)
It's also really cool that loads of the science is legit, albeit theoretical.
I can hear my parents talking about the film and what they don't understand 😂
Just watched Interstellar. Such a good movie and incredible effects. Think my parents were struggling to watch all the way through though 😂

That was so good! Rosamund Pike was incredible
Gone Girl is so good. This woman is crazy....
The immigration thing has a hold over a lot of people, which is unnerving. But hopefully more people will vote against in the end.
It kind of scared me watching Gogglebox that you could actually see people getting swayed by UKIP's policies

An unnecessarily scathing review of what is essentially a publicity blip.
"watch Clean Bandit’s career die before your eyes http://t.co/RgThfc6xKi" the advert is cringeworthy, but this makes me feel sorry for them
Why are ready meals like molten lava/the centre of the sun after you've cooked them
Ruth's snapchatting me for advice on clothes from the changing room. This is the next generation of retail.

Directioners are having meltdowns because Zayn seems to have left to start a solo career, starting with Naughty Boy? 😂
That RT though 😂😂😂😂
Why is that Tidal advert so dramatic lmao
It seemed like a good idea at the time to abuse the photographer to get more photos but in retrospect it's pretty embarrassing
Oh God the album got uploaded from Saturday and I'm in most of the photos
I just don't know how people can be so self-obsessed.
Well I refuse. I will not give in.
And you know when they make really obvious hints that they want you to ask them about something
They're not taking in a word you're saying they're just waiting for an opportunity to switch the subject of the conversation to them
