Good news: guy who also had Dan Norris pun as fantasy team name has changed his. Bad news: it's waaaaaaaay better than mine now

Might just call the team the Isotopes and call it a day.
And now another guy has named his team after Dan Norris' van!
I currently have Van Norrison. Pretty proud of that. But do people still know who Van Morrison is?
The amount of stress I feel about picking a fantasy baseball team name is unhealthy
