John Wilkes Booth; the man who assassinated Lincoln on April 14th, 1865. http://t.co/RQJxiQrkcD
Thanks a lot, Twitter. Actually,  it's kind of creepy,  when I think about it!
I thought of taking a pic;completely black, to post when Lincoln died; to imply a void. I wasn't planning on all my pics turning into one!

It's been like this for several hours now.
Anyone else experienced this? They're fine on my computer and I can click on other people's pics and get to them. Just not my account.
Twitter won't show my photos on my Android phone. When I click on one, the screen goes black, then says, Twitter has suddenly stopped.

My iPod is still on shuffle while I sent that tweet. It was playing the haunting song, 'Bird of Paradise' by Snowy White.
Lincoln was shot at approx 10.13pm, 150 years ago. Sydney is 14 hours ahead of Washington time; but I plan to send this at 10.13pm, my time.
