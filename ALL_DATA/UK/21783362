No surprise there 😂😂 #SNP http://t.co/xadzgfM4IO
So Ed would much rather keep David Cameron in than work with the SNP...
Certainly no love lost between @NicolaSturgeon and @Nigel_Farage anyway 😂😂
Don't have a TV so getting to watch the Debate now. Rants ahead people, rants ahead #BBCDebate
What the fuck is wrong with this world. That's twice this week I've read about human remains getting found. Thoughts go out to the family 💕
If you're from Aberdeen and interested in supporting some live bands, come along to Downstairs on… https://t.co/juz29jF2EE
If anyone can edit videos/make videos could you please give me DM would be greatly appreciated if someone could help me out here :)
Wtf why is my phone randomly telling people I'm fucking screen shotting them
Why do people post mean comments to get a reply from the person? I see it on so many videos. So stupid, if you've nothing nice to say then✋🏼
Oh bye bye Moore #arbroathfc

Had a braw wee walk down the beach today with itspetra_ I'm loving this weather 🌞 https://t.co/c9hzEJyqSS
Last shift tomorrow then off to Smokie toon and I'm off work for a week wooo! 👍
Did it ever occur to people that these politicians are worried about a 2nd referendum because maybe next time they won't have the same luck
I need to stop watching debates, getting so riled up 😂 #leadersdebate
In previous years the people of Scotland voted Labour and got Tories. Can Jim Murphy quit it with the vote SNP get Tories. #leadersdebate
"This election we are having isn't a re run of the referendum" - Words from Jim Murphy. Can you shut up about it then? #leadersdebate
"Would you prevent a referendum from happening again" - Ruth, let the people decide because a lot more people are now more educated
God, the unionists are obsessed with bringing up the referendum don't they. Gee it a rest #leadersdebate
James Cook is genuinely such an irritating host #leadersdebate
Let's all pick on Nicola, how about stop bashing snp and tell people why they should trust you as a politician #leadersdebate
Can I just clarify that we wouldn't even be independent yet had we got a yes vote. Your shite is irrelevant #leadersdebate
Patrick barely speaks a word whilst they all speak over each other yet he gets his chance and they're still butting in 😡 #leadersdebate
Here we go, referendum talks again #leadersdebate
Jim Murphy's voice just honestly goes right through me. Especially when he speaks over everyone #leadersdebate
Ach, I do love Patrick Harvey #leadersdebate
Oh my fucking God. Why is he even speaking. UKIP are a waste of bloody space #leadersdebate
Just been told this debate isn't live.. Looking forward to watching what the BBC edit out to make SNP look bad 😂😂 #leadersdebate
Let the witch hunt begin 😂 #leadersdebate
Jim Murphy's not even been on the screen a minute and I'm already riled up 😂 #leadersdebate
👌👍 http://t.co/Lnq6cCDUIz
I don't like Ruth, but I liked that. "There is a huge difference between you and me, you crashed the economy, we are trying to rebuild it"
Nicola hit the nail on the head. If the people of Scotland want another referendum then who are they to disagree?! #ScotDebates
Ruth Davidson does my nut in as well #ScotDebates
Want more jobs for young people? How about lowering the retirement age?! #ScotDebates
Jim Murphy makes my blood boil so much, always got a stinking attitude 😡 #ScotDebates
My wee nephew 💕💕 http://t.co/EGvIGK3tmu
I really hope we get more sunny days, I actually am starting to like the sun now lol 👍🌞 https://t.co/MCDvYuEAXr

Love a bit of monopoly on a Saturday night 👌#Thewalkingdead #monopoly https://t.co/MV4diwtSKQ
Normal Saturday night, Kin 👌 https://t.co/U5nJ8E2GDB
I love annoying @poppunk1503 😂😂😂 http://t.co/L4jrvCJtsU
I wish Twitter would have a like button, some tweets i like but are not worthy of a favourite 😂😂
Nooooo I don't want to see the trailer of paper towns I'm nearly finished the book, let my imagination be for now! 😂
Watching a programme about the death penalty, quite interesting really. Not quite sure what my opinion on the penalty is..
Again, Twitter word count wasn't enough 😂 #bbcqt http://t.co/31FTM8abik
#godblessamilypankurst
Not being funny but for a country that is of great importance to the United Kingdom I don't feel very loved - as a scot 😂 #bbcqt
Why have we not got anyone on the panel from SNP tonight, they seem to be main topic tonight. Always back to SNP bashing. #bbcqt
Michael Gove - I really want to wipe the smug look on his face! #Bbcqt
Yasmin Alibhai-Brown actually spoke some sense there. Always hate on SNP. I thought Scotland were a vital part to the UK?! #bbcqt
Can we actually change the record? Hate on the SNP all you want but do you want to think about why people support them so much? #bbcqt
Exactly, what if the Scotland's don't want to bloody leave Europe #questiontime
😂😂😂 http://t.co/eg8oLQKxT6
Not that I'm a feminist or anything but Nicola Sturgeon, Natalie Bennett &amp; Leanne Wood are 3 great leaders.. 3 women right there ;)
Twitter word count won't let me express my annoyance so here's my facebook status 😂😡 #electiondebate #leadersdabate http://t.co/gvDgpIRnMF
Watching #ITVDebate I can already feel myself getting riled up 😂😂😂
Actually quite proud of this stir fry because it tasted decent 😂😂 #slimmingworld #stirfry https://t.co/Lz31OMszKP
Just in case you all hadn't realised.. I'm just a bit excited for @DownloadFest today haha
I'd rather you hate me for everything I am than have you love me for something that I can't
I'd rather hate you for everything you are than ever love you for something you are not
In the end we're all just chalk lines on the concrete, Drawn only to be washed away. For the time that I've been given, I am what I am
Also excited to see these babes!! @annalandixx &amp; @HolyBallBags #downloadfestival http://t.co/Bqmw9JfPFh

Nothing to watch on tv and #questiontime is on but can't watch it because I always watch it with @Smokiebandit36 so we can rant together😂
Oh my god Janet Street Porter really needs to shut up once in her life😡
Is this discounted because Zayn left #OneDirection 😂😂 http://t.co/qUkF62PM2V
Are they for fucking real? I dread to think what they'd be like when that disaster boy group actually do break up. Get a grip!
People are out there with real fucking mental illnesses struggling in day to day life and stupid one direction fans are doing #cut4zayn
Mr pretzels always burns my bloody pretzel!!
Awkward when the guy comes in the pretzel shop to ask for a cinema and the women makes him a cinnamon pretzel 😂😂😂
Who geez a donkey's shite if that Zayn has left one direction, maybe now he's heading in the right direction 😂😂
As much as I love Jeremy Clarkson I'm sorry but in no way is the BBC dropping him 'Breaking News' @BBCNews get your priorities straight
I used to love @JamesBennewith but he's like a different guy now, rarely see him smile on #TOWIE such a shame
Such sad news about Chris Hardman, I was a huge fan of lil Chris when I was younger. Thoughts are with his family at this horrible time 💕💕
Ohhh more @DropkickMurphys on #TOWIE makes this episode worth watching 😂 don't know why I watch this shite though lol
Catching up on a bit of #TOWIE and I hear @DropkickMurphys shipping up to Boston, nice wee surprise
