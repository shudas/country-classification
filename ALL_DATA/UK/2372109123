New chewbacca looks more like 1977 chewbacca, rather than Empire or Jedi chewbacca. Hair slicked back.
Has Andrew Neil gone insane ?
The future NHS doctor should have got a round of applause.

Jo Swinson was pretty great just now on Question Time.
BBC2 Scotland is not online, but Scotland 2015 is on the Parliament channel right now.
Woman on BBC votes tory and found Nicola Sturgeon "too aggressive".
WOW.  Guy on BBC was going to vote UKIP but would have voted SNP if he could :-O
So Emily Maitland gets actual interviews and John Pienaar just insults people.
Here we go again.
Danny Alexander is still talking.
Why do Hague and Danny Alexander get a long time to talk and SNP and Labour got 2 rushed minutes with John Pienaar ?
That was awful.  John Pienar did all the talking and Humza never said anything.
William Hague is the most annoying person on television right now..
Anybody missing Cameron or Clegg in the #BBCDebate ?
Figured it out.  I set the dataSource in init and a base class overrode it in viewDidLoad
Anyone know of a situation where a tableview will call numberOfSections, numberOfRow, heightForRow, but NOT cellForRow ?
Sept/Oct is getting crowded for a Cocoa conference :-/  CocoaLove, PragmaConf, iOSDevUK, ReleaseNotes, etc etc
Found some old videos of Hope.  The first one is AWESOME.

Earlier UK release than US :-)
6 tickets booked for Age of Ultron for April 25th.  (Taking a bunch of boys for isaacs birthday :)
Mirrors are weird.
Getting a ZFR of new $DAYJOB app together this week.  Time to get CI working: 9 hours. Time to get Testflight Betas working: 15 minutes.
Nate's funeral in Six Feet Under is still the most affecting episode of television I've ever seen.  I was crying uncontrollably for *hours*.
ARGH HOW MUCH DO I HATE THE 'MAGIC' WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK. http://t.co/zSygc1Q8oO
Pretty excited. http://t.co/00CZEKbxJY
Looking at apple watch in person at the store.  Mostly full of people incredulous at the Edition prices when it looks identical to the steel
Beautiful day to work in the sunshine in Edinburgh. http://t.co/m9C4hUD71f
When I was 17 "power of lard" was what passed for dance music.

http://t.co/ophmMgJuTm  kind of amazing how afraid of the SNP Westminster parties are.
Any appetite for a Scottish WWDC week thing?

I guess it's because turnout for Euro elections is so low, the diehard europhiles and europhobes can make a huge impact :-/
I did not know that UKIP were the largest British party in the European Parliament.

And, as far as I'm concerned, it has.  Logs look good, test are all fine.  We're done.  Xcode thinks we're done.
If I select "Cancel integration" for 11, I get a message saying its already completed.
Integration 12 is queued up behind it saying pending.
Integration 11 appears stuck saying "Uploading".  Where, I don't know.
OK, more tweeting in the hopes of a magic fix.
I will of course be requiring T-shirt mule if anyone is heading to the mothership.
RIP Percy Sledge.
I've been wrestling with it for 2 hours now and as soon as I tweet it just takes it upon itself to start responding.
I SWEAR TO GOD THIS SERVER IS WATCHING ME TWEET.
Logs are full of "realpath() returned NULL for /var/root/Library/Caches/xcscontrol"
Viewing bots in the browser just shows spinners.
Server.app just says everything is green for Xcode.
I *HATE* how opaque the whole thing is.  Local Xcode shows bots and number of integrations, but not the actual integrations.
Well I seem to have completely broken our CI system by updating the server to 10.10.3 and Xcode 6.3 *sigh*
The thing seems to say if you get picked, you get billed, end of story.  Its not winning a "chance to buy"
Can I confirm that if  enter the WWDC lottery and win, I can pass the ticket onto someone else on my team ?
I'm not particularly sad to miss WWDC, but I am very sad to miss that week with friends in SF.
Holy Crap.  As soon as I posted that the checkbox magically enabled its self.  So I checked it.  And now it works.  WTF.
Why would the "allow remote administration using Server" checkbox be disabled ? https://t.co/yVejA4x9Xw
"the epicentre of change" - Now ResearchKit collects mass M7 data to predict earthquakes.
Hmm.  A 1Password update just broke 1Password on my Yosemite 2008 iMac. //@MrRooni Any ideas ? http://t.co/2wKlsELi7v
"epicenter" ?  Mac OSX 10.11 - San Andreas Fault
Is there any overhead to installing server.app if I don't actually want to run any services, just use it a client for a remote server ?
