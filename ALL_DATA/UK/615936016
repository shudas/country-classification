So close yet so far
Wouldn't mind a rugby girl tbh

These moves from this guy at the links market https://t.co/VRGXWBooVd
School is actually too much effort today

Fuck, what have I done
'Whats the point on getting married and doing the bloody shopping yourself' - Delboy Trotter
Ok, maybe my hair is a little too short...
All I have done is watch rugby all day
Come on Germany, I am rooting the under dogs @MelroseRugby
What a suit @MelroseRugby http://t.co/BdrkreopHN
Ok, I have lost all of my flashcards for my Scottish text, I cant be bothered making them again
Revising drama just gives me bad flashbacks to my Scottish peice which I fucked up. This is depressing.
Finally got a haircut
My sister looks so chavy with her new highlights
Why the fuck did I sign up for this. Having to get up at 7:45 was not a smart idea.
I had such an amazing afternoon with @Victoria_Bett and the weather couldn't have been better. I wish I didn't have to end.
I am such a shit boyfriend
I am actually doing fuck all this weekend
Who has got the videos from drama?????
Hopefully tomorrow is better though, I cbf with another day like this
I cant get over how I fucked up my drama exam, I have no idea what happened
Such a shit day. So depressed that I won't be rehearsing with everyone in drama, it makes me soo sad.
Had an amazing first date with @Victoria_Bett it couldn't have gone better
I have no friends
I am actually soo lonely
Oh yeah great guys, thanks alot
Watch out dunfermline, there is a tsunami of tears coming from woodmill
Sunday is going to be such a good day
Having no data is actually heart breaking
Best weekend ever!! Apart from the six nations finishing
In a good way of course
That was unexpected

Wales are getting sloppy #ITAvWAL
For fuck sake Wales
"@RugbyBanterPag3: "Bring back the 5 Nations" 

Ireland and England fans." Haha they wish
An explosion of tries is an understatement #ITAvWAL
Wales cousd do this with their eyes closed
Someone had to be thumped in the 6 nations #ITAvWAL
Wales need to defend very well now #ITAvWAL
France are out of the run for the title
Thats a good try from a forward #ITAvWAL
Well done warburton, deserves it #ITAvWAL
No try for wales, fair enough #ITAvWAL
13 man line-out someone's getting cocky #ITAvWAL
I think italy might be on their siesta #ITAvWAL  @Eat_Sleep_Rugby @RugbyBanterPag3
Ok the gates have been dragged off of their hinges now #ITAvWAL
