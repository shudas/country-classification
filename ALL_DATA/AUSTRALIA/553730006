Nothing beats the sound of a V10 Formula 1 engine.. These new engines just sound childish #F1 #AusGP
Let's b honest,both teams are moneybags.At least 1 team played with passion without their best player and not like despicable cunts #CHEPSG
2 back to back corners, 2 headers on goal, 1 goal. Is there a better header of the ball than T.Silva? #CHEPSG
What a leap &amp; looping header from T.Silva.. Totally making amends for his silly penalty give away earlier #CHEPSG
FUUUUUUUCK PSG!!!!! #CHEvsPSG
Wow this #CHEvsPSG is some match! Extra time now..
This Everton vs. Leicester City is making me fall asleep 😴😴
Power la West Ham!

And great company with maadu and aadu @Laveen29 @lxvynht it was a wonderful day
And also, cause I had a beauty with me who looked like a darling in her simple punjabi suit and little pottu @sasha_devi
The music, the lights, the colours, the devotion, the street parties, the spectacle.. Must be the result of me being away too long..
Never been a big fan of Thaipusam or large Indian gatherings, but somehow I kinda enjoyed it this year.
Hate starting my days like this and it's been too often. The kinda shit that makes me wanna punch and break everything
Drinking like a Saharan tank.. 😲😲
❤ RT"@sasha_devi: Cos @rajneesh_gunner is finally back 💕 http://t.co/jNkk2GQjQx"
Feel like I'm watching mothball instead of football for this Australia vs South Korea.. Seriously
Major room cleanup, spick and span before I leave
Oh wow need I say more? Customary goal per game Sanchez again
Indescribable sadness from leaving the favorite uncle, aunt and beautiful nephews in Perth. Alone again 😢
மின்னல் ஒரு கோடி எந்தன் உயிர் தேடி வந்ததே.. 🎵🎵

So Ed Sheeran did a soulful track for Sons of Anarchy this week. That track, complemented by the closing montage, hauntingly beautiful. #SOA
What a game Melbourne Victory vs. Adelaide United. 3-2 and it's only 40mins in!
Seriously Alexis.. You goddamn hero!
#NoSanogoNoParty !!
Massively sunburnt from yesterday. I need a freaking kool-aid
The level of tiredness I possess, you can't even comprehend
Yea, like if my bed would stop feeling like a freaking Foreman grill, that'd be great.
The scene between Tig and Venus on last week's Sons of Anarchy..... POETIC #SonsOfAnarchy #SAMCRO
The Queensland Police Service liked my video on insta, so should I be worried? I am innocent 😢 @QPSmedia
But you won't engage with the thousands of your country citizens living,studying in this foreign land will ya?Too elitist for us eh? Pffft!
So yea invitee PM of my birth country, Obama gave a speech for us. So did Indian PM, so did Turkish PM, so did almost every other minister..
Struggling to keep myself awake for the Arsenal game at 2. Thanks, exceptional time zone 😒😒

Beautiful Saturday weather today.. Better be as such after my exams or I will release hell
Strangely addicted to Beauty &amp; the geek Australia.. and I don't even like reality shows.
Microwave food, too cold.. Microwave again, sizzling hot. Seriously? 😒
btw, True story bro..
Such heavy separation and history, the weight of their troubled past, heartbreaking
It highlights the work of British social worker Margaret Humphreys and her struggles to trace and reunite the now grown kids in the 80s
The toils the kids went through in missionaries doing child labor and often abused physically &amp; sexually by parish guardians.
It's abt the forced child migration scheme from UK to Australia &amp; Canada which separated underprivileged British children from their parents
Oranges and Sunshine.. What a sad movie it has made me sad 😢
Pathetic refereeing.. Clear offside on Anderlecht's first goal. Fucking refs
As is Andrea Pirlo.. Like fine wine
Fuck la Sanchez! Unstoppable!! http://t.co/ZcSlW6bvTL
Where there's Smoak, there's fire.. A fire burning like a deep desire for more for Felicity ❤❤❤❤
There ain't no Smoak, like Felicity Smoak ❤❤❤❤ #arrow #theflash

My god, Alexis.. You are something else..
Why is this fucking essay like never-ending?!
Why do some Australians call asylum seekers 'boat people'? Did their ancestors arrive in Gulfstream jets? #jokeoftheday #bantz  #grabsmycoat
So is Diggle now going to call his daughter..........Diglett?? #Arrow #JohnDiggle #questionoftheseason
Could be Turtle Man too y'know? #TheFlash
Since supervillians are generally the opposite of superheroes, I'm assuming that The Flash's archnemesis is the Sloth Man. #TheFlash
My uncle was struck by lightning like The Flash.You think it'd give you superpowers,but now he just masturbates in movie theatres.#TheFlash
Fux I is falling asleep while reading journals.. Why can't I fall asleep at night times?!
Yet another long term Arsenal injury. Da faq is goin on here?!
