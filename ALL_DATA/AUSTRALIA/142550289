“Everybody needs a hobby.”

“What’s yours?”

“Resurrection.”
I've made my beard look all fancy
Last day of harvest today. One more step closer to freedom, and the welcoming embrace of Sydney life.
Been having a Fall Out Boy kind of day. I'm sure @Em_Lou_ would approve. 🎶🎶🎶
The Chinese guy in the house calls me Rooney. I hope its because of my exploits during 5-a-side. Not because he thinks I look like Shrek
Its very hard to not hate everyone when I'm this tired. 5am wake ups are the worst.
Its just occurred to me, the one ring, from Lord of the Rings is a horcrux. Basically.

Fellaini and Mata. #DavidMoyesIsAFootballGenius
Waking up at 4.30am is no fun. But seeing the Utd v City score has banished my morning grumpiness 😄❤️
Received so much love for the beard lately
I hadn't listened to Oasis in a long time, until last night, and now I've completely re-fallen in love with that music. ❤️🎶🎸
Just cracked my back so much it was heavenly!
Went to a party. The highlight of which was when I changed a tyre. #animal
10 degrees. Its 10 degrees here. Australia is playing a very mean trick on me.
That which we are; one equal temper of heroic hearts made weak by time &amp; fate, but strong in will to strive, to seek to find, &amp; not to yield
I watched Blood Diamond for research and practice brewww https://t.co/F8g6mjLxIy
Die Another Day. The only terrible Bond film. Madonna does the tune. And appears in the film. Need I say more?
And I looked and behold: a pale horse. And his name that sat on him, was Death. And Hell followed with him. #themancomesaround
Today, I scored what I think is my first EVER header. And it was beautiful. Made up for the awful misses I made with my feet today.
People have really pissed me off today. Thankfully, they are people I never have to see again.
Guilty pleasure. Taylor Swift. And her music. Not ashamed.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen is an excellent film. Go watch it. Go read the book.
Ginny Weasley would totally get it.
The night sky right now is nothing short of breathtaking. Unbelievable.
Deciding to watch every Harry Potter film in order, was absolutely my best decision this week. #uptohalfbloodprince #snapesnapeseverussnape
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.
I dreamt of hurricanes
Its been 11 weeks since I last shaved. And also 11 weeks since I last saw the Coy's. Awful. Just awful. @brontecoy @ClaudiaCoy
I just learnt my 3rd card trick. People of Sydney, prepare to be amazed...and then thoroughly disappointed...
It's April. Which means I can finally say 'I am going back to Sydney next month, this regional nonsense is almost done!'
After wowing people with the only two card tricks I know at the weekend, I've decided to become a street magician.
Rhys-tlemania
I'm up to 21 bites. Dafuq.
Just seen Orton's RKO on Rollins. Wow. No other words.
Strike that, 19 bites.
Last night I suffered 17 separate mosquito bites. 17!!! Why the fuck am I so tasty!!??!
Just saw a video from my first year at camp, had the sudden urge to go back. What a great summer.
Well that was disappointing
A night of drinks with old housemates has lead to a few dirty pints, put away like I never left uni. Repeating on me though. Repeating.
Quality nap
You are a kite, dancing in a hurricane #SPECTRE
Whilst you're sleeping alone my dear, I'll be sleeping inside your fears
Jeremy 💔 😫
As if Lil Chris has died. :/
A pretty face, but the chase ain't worth the prize.
Gerrard apologising to his team and his fans, so much class. Wait, did he apologise to Herrera? The guy he stamped on? No? NO CLASS. #ysb
Contagious chemistry
Is 38 seconds on the field before being red carded a record? Brilliant! Slippy G strikes again. #YSB
Since when was @TobyEvans89 in Enemy of the State? @LegendCarver @Can_Drowley @lapstar_art @JayLushOgier http://t.co/BYChpu28bX
Took a football straight to the face today. My beard appears to have taken most of the impact. Portable chin protection AND Pillow!
God I love Jennifer Aniston. So much. 😍❤️
I missed one hell of a final day in the 6nations. Just like I'm missing every cool thing ever whilst in the middle of goddamn nowhere! 😡
Last night was like an united nations of beer drinking, 2 people from Hong Kong, 2 Koreans, 2 Germans, 2 Brits, 1 Yank &amp; 1 little Frenchman
I'll just rest my eyes for a moment. Boom, two hours later, I'm waking up from a nap.
The moustache song from 'A million ways to die in the west' is just pure amazing. Even if @crummett_becca doesn't like it.
The Tongan priest at work today told me I walk in the valley of death. Which was nice of him. Not ominous at all.
Watched No country for old men last night. Was disappointed. Not as good as it was hyped up to be
After all this is over, I'm never going to want to see grapes, or almonds ever again. #farmlifeproblems
Discovered the Korean girl in this house has 3 seasons of Adventure Time on her hard drive... http://t.co/7GKoLGTee4
Can you hear...can you hear that thunder?!
I've been roped into playing basketball tomorrow. A sport in which I have utterly ZERO ability in. This will not end well. I guarantee it.
Robert Downey Jr. is just all class isn't he. Pure class.
Insanity got me back in shape, but @DDPYoga is keeping me in shape. The sooner I'm back in Sydney the sooner I can get back to it! 💪
If I still lived in Leicester, I'd 100% be spending this Friday night watching @stevie_jones at the Black Horse on Braunstone Gate!
Remi is watching Up for the first time. I've told him if he doesn't cry then he has no soul. He's ginger, so its already decided.
Did I just do the Carlton dance, complete with Tom Jones playing, with my french roommate?

I may have done.
Not a criminal lawyer, a criminal, lawyer.
'You hit like a vegetarian' is my new favourite insult. Thanks @Schwarzenegger
Sat by the Murray River, with beers, a fire to cook with, enough lamb to sink a ship with, and people from all over the world.
Its 17 degrees right now. 17?! What the hell Australia. I'm going to have to put a hoody on, I'm smuggling peanuts!
I'm not shaving off this beard until I see the episode of the walking dead where Rick shaves off his. Which will be in May.
What should we do next? Something good? Something bad? Bit of both?
Payday = Yayday
Got to be dropping kilos out here. Sweat  and move, sweat, and move.
Foster the People's 'Torches' album is still one of the best albums I've ever heard
A shooting star on the walk to work. 🌠
Its March. I'm out of here in May. Hell yes.
My hoodie drawstring just fell in my brew. What is going on with my life.
Missed All Time Low in Sydney as well today. Why is everything happening whilst I'm not there!!!
Ronda Rousey is sexy and scary at the same time
Its bloody cold today. When I say cold, I mean 21 degrees. Which compared to the 40+ degree temps of last week, is cold.
Although I've just checked my accumulator, and West Ham have screwed me out of $330. #fuming
I've woken up to good results in the sport for once! Wales and Utd win. 😄
I may impair your ability to operate machinery.
Thank you @Phil_hvh 
My brother, there when I need him the most.
I hate this place
No need for introductions. I've read about girls like you on the back of toilet doors.
Definitely calling the acoustic album 'Reezus walks' 

Definitely going to get slapped with a lawsuit from Kanye West afterwards
Surfing. Football. Beaches. A clean apartment. A washing machine that works. These are all only two months away. Just. Keep. Swimming.
Live long and prosper. An idea that everyone can get behind. 

Thanks Leonard. Now boldly go, on the next big adventure. #RIPLeonardNimoy
Do you know what you should never do. Have tiger balm residue on your fingers, and absent mind-idly adjust your balls. #onfire
65 more days in the outback. 65 more days of beard growth. 65 more days and @SJR_20 can buy me a beer and tell me the nightmare is over
The line ups for Slam Dunk and Download are making me wish I was back home. 😭
I just spent the last half hour in squeezed into the back of a pickup, between a beast of a Tongan, and a monster of a Kiwi. #ifeelsosmall
That Power Rangers 'deboot' fan film is absolutely amazing.
So Gary just shaved, and Paul and Chris have both just shaved their heads. Suddenly, I feel vulnerable. #pleasenotthebeard
Reezus walks...
Not only have I missed the surf open at Manly, but Tony Hawk's in Sydney and I've missed it by being out in the middle of fucking nowhere 😡
Less Henry Jones Jr, more Allan Quatermain right now
You merely adopted the dark...
The outback. Not as cool as you'd think.
The powers gone out, so the air con is off. Its 43 bloody degrees and the sweat is dripping off my beard.
Spiders, scorpions and 40 degree heat on the daily here http://t.co/9zWDYNSNL6
I am alive
I'm in the outback. See you in 3 months.
I'm currently here. I'm pretty much the only thing here. http://t.co/UrfWmAG8V7
Just facetimed my mum and dog. Arrrrghhh I miss my dog 😭😭😭

I miss my mum too obviously.
So in the Jurassic World movie Chris Pratt has a Raptor army. 

I can't think of a word to describe the happiness and excitement I feel.
Go Patriots! http://t.co/7hzUkxfvXg
Call that a fight? Take off the helmets and pads boys.
Unbelievable
Can the crowd even see those fireworks?
Suddenly Missy Elliot is relevant again. I'm ok with that. #getyourfreakon
I think @kalleighnorval's dream job just showed up. Dancing sharks.
That Budweiser advert though...
SUPER. BOWL.
FALCAOOOOOOOO ❤️❤️❤️
Robin ❤️ #mufc
I'm don't fear spiders, but its very unsettling when walking home in the dark, to see one as big as your hand just hanging in front of you
Been here a month now without visiting Bondi. Well that has just changed.
The Big Bash final is unbelievable. #BBL04Final #BBL04 @BigBashLeague
If you get the chance, go see Birdman. Its amazing.
A horrific realisation, I'll miss the entire 6 Nations due to being out in the sticks from next week until May. 😭😭😭
Don't hold your breath, I'm not losing sleep over you.
Its Australia Day. STRAYYAA
Unbelievable shot from @KP24 #BigFinals @StarsBBL @BigBashLeague
Sydney festival with @SJR_20 
Its free, there is beer, there is food! We didn't co-ordinate outfits though http://t.co/9W31ti7TYS
Today was a yoga rest day. But it was not an Insanity rest day. 💪💪💪💪
