#IDontSleepEnoughBecause I have a sleep disorder and am doomed to forever be too poor to afford the silence I need.  *cries* please shut up
This working holiday has pretty much just ended here and now. Critical job didn‚Äôt exist, I can‚Äôt take pictures. Guess I go back to Hell?
Plus I was supposed to be shooting someone‚Äôs gig on Saturday.  Nope!  Not now!!!  I don‚Äôt have $1200 to stick something else on my camera.
$5000 nonrefundable photo workshop with a pro, and I have no lenses.  Kill me now.  Stupid hobby.  Why couldn‚Äôt I get into something useful.
I'm dancing around because my last $1 into a pokie gave me bus fare back, and my friend is walking out with an extra $700.  Jerk üòÄ
Don't tell my friend, but Dizzy is coming with me when I leave. http://t.co/WnWjfMP0Mo
Someone attacked a good friend, so I attacked her poor spelling and grammar.

I miss the days when @deviantART had an obvious ‚Äúbuy this print‚Äù button under the art, rather than off at the side where nobody sees it.

If you please, draw me a sheep!
She's at it again!  And I was blocked by someone I've never even spoken to.  Wow.
This is what it's like to be alive and accepted, and I was miserable even before I had the comparison.  Maybe this was all a mistake...
Anti-cap logic: replying to yourself from a blatantly obvious alternate account strengthens your pseudoscience-based argument.
Get harassed and spammed by anti-caps, finally reply (civilly), get blocked.  All in a day's work or something.
I may not be close with the surviving members of my family, but I have some of the best friends I could ask for.  Quality, not quantity.

Interesting how anti-caps call pros bullies for supporting zoos, yet join together bullying/namecalling, while pros join together against it

Band is loaded, chronically sleep-deprived body is imploding, thank god my friend has a mattress in the back of his truck.  Night all.
I #StandWithSeaWorld because visiting zoological facilities w. a focus on conservation as a child inspired me to rescue wildlife as an adult
I #StandWithSeaWorld bc they and other reputable zoological facilities inspire future conservationists in an increasingly disconnected world
My first night back in civilisation and I'm going to a small concert with friends. *sips good coffee* *soaks up the indoor heating* ahh..!‚ò∫Ô∏è

Leaving Tasmania just keeps getting better.  While packing I found both alcohol AND a pistachio pomegranate chocolate bar!
After the past 6 weeks I will never stop hating Tasmania. Nikon and Tamron aren't in my good books either. Steve Parish workshop, no more?
Oh don‚Äôt look at me like YOU‚ÄôVE never disappeared into your bedroom with a jar of Nutella and several bananas.
