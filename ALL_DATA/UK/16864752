So lovely at this late hour to see that lingering glow in the far distant west. The promise of long summer nights. üòä

Sahwira is looking the part now! She is raring to head off on the journey. Thanks to @ArtandSea1 &amp; @Sea_Kayak_Scot http://t.co/kdeGz1jwSA
Leonie of @ArtandSea1 expertly placing the promotional art work she designed for my kayak. What a great job! http://t.co/nrr2bU1j0b
Just what is needed - sunshine. Here in Oban to get my kayak spruced up. #2015in2015 http://t.co/D6zmAC4P6T
Hoping for dry weather today. I am having my kayak decked out in her new livery by @ArtandSea1 - this is a big moment. #2015in2015
I think I'm a technological dunce. Struggling here to interface my new Garmin with my digital mapping. Nothing happening. #frustrated
I think this is brilliant. What a great idea - though I probably wouldn't take a selfie every single mile!

G'day cobbers. Got my sunscreen for my kayaking journey. I'm not taking any chances with this summer's heatwave. üòÇ http://t.co/OvmAfes5dp
It's a damp old day here in Oban. Apparently it's the heavens way of washing the coos. üòä http://t.co/mGdMmYSvsq

There is not one centimetre of the Scottish coastline that I am not looking forward to paddling along. #2015in2015 http://t.co/xa0IZiaIPJ
I went kayaking this afternoon &amp; caught this lovely rainbow over my kayak when I was tidying things away #seakayaking http://t.co/uREOaZRJCO
It's going to be a morning of Monkeys' Weddings. That makes it feel a little more cheerful. #sunshineandrain
Whew! It's wild &amp; wet out there. **note to self: even though it's a short walk, put waterproofs on. #soaked
Do I really I have to take the ship's dog for a walk? It's wild out there tonight. üòÅ
