Brain is totally fried.

Feeling anxious tonight.
Just made smoothies for me and @Ritchie_Crypts, strawberry, banana, oats, 1% fat milk and loads of crushed ice... Mmmm! :)

Hoping I can get a couple of days off in May so me and @Ritchie_Crypts can go and see While She Sleeps :)
Slept for at least 10 hours but still feel like I haven't slept, why? :(
Cannot wait to go to bed tonight.
May have placed a @superdrug order so big I've ended up with 5 free make up bags, one for each 3 for 2 offers, whoops! :P
So tired, me and early mornings do not go well together haha.
The Coachella line up is such a mixed bag of artists, would love to be there... Especially for AC/DC of course! :)
I normally hate summer but for some reason, I'm looking quite forward to it this year.
Last day of my time off work, start work at 6am tomorrow so I got up at 8.45 this morning to make sure I'm tired enough to sleep early :(
Saturday night, house to ourselves and Ritchie is bedded at 9.45 haha.

Bought some new drugstore bits, including all of the @CollectionLove nude palettes, they look amazing!
Lost the last silver ball I had for my helix piercing, should really nip to the tattoo shop today and get more, so many tattoo temptations!

Its been so good to spend the last couple of hours having a good chat with @Ritchie_Crypts , I love him loads
Spending time with @booitsme_austin tomorrow :)
Away to tackle the linen cupboard, think I must be crazy.
Another four @GerardCosmetics lipsticks ordered, they really are such creamy, pigmented and long wearing :)
Upgrading to BT infinity in a couple of weeks finally, it'll be nice to have a decent broadband speed!

Just wrote two new blog posts, super excited about one of them in particular :)
Just reshaped and plucked my brows, never fails to amaze me how fast they grow.
My neighbours are so inconsiderate, their kids may be on holiday but people in this house still have to get up early for work, shut up!

Just finished an 8 hour shift and I've come home in a good mood and not even feeling too tired!
Not looking forward to starting work at 6am... Oh well, off to bed I go I suppose!
Beauty and curves : March Favourites http://t.co/jpMCB0YHNt
Cannot wait to be on holiday for a week next week.
Wondering if the old woman sitting across from me on this train is getting a good enough look at me, how rude.
It was so good to see Josie, just wish I'd made plans to meet all of the college bunch!
Pretty certain my phone will die before I even get on the train :(
Coming to Aberdeen for the day always makes me realise how much I hate this place.
Can't wait to get home, bed is calling me.
Just waiting for a train home, so tired :( #starbucks #tired #mua #masterclass https://t.co/A0MMOyjPAr
Hopefully going to get a chance to see one of my college friends since I'm here in Aberdeen, I miss them all so much! :(
Seriously cannot get over how heavy the new @whileshesleeps album is!
Bought new while she sleeps, amorettes and we are harlot albums to hopefully calm my anxiety on the train today.
Going to Aberdeen today and the x factor auditions are being held in union square, mum is determined to get me to audition.
Super excited for my second @GlamCandyUK masterclass tomorrow! :)
Oh yes, steak, homemade chips, onion rings and a kopoerberg! #steak #kopperberg #cider #food #yum https://t.co/uZKXB9ZP9I
Currently have half a jar of mayo on my hair... This better make my hair look nice!
Off work for three days now! :D

OK so I've only had 2 cups of coffee but I've not had in ages and now I have serious coffee shakes, fuck sake haha.
Cheers to the asshole who tweeted about who A is....

Can't believe it's only 20 past 12 and I've already done all of the house work, chilled for ages and had a bath!
Currently watching @FleurDeForce on this morning, she looks amazing! Such a proud moment aha! :)
Using the "fizzbanger" from lush in my bath today, smells amazing but turning my bath to this, not sure how I feel ha http://t.co/8vt8scWrIq
My cats are so lazy, I'm jealous.
Might actually die a little inside if someone on my timeline says who A is tonight... I'm only on season 3 of PLL!
Cold but want ice cream... Oh the struggle.
Thinking about selling my Nars sheer matte foundation with a pump in the shade Gobi for Â£24, anyone interested? Barely used!

Serious gig withdrawal syndrome after seeing @BlackStarRiders earlier this month! @DamonJOfficial @rickywarwick
I say this because I can currently hear a Gary Moore concert on TV downstairs :)
Living in a house with people who all like rock and metal music is great, never moment where you wish they would turn their music off.
Congratulations @whileshesleeps , another heavy as fuck album! Honestly don't they've ever released anything I didn't love!
Sad to see that the @ELFCosmeticsUK website is closing down, had to place one final order for old times sake!
My knee is so sore today, its never really got better since I fell about a month and a half ago. :(

I wish @ABHcosmetics would bring their liquid lipsticks to the UK, dying to get my hands on them!
So sad to hear that AJ Pero from Twisted Sister has passed away, thoughts go out to the family at such a difficult time.
Got some blogging done finally, spending all of Monday or Tuesday when I'm off doing the same.

Beyond done with today and it's only 8.50am.
Finally managed order the Anastasia contour kit from @cultbeauty :)
Made the nicest chicken stir fry ever when I got home from work, can't wait to go for a good long sleep before tomorrow's shift though.
Not going to have a single bit of energy left in me by this time next week.
Away to have krave cereal with a big blob of nutella on top, so unhealthy yet so good.

Bought mum YSL black opium yesterday and bless how happy she is with it,she  insisted I took the wee makeup bag it came with :3
Starting to detest mac foundations, I can't get any of them to look right on my skin, with or without primer.

Such a good day in Inverness and I get to see @booitsme_austin tomorrow, really making the most of my rare days off haha!
Had a really good make up junkie style chat with the girl at @UrbanDecay in Inverness today, such a nice girl :)
Starbucks is my favourite #starbucks #coffee #mocha https://t.co/3Wc74lJZf9
Just got the nicest coat in h&amp;m, I love shopping in Inverness.
Looking forward to a day out in Inverness tomorrow :)
Why are people slating Kim K's hair so much? I think it looks fab.
So tired, going to spend the rest of the afternoon in bed, watching PLL.
Aw bless, my cats got up with me this morning, no doubt they'll go back to bed when I leave aha.
It should be illegal having to be up this early for work haha.
Thought it was pretty good that I'm only working for three hours tonight... Until I realised that I'm in at 6am tomorrow until 2pm.
I post a new blog every Thursday! :) Beauty and curves : February Favourites http://t.co/Bos4Wxr9cs
Just placed my second @GerardCosmetics order using the '2lips' discount which is amazing, I love their lipsticks!
I rated @BlackStarRiders at O2 ABC Glasgow â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… via Bandsintown http://t.co/Wc4UC0lrih
Looking forward to an evening with @Ritchie_Crypts consisting of pizza, the voice and movies :)
Feeling so chilled being back home, in comfy clothes and catching up on YouTube videos.

Bus has broken down in Cumbernauld, most likely going to miss our transfer in Perth and there are screaming children, I'm in hell.
blackstarriders were incredible as always last night! #blackstarriders #damonjohnson #guitarâ€¦ https://t.co/iJDZ4tV9RK
The weather down here in Glasgow is atrocious, glad we're not outside in it anymore.
Trust me to get too hot, my knee to give way and me to pass out in the middle of the o2 ABC 3 songs before the end of Europe's set...
Currently in Stirling, I love this place, need to pay another proper visit to it soon.
I'm going to @BlackStarRiders at O2 ABC Glasgow in Glasgow, United Kingdom - Mar 6 http://t.co/Ny2WmiyR9v
Off to glasgow to see blackstarriders and Europe :) #blackstarriders #europe #gig #rock #guitarsâ€¦ https://t.co/O56kf1lGJj

Kinda nervous about going back to work, I hope my knee copes with it.
I would always put an animal before myself, I just wish some people weren't so cruel.
Just got so emotional at the thought of people giving up their pets because they don't want them, officially a @CatsProtection sponsor now.

Wearing Fendi perfume and feeling fab.
Just found a brand new pair of jeans in my wardrobe I hadn't even tried on... I think they might be my new favourites.
It just took me 45 minutes to pluck my eyebrows, they were horrific.
This time next week I'll be in Glasgow, waiting to see @BlackStarRiders :)

Constantly listening to @wearedangerkids , need to see them again!
People are shitebags.
If that wasn't on purpose she must have really hurt her arse, poor quine.
Did she mean to fall? Omg.
You can't compete with Foo Fighters, fuck off with the five seconds of summer pish haha.
Yaass the Foos!!
Kim K is way too fab for Kayne. That ass.
What's the point in Kanye West even "singing"? Its constantly being muted, hardly appropriate for the Brits.
#EdSheeranBrit :)
I must admit, the Download line up looks pretty awesome... Not so much the headliners but mainly the second stage.
Been signed off of work for another week but determined to be up at a decent time, need to stick to my work routine.
Three new yankee candles ordered, can't stand not having one burning in the bedroom.
I can't believe @CharlotteTMusic didn't get a place on the voice, she has such an incredible voice and she's so pretty!
I need out of this fucking place, feel like fucking piggy in the middle with all this shit.
Cannot wait to see @booitsme_austin tomorrow :)
Spent all afternoon cleaning our room, my knee is in agony but it was so worth it :)
Snuff- Slipknot will always be one of my favourite songs.
Its really sad to hear that Bruce Dickinson has been battling cancer, here's hoping the doctors are right and he'll have recovered soon.
Just ordered @Jaclynhill 's 1995 and buttercup, never been so excited about lipsticks before!
Changed up my account a bit, seems to only ever happen once in a blue moon.
Actually obsessed with Pretty Little Liars and I'm only on season one, episode four.
From Glasgow before seeing Crown The Empire, I liked how my hair looked aha #crowntheempireâ€¦ http://t.co/27fPOemeFL
Me and @Ritchie_Crypts don't really celebrate valentines day so we're going to watch the voice, drink cider and eat my homemade curry :)
Pretty organised, ordering mum's mothers day presents when I get paid, already know exactly what I'm giving her :)
