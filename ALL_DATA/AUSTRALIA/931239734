it was actually jack de belin's proper tackle style that caused the high tackle.
Geeez @TheBlock9 could be a much better show without challenges and that knob Keith
Tyson Frizzel out for 2 games is a joke. Never had a judiciary charge in his life and was a complete accident where the guy fell! #mediahype

Right down the outside Impulsive Spirit! what a win great call @hkdarren #trialledwell #bang
Ikin "Broncos have caught everyone by surprise" well not exactly. I had them as one of only 3 clubs to win the premiership
I agree with Matty Johns a lot of the time but sometimes he says some things that are just so dumb
that was the worst call I've seen all year #refsincrisis
Peter showed today why he should be in the first grade side for good!! @WallyFrogmore @jDARNELL96

Euan Aitken = Dragons next Matt Cooper
well they won't be throwing any bottles today... the fans are leaving üòù
wtf that was the worst penalty I've seen all season
I'm worried about nsw origin and their halves. no nsw half deserves a jersey this year apart from Reynolds (injured). their all playing shit
Saint Benji
Mitch rein is always good for a couple of errors üò°üî´
omg Farrell I don't think it's that hard to put the ball down then!!!
if L'estrange plays another shit game today he should be dropped
sooooo my taxi driver is going 55-60km/h on a 80km/h road. #cunts
panthers medical bill would be quite expensive

Eels are playing so bad yet again
Grand Marshall isn't even group 3 class.
Grand Marshal jumped out of the ground!!!! what the actual

Sadler's Lake to kick off Joao Moreira's day
$21-$1.7 La Dolce Vita.... only in qld

r7 Catkins
r8 Hartnell
r9 Adelaide/ Criterion
r10 Avoid Lightning

Flemington

So there's jockeys rating the Randwick track a soft 6 but the track managers saying its a heavy 8? can these guys do anything right? no
I reckon laurie daley would have put a line through both Pearce and maloneys names for origin tonight
4 players scored more points then Gallen in his own team this week #rare
thanks Gallen 55 pts
