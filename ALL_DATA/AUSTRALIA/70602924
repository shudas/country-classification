"@Batman5273: Here's a recap of the @katyperry #SuperBowl halftime show in case you missed it. http://t.co/kinBLtczHn"
Start of the 4th set Djoker can't stand on his own 2 legs and is down 2-0. Wins 11 of the next 12 games and serves for the match #AusOpen
Those last 2 games were some of the best tennis I've ever seen #AusOpen
The ebbs and flows in momentum in this match have been fascinating #AusOpen
"@anoncitizenhere: The #bbc can fuck off with it's focusing on lip-reading swearing then complaining about the swearing!! #cunts #AusOpen"
Outstanding first set so far ... drama, service breaks galore &amp; a tiebreak coming I suspect #ausopen

Murray giving Berdych a tennis lesson here #AusOpen
Stanovic 3 ???   Please... #AusOpen
"@adamliaw: Murray 'SCOT this in the bag. Could be CZECH-mate for Berdych?

I am so sorry. 

#AusOpen"
Berdych is an excellent player but only has the one game plan. Just hit it hard and deep. Murray has a few more strings to his bow #AusOpen
Can't see Berdych getting up if he loses this TB #AusOpen
What chance Andy Murray's mum will smile at his fiance ... before his career winds up?

#DETvsDAL Am I seeing cracks in the Cowboy's much vaunted young O - Line?
#DETvsDAL Fabulous block by Tate!
#DETvsDAL Detroit's underrated defence getting the job done against the Dallas running game thus far
#CINvsIND The @Bengals offence has been completely impotent this half
#CINvsIND Lesson learnt .... Never put money on @Bengals in a playoff game
#CINvsIND Unless the @Bengals can get some genuine consistent pressure on @ColtsA_Luck12 they're going to lose this one
#CINvsIND Hilton's dropped catches have been very costly in this first half
Has anyone else in Australia listened to Sara Koenigs' #TheSerial?
Most disappointed to see there's no equivalent to #monopolySydneyedition running tonight.  I'm open to suggestions everyone ....
#GameDecider DET's outstanding run defence against DeMarco Murray &amp; a very good DAL Offensive line #NFLPlayoffs
#PITvsBAL 2 evenly matched teams in physical game #PlayoffFootball 
Loving it!
#AZvsCAR The only thing worse than Arizona's offence in this game is their punting
