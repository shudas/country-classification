Its so sad how much one person can damage/hurt someone
So in love with kirstys brother it actually hurts
Can't put my phone down for 10 mins without coming back to 200 unread messages from the group chat
Used to HATE sleeping alone but now I couldn't imagine having to share a be all the time
Leaving school 100% makes you realise who your friends are
Actually dying at jack in the group chat
Waking up to drunk snaps from people makes me glad I wasn't out last night
Making kirsty steak for tea cause im the best friend ever
If I was a donkey I'd be a really funny donkey #watchoutdonkeys
Don't know why I read things that I know fine are going to upset me
No idea how I'm not asleep considering me and Kirsty went on a 10 mile cycle today
Taking your make up off when you are tired has to be the worst thing ever
Honestly think salt is fucking minging yet everyone else seems to love it
What a fucking mort I am
Usual nic from me again
Way to much on my mind tonight, wish sleep was a option
