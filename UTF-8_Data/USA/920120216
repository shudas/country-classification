*looks at math test*
*cries*
I swear every night around midnight I magically turn into an emotional wreck
ugh my heart
In desperate need of coffee
Today has been mostly awful and it's not even noon yet :/
I'm approximately .5 seconds away from getting in my car and leaving school and never returning ever again
Always wishing I was prettier and smarter and nicer and funnier
kill me
Get your goddamn roller backpack outta here
Shaming girls for wearing a lot of makeup is so dumb
I'm so unbelievably impatient
How to win my heart http://t.co/1JUFoKTDoH
I don't know you so pls don't call me shorty ://
Nothin wrong with a little retail therapy

Such a sad sight http://t.co/uFDMb8yR0k
I took approximately 3 naps today so guess who's not sleepin tonight 😄😄😃
Life is treating me so good right now and honestly I'm so scared I'm gonna do something to fuck it up
Ya know how it goes @bitchin_bek @bekkahsbitch http://t.co/HtpW79JycM
This weekend was a good one @ Seattle, Washington https://t.co/gSiyJlkdav
Walking through Pikes Place and I'm like what even are all of these languages that people are speaking
Beccs woke me up while I was having the greatest dream OF MY LIFE :/
Seattle is so pretty, I love it 💘💘
I was planning on going to bed like 2 hours ago whooooops
I act on impulse so often and one of these days it's gonna bite me in the ass
Kinda over it kinda still wanna murder you
I'm literally going on a 3 day trip and I've probably got enough clothing packed to last a week
Tip: don't be a fuckboy
I'm wearing a backwards hat and I feel like such a faggot
Still can't decide if I'm excited for this trip to Seattle this weekend or not
It is 1 in the morning so STOP being a little bitch and let me sleep in peace OK?????
My emotions right now are disgusting
Do I need to eat this whole box of candy? No. Am I going to? Probably.
found the memory card from my trip to Washington DC 2 years ago and thought this was kinda cool https://t.co/wamKoxeGUZ
Fuckboys be like http://t.co/elYtqjQsGJ
Everyone is talking about the new emojis and I'm like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRETTY LADY 🎉🎊 Here's a couple throwbacks to enjoy 😂😘❤ @CrisnaE http://t.co/0NbS7buXXH
The closest thing I've had to real food today were a few mozzarella sticks and I think that sums up my eating habits pretty well
Let's be honest, I'm probably addicted to ice cream
There are some really pretty girls in the world and I really hate it
It took Hannah 5 years to pick out 5 pairs of underwear that no one's gonna see anyways 😂
*Sabrina walks in* "guys my sweatshirt smells like butter, smell it"
😂😂 whaaaaaat
The real question is why is Bek on my bed while I'm on the floor
*asks mom if I can go to Dutch*
Mom: you need a job 

... def wasn't related to the question but 🆗
New phone so text me with your naaame 😜
I just need a cute boy to bring me coffee, is that too much to ask for?????

#transformation 😂😂 @hannahfoster319 http://t.co/K5apdHUlby
Do you know whats in Amboy? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
mom last week: you dont even need to have a phone its not necessary
mom today: wtf Hannah youre not allowed to go anywhere without a phone
my mom legit just spilled nail polish all over my bedroom floor what even
I rlly wish my phone would charge because I'm tired of carrying around a dead brick
My mom may be crazy af but I love my step dad so much and I am beyond grateful for him
twitter on a computer is weird af
Watching 12 year olds play baseball gives me so much anxiety

Nothing warms my heart more than hearing the baseball boys call eachother babe

HAPPY BIRTHDAY @lauren_barrese 🎉 hope it was as fabulous as you 💓
Guys 4 more days we can do this
I spend too much time on Twitter
Wow I love when people don't stop at stop signs!!!!!
this sux
It's almost 2am and the only thing that's on my mind is the fact that I am upstairs and the ice cream is downstairs
Being single is great and all but I have to admit it does get a little bit lonely
Do you ever pre-decide what days you're allowed to go get coffee because I do that all the time
