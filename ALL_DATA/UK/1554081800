The Lord Ashcroft Poll showing that 71% of 16-17 year-olds voted yes. They only asked 14 people..... http://t.co/BYoM26k5SR
We've either missed an amazing opportunity or avoided a complete disaster but what matters is that Scots got what they voted for
I'm so proud to be a part of such a politically aware nation. No matter what the result we have already outdone ourselves #indyref
A great outcome for tonight would be if America could recognise that England is not the same as the UK
I've really enjoyed Twitter being all political. It's been far better than all the bitching and dross that you usually get
Feels pretty good to exercise my legal rights. Should be allowed to do it more often
Only 50% of people are voting yes not 100% as Twitter seems to suggest tonight
The difference between this vote any that has gone before is that the result will actually count for something in Scotland
Never been more worried about an X in my life
He also said that the Bedroom Tax was a great policy and that nobody in England really cares whether Scotland get independance or not
Nearly got into an argument with a customer today cause he said that Thatcher and the Poll Tax were the best thing to happen to this country

Peewit standing on a chair in the middle of the Cheify shouting AGAIN at the top of his voice is definitely a highlight of my life so far
Might have to vote yes because Alistair Darling spells his name wrong
Not going to lie. I'm almost persuaded to vote yes just because Alex Salmond is slightly less of a prick than Alistair Darling

It's High Green mate, via Hillsborough please

Leftover Chinese after work

Don't know if I'll vote yes but Salmond is clearly running the show tonight #ScotDecides
Alistair Darling is a total dickhead
Well I'm going to drink my weight in vodka at Belladrum
