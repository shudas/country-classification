The issue I have with #leunig's premise is that if you DO vaccinate, you're putting science over love. Wrong. I used science BECAUSE I love.
Sorry, #leunig has previous anti-vax form. Try as you like to justify today's cartoon as irony... but it's not. http://t.co/ANXpW0vNaE

Dapper hat tip to @Wyld for the 10% @lootcrate promo code. Just got me hero status when used to help my nephew get his 1st 3 month sub.
Except for sports and cooking shows, I now watch no traditional TV AT ALL. @Twitch, @RoosterTeeth and other shows fill my time. #Done
I know it's not something that's done here but if ever there was an occasion to declare days of national mourning, it's this. #RIPRichie

Been given the nod to fly to a meeting in Sorrento in 3 weeks. Alas, I'll be driving around Melbourne with full itinerary so no @mokargas :(
A quick (and long overdue) glance at my Foxtel plan led to a phone call and I'm now paying a 1/3 the price for the content we actually watch
Yo, Elmer Riggs, fuck you buddy. Get your apatosaurus bullshit up outta here.

Wait, did the court just order an ISP to hand over METADATA to a private company? Someone telegram the Attorney General!
Dear Paleo/organic bloggers. I don't want advice from someone who isn't a scientist, I want it from a BETTER scientist. Data &gt; Rumor/Guess

My favourite comeback of the day to homophobic hate speech on Twitter: "there are homosexuals in the lobby?! Stop the elevator!"
Yes, the Essendon FC didn't break the law... but their practises were shady as fuck.
The amount of effort it would take to be dicks to people who support Arkansas' new discrimination laws shows how much THEY love being dicks.

Racist fuckwits are racist... and fuckwits... and so easily out argued it's not worth even hanging around to do.

When your barber insists on taking a before and after photo to demonstrate his "crafting" style. #HirsuteLifestyle
My sister @michelle_author is having her book read on Playschool. ON MUTHA FUNKING PLAYSCHOOL, BITCHES. This blows my mind.
That's the problem with burning the barn over Obama's birth certificate... Ted Cruz's barn is right next door and there's still embers.
The uncomfortable truth for Tony Abbott and the ALP is a change of Prime Minister would see the LNP take the next 2 elections #auspoI
Fired up the Pixel trailer. Much HYPE... then Sandler came on and the hype halved... then Kevin James came on and I turned it off. #NoHype

MINE THE DIAMOND (Minecraft Song) [Toby Turner ft. Terabrite]: https://t.co/JRt77XoI0d (@bennybucko @MellissaD J will like this song)
Immunisation rates of Aboriginal kids is around 95%. In wealthly parts of Sydney it's about 80%. That's what I call a poor #lifestylechoice
The worst thing about #lifestylechoice is the many that will agree. Abbott will get a "racist bump" by playing off the sterotype #AusPol
The discussion about services in remote communities should occur, just not the "You need to live a more White #lifestylechoice" one. #AusPol
The google results for "soup delivery Toowoomba" are most disappointing.
As a child I didn't like lectures about cleaning my room. My room was messy and needed cleaning. We should listen to the UN #auspoI
If you buy a $14,000 v1.0 watch, good luck to you.
Couldn't make it up if you tried... The LNP hosted an International Women’s Day event at male-only club.

That Power Rangers video though.
As I sighed at this 450mb file taking 10 mins to download as opposed to 3 mins at home, my 14 yr old self with his 28.8K modem died a little
Remember kids, a "Best" Oscar is really only "as voted by 5,000 members of the Academy". Recheck the value YOU place on the AMPAS's opinion.
Tip For Dog Owners: Lock up your dogs and block their ears. Tony Abbott's speech today will be the highest pitch of whistle. #auspol
Somewhere is the world a whole bunch of people are gathered to watch people play video games in a theatre. The nerds won. #Win #LetsPlayLive
In an effort to save resources, I'm now re-categorising "ignorant assholes" and "just plain assholes" as "Fuckwits who waste resources".
My favourite type of #GamerGate'r are those who aggressively and threateningly try to bully and shout down reports of aggression and threats
Regardless of your views of David Hicks' actions, the rule of law and justice is the big picture. It should never be compromised. #AusPol
