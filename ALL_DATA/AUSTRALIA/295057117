I giggle a little bit each time I see a fence being fenced off
I hate this, train stuck in signal black spot. Oh look @JulieBishopMP here's an emoji to express my feelings right now: ðŸ˜£
thx to you @amaysimAU or @optus my last 3 tweets did not send or get saved as drafts due to poor signal infrastructure #firstworldproblems
Secret documents showing current Revesby-City Circle trains to terminate at Central, replaced with rolling stock accomodating to airport pax

Hilarious, the preceding bus service became the bus service I originally intended to transfer to @businfo #370  #CityFail
Who schedules a bus to leave from the FIRST timetabled stop 2min before the train arrives at the station?
that moment when you hit refresh or send and the signal bars disappear #fml
Just want to say thanks to amaysim today for saving my precious phone battery today, strong signals throughout journey- NOT.
