Oh and I had chocolate cake put down my crack. #cheers
Drinking Bolognese, Birthday sex ruined, getting arrested and being handed a $2 fine. It's fair to say the Tully crew hit Cairns hard.
Just listened to Avicii - Wake up me up, for the 1st time whilst sober. Argument whether Im still pissed from last night. #funfactsaboutphil

The weekend is here! Off to Cairns tomorrow to get lairy. And as places to get lairy go, cairns is up there. #goon #dancingontables
