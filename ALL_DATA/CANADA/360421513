My boyfriend won't say hi to his coworkers for me @Andrew_Will_T #bitch

Officially not sleeping in my room tonight
WHY IS THE UNIVERSE PUNISHING ME FOR STUDYING
SOS I OPENED MY NEURO TEXTBOOK AND A MASSIVE SPIDER CRAWLED OUT AND VANISHED BEHIND MY DESK
My Stats exam is in like 5 days and I'm sitting here studying for every other course w/e
While normally I try and do well in school this course is kicking my ass so getting that high on the lab exam brought my lab mark way up!
I needed to get a 15% on my lab exam to pass the lab portion of the course. I got a 53%! Woohoo!
Extremely sick but still trying to be positive
Forcing myself to get rest is the hardest thing ever with all my exams coming up #NeedToStudy #NeedToGetBetter
This is the absolute worst time to be sick like this
I feel like I'm on drugs but without any fun benefits
I have the most amazing bf in the world omg @Andrew_Will_T you da bomb üíñüòòüòç
Going to see my ex's parents tonight and it's honestly the scariest thing

Making a set of Quizlet cards for the entire NEUR 2200 semester.... I'm on lecture 4 #LongNightAhead
I wanna put on a dress &amp; a bow but all I'm doing today is studying so it would be pointless :(
Like even something so simple as being in school/not being in school
Its weird how your place in life can cause such a divide between you and those you used to be close with
Because I know I'll be asleep by the time you start, happy first day at your new job @Andrew_Will_T !!

Best news ever is finding out you get to spend half the summer in the same town as your boyfriend üíô

First two euthanasias today.. Not an easy day at work
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL TODAY IM WALKING FROM BILLINGS TO WORK IN A TSHIRT üå∏üåªüåû
I literally have a single plan this weekend that isn't studying but I think I'd have a heart attack if I had any more than that
My tea smells like Yogi Berry but tastes like Guyuasa &amp; it's really confusing for my senses
"It's yours... What do you wanna name is?" "DiGiorno. Like the pizza. Cause that's where it came from"
Perfect night of relaxation and fun to have me ready to study the next few weeks
Pizza, tea, &amp; #FindingCarter with the bestie ‚òïÔ∏èüçïüë≠
There is a woman testing out her ringtones and text tones at FULL VOLUME in this bus shelter #why #seriouslywhy
Like I'm all about being nice to people but srsly learn to read&amp; don't ask to cut people who have barely any items if you have a cartload
Seriously that's two people (the one in front of me and the one who asked to cut in front) who can't read the dang sign
*person with like 20 things in cart* "can I cut in front of you, I've been waiting in this other cash forever" *looks at my two items* "no?"
There should be a tax for people who go through the "12 items or less" lanes with way more than 12 items aka the person in front of me
A bunch of empty seats on the bus and this person decides to sit directly beside me #why

Kinda wish the boyfriend was here tho so I could stress cry on him (PS: crying is GOOD! It lets out the stress!)
The stress and tears over the next few weeks will be worth it for getting some good marks for vet school

TFW you realize you left your candles in the freezer for like 5 hours #ohshit
Bringing others down won't bring you up. Work on yourself &amp; your own goals rather than tearing down the lives of others.
Yoga always makes me exhausted yet hungry #ImSoTired #ButImSoHungry
Additionally I'm really thankful for the negative experiences I had first year cause I feel they helped shape me into a better person
Like seriously you'd be amazed at the difference that thinking positively and being more forgiving and nice can do
My new years resolution was to be a more positive, kind person &amp; it's only been 3 months and I just gotta say I'm a 1000000x happier person
Learned in neuro that apparently lefties are more likely to be gay #TheMoreYouKnow
