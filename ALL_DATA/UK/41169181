Like all I want to do is have fun but I have no confidence for this shit (there needs to be a middle finger emoji)
Almost went back to a guys place, but me being me said no âœ‹ fuck you who made me feel like shit (almost said name bit that would be bad)
Wonder if anyone will notice we all have the same hairstyle ðŸ˜‚
Off to see my nan I haven't seen in like a year ðŸ˜±
Don't know what to wear tonight omg
My leg is so itchy I just want to rip the skin off

I'm bored af
In that sort of mood where I miss cuddling in bed.
This is when I realise how many friends I don't have
What I need is a busy day at work because the boredom there is killing me
I had to serve food to director of the company and let's just say that I've never put food on tables so well for anyone in my life ðŸ˜‚
It's cloudy outside which means... Customers at work!

Wish I had my own bff like Felix from Orphan Black.
All I want to do is sleep until Sunday when I have to get up for work
If I see that cat again tonight I'll probably end up taking it home with me ðŸ˜¸
Basically falling asleep on my feet
I just checked my bank account and it almost gave me a heart attack. No more wine for me.
I have three days off next week, buzzing!
I have a day off Saturday and that's probably when the weather will be shit :(
Resigning myself to not being sent home this holidays at all
Wine is literally my BFF
Despite being bored out of my skull, work wasn't too bad today
So I went into the shop to get some dinner and came out with wine, sounds pretty good ðŸ˜‚
