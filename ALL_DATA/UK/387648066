It's really sad that @MadeinDagenham finishes tomorrow and that I only had the chance to see it once! 6months was far too short
I was so optimistic about doing work this morning and now I've given up cos maths and I just can't do it
Watching Jeremy Kyle is making me late but I can't not watch

Doing a levels has made me realize so much. How crap I am at maths, how I think I'm good at Spanish but I'm not, how I hate English Lit
I think that I wanna spend a few years living and working in New York/general America
Stop saying you've done no revision when there's pictures?

Easter is great. It's the only other time of the year where it's socially acceptable to eat chocolate for breakfast
Ridiculously hot in my room tonight
