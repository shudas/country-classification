It is scary how good @HawthornFC are! Lets just call it a day and give them the trophy! No one can compete with them! #worldclass
These umps are horrendous, shocking umpiring. How hard is it. Idiots. #AFLSaintsGiants

A report, a popped shoulder and a goal in the first minute! Love footy season! #AFLBluesTigers
Glad its over, this great game doesnt deserve any further nonesense! Lets get the footy back on! #getstuffedASADA #footyisthewinner
Cannot fathom how drunk the Aussie cricketers will be getting after that win! Would live to be partying with them! #finchywillbeblind #vics
The last 2 world cup winners have done it on home soil, England would be feeling optomistic going into the 2019 cup! #gogold #WorldChamps
This is where @JamesFaulkner44 earns his money! Just a quick 80 ofd from 40 will do thanks jim!
Jack Steven repays the faith by signing a 5 year deal, knows we are on the right track! Good man stevo! @stkildafc #strengththroughloyalty
One day cricket you can stay here forever, that was the best thing ive ever seen! #cricketisexciting #seeyouatthemcg
Gee i love seeing the English choke! Couldnt handle the pressure, head back home now boys, an embarrassment to cricket!
Glen Maxwell, not a bad cricketer...casual flick for 6 off the pads...that doesnt happen often! Cudos @Gmaxi_32
Those mighty boys in green! 3 world cups and 3 wins over a big name opposition! Never count @Irelandcricket out!
Hoping for a win by my country of birth @Irelandcricket against the Windies! Great start! Now get the win boys! #irishbybirthaussiebynature
The end to that game makes India right that technology doesnt work, no doubt the BCCI had a hand in the finish!
As much as i am a traditionalist...im not completely against a Twilight Grand Final, has be a good specatcle though. Mkw it unique though
Laura Dundovic you sicken me. Have a go you spoilt sluzz
Wow Americans really can do Half Time entertainment.. Looks awesome and always have the biggest names! #hatsoff
He may have made 77 but the blame for that loss is squarley on Moises Henriques shoulders! Take the ball ya fool! Cop that flog!
Thats 4 Semi Final losses in a row for @StarsBBL any danger of getting to a bloody final! #annoyed #bringbackwarnie
Tim Cahill you are one of the greatest human beings ever! I love you! @Tim_Cahill
There are plenty of stars in Melbourne at the moment but good god the @StarsBBL are the most exciting at the moment! Lets go all the way!!
For a bloke playing at home @NickKyrgios gets very grumpy at his own fans, just relax son and play tennis!
Poor @ShaneWarne the guy cant do anything without being talked about. Guy was on tinder, good on him. That lady that ratted him is a loser.
Kokkanakis the only Aussie who knows how to use a DRS/Hawkeye properly! Go kokka!
Kyrios and Kokkinakis definately doing it for me tonight! #goaussies
I could do without you Jim Courier...
Ahhhh England, its good to have you back in town! I missed the domination! Why do they even come here! #AUSvENG
Funny how a week can change things for @Gmaxi_32 a 60 and now 100 and people are back on him! #thebigshowisback #nevergotoffhim
Ahhh couldnt be happier that @BumbleCricket is back in town! Has the best commentary voice in the game! #getin @BigBashLeague @tensporttv
Was Cam White Cosidered for selection in the WC squad or has he been lost to Australian cricket? Cause he can hit a long ball! #AskJunior
Who else was it going to be? Had to be him! I love you Tim Cahill!!
Soccer is only good when its International soccer, this will be exciting! Clear it out for Aussie Tim! #cahillspaddock #AUSvKUW
Just a very big fan of Burnsy! Keep going son! #ishesayingburnsorboourns?
Imagine how much @ShaneWarne would turn the ball on this pitch! #AUSvIND @WWOS9 #thespinking #bringhimback
Did anyone else see Watson clap along to the "Kohlis a wanker" chant? Best thing hes done all series! Hahah
How many times has the top 6 of the batting order all got 50+ in a test match? Unheard of!! @WWOS9 #AUSvIND
"Kumar, what is that? 5 Os and 2 Us? " #AUSvIND #haroldand...
Burns bats at 3 for WI and ENG tours for mine, looks a lot more composed than watto, either drop watson or bat him at 6!
God your frusterating watto, well batted but gee that shot didnt need to be played when your on 81 chasing your first ton in 2 years!
Shane Watson-the king of making runs in a dead rubber. Make runs with the series in doubt mate! These runs mean nothing for mine...
AFL Football and Cricket are the two best sports on this planet...FACT! Not hearing anything else...
