That snapchat is 😱
😍 That moment when I figure out Cal and Daario are played by the same guy. Mmmm
Lmao I guess.
👀
I don't want to get married tbh
Is it really that strange to be with a person for over a year but not label your relationship?
Dammit late night.
😭😭 I'm so hungry why is this line so long.
Today sucks 😭
I think that's creepy.
I should charge my phone.
😫
Honestly this is the longest I've stayed fucking with somebody and it's nice.
One year :D
Why am I hungry again
-_-
ahhhhh
I honestly don't know how this happened
Every time I tell him I want something sweet and he replies "I'm right here" I just 😒😒 lmao
"I always want you to come back with me". Fuck. 😭
Fuck this physics paper 😭
Wingstop tomorrrowwwww
Idk if I should do laundry today or over the weekend. -_-
I should save the other one for Cowchella.

I think you have a problem if you think having sex lessens your self-worth.
Lmao he passed out
Wooooooowww
LMAO FUCK I NEED TO CLEAN MY PHOTOS AHSJSKCKB
😘
Daaaamn Miguel got a 57 in the midterm.
I'm gonna punch a goddamn wall.
We were literally fucking 30 minutes away from Merced and my dad turned around to get some fucking tacos what the actual fuck
I hold no expectations for my father yet he still disappoints. How can a person be so irresponsible? Is he dumb? Is he just an asshole?
I'm too lazy to pack even though I never unpacked lmao
-____-'
That scale lies. I'm pretty sure I gained 20 pounds being home. I am not 130 still.
I thought it was perfect lmao
Miguel doesn't think my pickle innuendo was very funny.
Someone hire me as a math tutor dammit.
She's doing calculussss
I see someone doing math in Panera and I just wanna go help :(
Being at home without wifi is boring as shit.
=_= Panera time again
=_= someone told me my booty was banging and then Nick proceeded to comment on the ask saying swag #boybye
It is not my responsibility to wake your grown ass up. Jfc.
Lmao first world problems basically.
Life is boring without wifi 😒
Yo his family legit believes people lived to be 900 years old back then. #what
His mom is cray -_-
...how is a woman showing her breasts comparable to murdering a baby?????? What kind of logic....
No one comes to visit me because I have no friends. :(
I don't think Atonement and tequila mix together.
:D Margaritas??
I watched Down with Love for the first time in like years. It's a lot funnier when you understand all the innuendos.
What to do what to do
Hmmmm
I should be doing more rn
I'm booooorrrrrreeeeeedddd
ILL MAKE LOVE TO YOUUUUU WHEN YOU WANT ME TO
Ahh my feels.
If I ever have kids, I'm making them watch Big Hero 6. This is the movie I wish I could've watched when I was a kid. 😭
Yik Yak in non-college towns are very dry. 😔😭
:'(
I'm pretty excited to hear my roommate DJ tho.
My brother really wants me to watch Big Hero 6 lol
Someone keep me company at Panera while I do physics homework -_-
I have to do this.
"You won't make a career living here in Lancaster or Palmdale."
My mom has confirmed that two years from now I'm not living in Lancaster, I'll be up in NorCal.
Laundry then going to head to Panera to do homework all day. =_=
Lmao.
My knuckles are bruised. Shit.
Sleeepy
:D
Bruuuuuh
😱
I really think @nayhobunny should be at Merced with me. #ucmapaches
=_= I swear my roommates always get home before me.
Thinking about it, I've lost a lot of friends ever since college. The only person who's legit stuck around is like Jason lmao
I think it's crazy that next semester I'm going to live with my best friends. I'm so excited. 😭😁😁
Before I ever met you I never knew I could love so hard.
The next six weeks after spring break are going to be interesting.
