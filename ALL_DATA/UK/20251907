Also proper gutted that I didn't see Ben Howard tonight
The sheer effort required to pack right now is unreal. Just want to get into bed and watch Netflix 😩
Happy birthday @LaurenKeebs!! Have a lovely day xxxx
Hate not knowing what to do
So fed up its unreal
Why am I not at Coachella 😩
Love being bailed on and people not even having the decency to let you know 😊😊😊
The combination of being drunk and listening to Ben Howard is the best thing
Actually looking forward to going back to work tomorrow, am I okay
😔
Why do we have two tortoises? 😳
Literally feel like fucking death warmed up a little bit
The sheer temptation to just go travelling now and fuck uni off 💭✈️
Spent my three days at home so far in bed ill, this is a pisstake 😩
So fucking fed up of some people 😡
Seriously though, why do I not have this body?! http://t.co/AvB0ufLUtk
Not being able to sleep resulted in scrolling through fitness Twitter pages. I'm now depressed, yet still eating my second bag of crisps 😩
Whenever I come back home it feels like I never left in the first place
Mum can do one keep asking me if I've found myself a 'nice boyfriend yet'. Just about been home 24 hours, leave me alone ✋
Can't wait to just go home
Worst fucking mood 😔
Fucking ridiculous. Bouncers are such fucking arseholes it's unreal and think they have more power than what they actually do
Ribs and wine is going down a treat right now 😍
Telling my mum I'm getting my nose and hip pierced did not go as well as I thought it would at all
Some things put everything else into perspective. Needed some good news, so relived ❤️
Why am I still awake doing work 😩
I just don't understand why Phoebe is so drunk and balancing a lighter on her face
So fed up its unreal
Hate myself a little bit for listening to Alt-J on spotify without realising and enjoying it
Deadlines are genuinely going to be the death of me
First bit of good news in a long time 😊
So stressed its unreal 😩
Of course the one and only time I need to use the tumble dryer is the time the laundry room door locks itself so no one has access 😡😡
Happy birthday @chloekingston! Hope you've had a lovely day girl. Miss you xxxxx
First proper decent nights sleep in so long. Feels pretty good going to work on more than three hours sleep
WHY am I in Southampton 😩 http://t.co/6VZdj1ZaM9
Absolutely livid. Cannot get over how little respect some people in halls have for everyone else
So bored of seeing that dress thing everywhere
😡😡😡😡
Think I may have just successfully given myself food poisoning. Another thing to add to this foul mood I'm in
Can hear someone's alarm going off and I haven't even slept yet 😩
Sleeping for five hours when I got home from work was not my best idea. No sleep tonight 😩
Get wound up by things far too easily 😤
So bored of the whole who killed Lucy thing. I do not give a shitttttt
Still have the fucking scar 😂 @walmsley_ @ElliieCooper  http://t.co/DDET8h0u6P http://t.co/XfGDNqKUph
Strawberry, crushed Oreo and chocolate pancake is waaaay more appealing than toning up
Getting in from a shit day at work to find out the West Ham score has just put me in the worst mood
A roast dinner would go down an absolute treat right now. Where's my mum when I need her 😩
This whole no sleep thing is extremely boring now
Happy birthday @Frankzwankz! Hope you're having a lovely day gal, miss you 😘💖
Bored of my healthy eating bullshit, literally all I want right now is chocolate
Man U got fucking lucky that game
Toning up is going to be the death of me. Can't hack it
