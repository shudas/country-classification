Nick Clegg sounds like a little kid desperate to hang out with the older boys but they don't really want him around  https://t.co/nfXFcHyjdn
The highlight of this debate has been all the UKIP cunts making themselves known so I can unfollow them and also that picture of Ed Miliband
Seriously why bring up something that happened 35 years ago? #BBCDebate #irrelevant
Ed Miliband uses so much waffle ffs "I'm just going to say, I think this is important..." #BBCDebate
Farage's fixation with foreign HIV victims is so nasty #BBCDebate
Tbh I don't really care much about Trident but it's expensive as fuck and also quite close to me so I suppose I don't want it #BBCDebate
When Farage calls the audience thick 😩😬😬 #BBCDebate
In this election I have the option to vote in a Lab/Con marginal seat or a Lib Dem/SNP seat ~such power~
#BBCDebate Plaid Cymru are irrelevant to me so I'm just going to appreciate the accent
Ahh the #BBCdebate, can't wait to hear about Farage's tough stance on cancer patients or w/e tonight
I genuinely hate chemistry now, this degree has sucked away any sort of enjoyment I used to get from it
The thought of wearing unskinny jeans is quite distressing to me
My "fire" so far is just firelighters, can the coal get in on this shit plz
I accidentally let the fire go out again and now I'm trying to re-light it... I don't think it's going very well tbh
Hey, are you the HERG potassium ion channel? Because you're notoriously promiscuous towards basics
Omg Faith No More are playing on my 21st birthday which is also the day before my exams start ha ha I hate this degree 🔫🔫
"I'm not sure if [my 25y/o brother] will be able to cook this, maybe you can do it for him" haha fuck right off mum, never going to happen
I can't take Jim Murphy seriously lol how do you spend NINE YEARS at uni and not even get a degree??
My mum is going to maccas for me yaaasss
I accidentally let the fire go out, aka failed as a child 😔
Bonnie honestly looks wounded that I don't want her on my lap when I'm trying to study 😂
Dog selfies exactly one year apart http://t.co/NLS7qBFDYL
Not that it matters since I haven't been to church since leaving my catholic primary school
American churches look so much more entertaining than ours lol i wish we had a happy clappy gospel choir instead of some old man droning on
I didn't choose the high life the high life chose me xx #ayyy #420blazeit http://t.co/c0oG88pB8E
I forgot how much it actually rained here ie. every fucking day
Ewww feels so wrong watching the sex scenes between Margaery and Tommen given that he's meant to be like 13 😷😷 #gameofthrones
So bored being at home -_-
If the wildlings have northern English accents then are Scottish people the white walkers 😩 #gameofthrones
I rediscovered the pair of sparkly silver skinny jeans I bought a few years ago, questionable purchase but I feel like I have to own it now
My first creme egg in a few years and omg ok they're definitely getting smaller
I asked my mum if she would buy me some wine while she's out and she laughed in my face 😔
My spirit animal http://t.co/k9J7rgWsA2
The only bad thing about that is that there'll be a five week GoT drought and possibly on a cliffhanger 😩
The rest of my life can be put on hold, first five episodes of Game of Thrones leaked!! 😍😍
This nap has lasted so long it's segued into my night sleep
Catching up on #BattleForNumber10, no wonder lots of people aren't engaged in politics they're both v uninspiring it's a case of "least bad"
Grand National and Oxford vs. Cambridge boat race on the same day, what a great day to be a white middle class English person
The Armenian genocide was just as awful as the Holocaust in many respects, yet most people have never heard of it which is really sad :/
There's still snow on the hills here!
Pimms is actually rank I have no idea why English people love it so much
I can hear the rain beating down on my wheelie bin and I'm trying to pretend that it's relaxing but it's actually fucking annoying
If I ever become a famous musician I promise to make at least one song repping the home town #fortwilliam4eva
Bonnie likes to be swaddled in a blanket 😍😍 http://t.co/aJAZU8RGdC
My mum is asking what I want from the menu at my sister's wedding and I'm like it's three months away lol I don't care
Bonnie is such a clingy dog she just wants to be cuddled up to someone all the time
Checking Yik Yak and still seeing the ones I upvoted during the Christmas holidays #ruralproblems
I like when English politicians stand in front of Edinburgh Castle totes not cliché at all and shows a deep understanding of Scottish people
This Tidal thing is such bullshit no way would I pay 4x as much for what is basically Spotify
How did I not realise how teuchter my family is, mum is proudly showing me all the Skippinish on her iPod
Morning dog cuddles and Easter eggs 😍😍 #breggfast
I really want to play Tap Tap Revenge rn but it doesn't exist any more
Lolol I hear there's a ~lib dem vs snp turf war~ on Fort William high street
Wearing #shades on the train 80% to block out the sun 20% for the #sweg
On the announcement for the Fort William train they pronounce nearly every Highland destination name wrong jfc 😂
Throwback to the time I missed the train here literally as it was sitting in the platform because I couldn't see it &gt;_&lt;
I used to think Glasgow Queen Street was this massive transport hub, now it seems minuscule even Vauxhall and Wimbledon are bigger than this
You know you're in Tourist London when people take pictures of buses in a non-autistic way
Actually pretty keen to be going back home today ☺️
I always want to pack like I'm going on a round the world trip instead of a short visit home
Omfg I just pulled back the shower curtain and this MASSIVE FUCKING COCKROACH fell down 😷😷😷 glad I'm leaving the flat today haha
Back to Scotland today ☺️
I'm hungry and don't have any dinner material but it feels like it's not worth the effort to go shopping since I'm leaving tomorrow morning
Yer da tweets Babestation girls
Holy shit my bleached hair makes me look like a failed Viserys Targaryen
Shiiiit my nose and chin are REALLY RED and I have to go out in public soon looking like a chemical peel victim
Accidentally bleached some of my hair pink...
Looking beaut with the 'cling film veil' look atm xx
Bleaching my hair again but I have so much hair the bottle ran out just as I started the second half oops
Back from Portugal! Nice weather in Landaaan today but it doesn't exactly compare haha
So at the drop zone I was basically known as "that girl who's always sleeping" yet it's 1:30AM and I'm the only one awake 😔
Night at the airport because our flight is 7am 😴😴 shattered already
Leaving the DZ to go to the airport wehhhh :(
Didn't even finish AFF but I bought a skydiving hoodie because I'm #srs and #legit
Lol @ people here #swegging round like they're shit hot skydivers when they're really not 😂
"You died on Friday, slept on Saturday and Sunday morning and woke up... you're basically Jesus" http://t.co/QXheTLn3QU
If my brother steals my Easter eggs before Friday I will shank him. We are 25 and 20 respectively
The best sort of guilt tripping is when mum brings the dog into it 😂 "come back, Bonnie is missing her auntie"
It started raining here and people are freaking the fuck out haha
Apparently my strong nap game has been documented on camera throughout the week
I have been sleeping literally all day this is not good
A few weeks ago I'd been out and the vom kicked in at 7pm the next day! :/
Why have I started getting these ridiculous delayed hangovers THIS IS NOT OKAY
lol @ how the entrance to the cafe here has a big poster basically saying "taps aff forbidden"
Not sure if hungover or still drunk...
We've moved from the Playboy Mansion to a place which doesn't even have wi-fi, sad times :/
My face may be burnt (apart from the sunglasses region) but my stomach and legs are still so white I look like I grew up in Fritzl's cellar
Finished the AFF course woo 🎉 #skydiving just the consols now
Hey I've just realised this is a #springbreak lolol
Using my phone in the pool #lifeontheedge #danger
Green wine is vastly superior to red or white. Get on that shit.
It's too windy to skydive so we're going to chill in the pool instead. Life is so hard right now 😥 http://t.co/1ckIWNmKGa
My uni gives me £6k a year in bursary to help fund my education and I'm spending it going skydiving in Portugal #sorrynotsorry
A guy from my group went into the plane AND FORGOT HIS FUCKING PARACHUTE I actually can't even
Did I really just get charged £30 to transfer money from my savings account 😩😩 fuck you Bank of Scotland
I just did a skydive where you do a roly-poly in mid air, it was fucking so awesome! 👌#skydiving #aff
When I deploy the parachute I always get a huge wedgie and my inner thighs are all bruised #skydiverprobs
Predicted high of 27 degrees = #tapsaff #sunsoutgunsout #skysoutthightsout (all of the above are already happening and it's 19 atm)
This trip is fun but exhausting, every spare moment is basically spent sleeping
Totally did not just crash a parachute onto a barbed wire fence... (I totally did) (I didn't hit it the canopy did)
Drinking wine every day here but it's okay I'm a classy European not an alkie
Portugal has been pretty #rad so far 👌
This is where we're staying!! #playboymansion http://t.co/s1KBoEWPDQ
Ground training today! #skydiving #aff
It's so lovely here just chilling having breakfast on this sunny square by the water 👌☺️
This guy on the square is the ultimate FASHION DAD and currently busting some moves to the sax/tambourine combo 👌👌
Hey bb I'm not Ian Watkins but it's 4am and I'm alone
No shoe vom happened@afaik
I vommend on the@street and some Portuguese bouncer was legit raging at me and demanding I clean it up, rumour goes I vommed on his shoes???
I'm like 99% sure I saw a guy from my course at Heathrow security omg #smallworld
I just looked at my exam timetable, my birthday is the 14th of June and my exams are the 15th, 16th and 18th ffs #worst21stever
I hardly ever get messages on fb now I have six at once omg pressure to be social
No more coursework this term yaaaay! 🎉☺️
I have like zero ability to deal with stress my lab report isn't finished and is due in an hour and I'm freaking out on the inside :|
My alarm is called "more shots" but I'm using it to get up early to do work :(
Omg does that qualify me to use all the outdoor slang?? #stoked
I can't believe I'm going skydiving in the Algarve NEXT WEEK I am so psyched for this 😊😊
McDonald's monopoly is back yay now I might get rewarded for my poor lifestyle choices
Damn I've been up doing work for so long I feel like Bernard Ponsonby
Idk why people are like "#cutforzayn is trivialising it for people with real problems!" like actually doing that indicates a real problem
This #cutforzayn thing is so obviously fake idk why people keep falling for this
Literally what the fuck is Virgin Radio Lebanon and why is it never off my news feed??
Never mind though #troopingon largely because night buses are a pain in the ass and I want to get this shit done asap
Omg i'm so dumb, I didn't even consider the possibility that the chemistry building might close and now all my lab report stuff is in there
When the person you're with is at the bar and it looks like you have no pals 😐
I'm postponing my lab report all-nighter to go to sports night at the union, worst or best student ever??
#AlwaysInOurHeartsZaynMalik he hasn't died lol
The other day the coffee vending machines in libe cafe AND Sherfield were broken I s2g they better be fixed because I need caffeine for this
Meant to be doing an all-nighter tonight but I'm so fucking tired already 😴😴 and its half seven!
lol so much ~1d drama~
"This Warwick graduate did his entire dissertation in one forty hour sitting http://t.co/lsy5ALrxru" terrifying glimpse into my future 😩😩
Inexplicably there is no skydiving related emoji so unfortunately skiing ones will have to do 🏂🏂
Today I was tearing it up in the wind tunnel 🏂🏂 aka trying and not really succeeding in doing the most basic stuff
I've just realised that the jumper I bought the other day is almost exactly the same colour as my primary school jumper 😣
#toptune RIP xx http://t.co/wtlyMp0MTS
Waiting on a couch in a shop and I'm legit so close to just lying down and falling asleep 😴
When I get invited to more than one house party on the same night http://t.co/UG3aOTtqKt
Hey that plane in Malaysia has been gone for a year now, I'd forgotten about it tbh
Only three more weeks until Game of Thrones is back 😍😍
Holy shit some people are so SERIOUS about Primark though you literally see people with those drag-along baskets overflowing
It was so amazing though, in fact it was borderline sexual #filthycapitalistbitch
Oh my fucking god I somehow managed to spend over two hours at the big Primark on Tottenham Court Road??? 😂😂 not even saying what £ I spent!
If shopping in Waitrose is a normal thing for you then there's a 100% chance you're middle class
I didn't know I was hungry but I just went to the supermarket and had to restrain myself from buying all the snacks #allthesnacks
I am so not prepared for this being the last week of term I assumed we had like a month left
Uni must have been so much harder without Google and Wikipedia! So happy they were invented in time for me &lt;3
I have my scooter at home and I looked so badass #shredding down beside the loch, but one day I fell down the hill and now I have a scar :/
When I first moved to this flat I genuinely thought I would be using my kick-scooter to travel the 5 miles to uni on a regular basis lolwut
Start of labs vs. end of labs... http://t.co/tsirtBMvIT
Just submitted my lab report, check my emails for the turn it in receipt, get assigned my next lab report #blessed
Sky's out thighs out is in force lolol
Eclipse update: I got cold so I went back inside
Please fellow students put the eclipse glasses away, you really don't need them 😂
The sky does indeed look a bit darker but only in the "it's going to rain in a bit" way
What a let down 😂 http://t.co/A8oTJ8ZCsV
Is this eclipse meant to be happening the now? It just looks like the same cloudy London as ever!
.@ENTERSHIKARI is ideal all-nighter music 👌 #yourenotgettinganysleeptonight
When I'm up late doing a lab report it always makes me feel better when I see other chem people online via web, I feel less alone haha
Oh my god it's 9:15 at night and the computer area is still as busy as it was at 12pm :/
Teuchter 4 life tho
Yaaass so excited for this free Ben &amp; Jerry's cone, the nearest participating store is a mere 100 miles away!! #highlandproblems
I regret my choice of library seat since its next to some couple who keep getting off 😷😷 #getaroom
When I have my shit together I can beast through assignments (like now) unfortunately that only happens about 1% of the time nowadays
I haaaaate the phrase ~real woman~ just because I'm not a size 14 it doesn't make me a fucking mannequin
"There is still another price to be paid for this wealth of detail, and that is the very task of digesting it, of assimilating it, of..."
mrw I see someone else with blue hair http://t.co/ZfV8K9aCrZ
I would tell my med chem lecturers this but apparently they already know and the cure for cancer is being suppressed because illuminati 😑
Oh man, one day a girl I know made a status about how ~the cure for cancer lies within the body~ or some shit, as a scientist it was painful
If you believe in homeopathy or astrology basically I'm just going to disregard anything science-related you say
I curse the day my mum discovered IG http://t.co/cCvGV6KAQ7
When you're staying at someone else's house but you're the only one awake :/
