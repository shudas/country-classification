Do not provoke a pregnant lady. She will attack with a ferocity that can compare to a rabid mongoose #happywife #oops
OMG!!! @kyleturris you sir, have a filthy set of hands! That was amazing to watch! #Sens
Tough decision or not you have to commit! Put everything you got into it &amp; give it your best shot. Anything less and your lying to yourself
Put that work in. Grind it out. Laugh in the face of adversity. I pave my own path. I won't be held back. I won't stop. No quit. All Hustle.

Does ANYONE have 2 tickets to the game on Thursday!?!? Huge night for the #sens and the fans! Being there would complete me! #gottix
The Canadian support this year is amazing! But just because the day will end doesn't mean that our show of support should! #showmeyourpoppy
Thank u for all that you've done and will continue to do. Your sacrifice is a gift this country is blessed to have. #alwaysremember #Canada
Don't take for granted the freedoms we enjoy, they weren't free at all. Stand tall. Be proud. I love this country #CanadaStrong #neverforget
RIP Cpl Nathan Cirillo. Your death, although tragic, will be this Nations spark to fight these assholes #bombsoverbaghdad #letsgo
Thru thick and thin you were there Bros since I was 12 I'll always remember you Buddy. #rip #bestdog #betterplacenow http://t.co/Pc2SLjsQHN

And to all the French speaking Canadians - "Happy Canada Day"
#fingeritout
Happy Canada Day!!! Here's hoping that the #sens do something proactive and not self-destructive! #canada #beersandBBQ
Hate it when that happens!!!! #riiiiiiiiiiip #workshorts #lastpair #fml http://t.co/aXAntapY5t
I've come to the conclusion that Eric Brewer is the Tampa version of Chris Phillips... That is all
#buccigrossotchallenge Tyler Johnson and Vanek
WOW!!! My jaw hurts from hitting the floor... #Spezza #Silkymitts #GoSENSGo #pleasedonttradehim
Amazing show of class and respect by @EdmontonOilers to Smyth! @MelnykEugene @Senators take some notes! #signalfie #onemoregame #AlfieAlfie

If I'm Robin Lehner, I'm in Coach Mac's ear all ride home about how much I want the net tomorrow
Wow. That was a blown game by Ottawa, but Jesus... Blow the fucking whistle. Cowen and Lehners reaction just about sums up the 13/14 season
If the #Sens can pull out with 2 points here it's great, but damn! Horrible period and a half of hockey. Hate rewarding bad play
And I stand corrected. Montreal is not mailing it in. That is now ottawa. Brutal 1:30 of play right there
Typical Travis Moen, show up when the game is over. #GoSENSGo
Is it just me or is Montreal just standing around and mailing it in for the final 5 mins?? #Sens
Wow @BrandonPrust8 is one tough guy! #clown #impactplayer #brutal
Everybody should check out @broker4tickets !!! Awesome deals on tix! #sens
