A new French drain at work has been nicely landscaped. Lately there has been a population of gnomes moving randomly about it. I approve.
I'm going to have coffee. Try to stop me and the violence of my actions will stun you.
I feel a strong urge to root for the Thorns.
Just watched Judas Priest at the Us Festival in '83. Why don't they have shows like that anymore?
I don't mean to drag politics into football but it recently came to my attention that Drew Carey voted for Bush sr. 
Twice!

Probably.
The day I willingly put on a sweater-vest, I pray that one of you garrote me when I least expect it.
been stuck in a think tank for 4 days. What did I miss? Timbers lost, Thorns won, T2 lost, Liverpool won.
Thorns home, Timbers away this wk
Liverpool v Newcastle highlights just starting.
If Liverpool FC &amp; Arsenhole make the cup final, there should be a gathering.

One day I will learn to eat enchiladas in moderation.
That day is not today.
This staff meeting sponsored by the Department of Redundancy Department for Redundancy.
I actually wrote this: "as identified in Tab B in Appendix 5 of Annex O." Kill me now.
Glad to see liverpool took care of business today.
Based on the stats, Liverpool is controlling their match with the magpies?
inasmuch as I was unable to attend the match &amp; havent watched "highlights," the result is void, as are all other results not favoring us.
I like to think that I support a "free-range" side. Which, for your safety is also gluten-free and unencumbered by the need to score goals.
Home at 7pm. This gets less fun every year.
Timbers lost, it's almost 5pm on a Sunday and I'm stuck in an everlasting staff meeting. #FML
My TL is making my heart hurt.
Based solely on your tweets, I am committing to a Timbers goal in the next 7 minutes and 22 seconds.
What are you all doing!?! Sing!
My gut is in a knot because I can't be at the match today. I need all of you to be hoarse by 4pm. If you aren't, you aren't timbers.
Just had the chance to watch the Thorns highlights...nice finishing, distribution from midfield and solid goalkeeping. #BAONPDX
In true military fashion,the Operations Plan for a Cascadia Subduction Zone Event has been nicknamed "OP Plan Shakey." #CarryOn
I find myself in the strange position of having to pull for ManU. 
Such are the fortunes of football.
Come on Wankchester Ushited!
Booooooo! #SeaLionsIN https://t.co/1ENe6Nw17t
Are the @ThornsFC highlights out yet?
Driving again, please tag me on any Thorns or T2 updates!
Thorns score?
Currently working on Appendix 4 of Annex O if that gives you any idea of how my day is going.
Just saw the strangest thing.  Two baseball teams playing baseball. They still do that?
LTRS: eating chocolate will satisfy a craving for sweets.
Intern notices my wedding picture:
"Wow, look at all that hair! Do you wish you still had it?"
Me:"Wow! The job market must be really good!"
