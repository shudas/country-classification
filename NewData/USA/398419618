Idk why but I'm feeling Johnny Cash today
Happy Birthday to the greatest coach this world has ever seen, Bill Belichick #PatsNation http://t.co/MP46wDkcg1
Phillip Rivers better pray he isn't traded. He's a good QB, but going anywhere without his security blanket in Antonio Gates would hurt him
Key to success in anything you do is networking
Feel bad for Odin Lloyds family too. Can't imagine what it's been like these last 2 years of sitting and waiting to see what happened.
But hey AH81 chose to continue a life of stupidity even though he had worked his whole life to get to where he was able to leave that life.
Feel for AH81s daughter. Growing up without a father sucks, but I can't imagine growing up knowing you have one and he's in jail.
His lawyers are known for winning appeals so let's see if that happens, but it's highly unlikely.
If that wasn't said I truly believe that he would've been found not guilty on 1st or 2nd degree murder and would've only served gun charges.
AH81's lawyer shot AH81 in the foot when he said he was present at the time of the murder.
Still baffled that AH81 got life yesterday... The prosecution didn't prove anything without a reasonable doubt, all speculation.
There's something about red heads...

Average pitchers usually get rocked
Gotta hope the Nats make multiple errors again
Can't expect them to put up 6-8 runs a game
Sox need to atleast get 2 half way decent starters
