God damn it! Why can't it be an appropriate sleeping time yet?
I was very happy with that episode of @GameOfThrones
Does anyone else think Andrew Garfield is  cute?
Everyone keeps asking for my duck pic, so here it is. Enjoy. http://t.co/oc2IApcFLD

Oh my god there are these amazing Swisse boys in line beside me. I think I know where I am heading next holiday üòù
Cunts skipping in line at customs. Fuck you. What makes you think you're allowed to do that??
It better for a man to dress casually than wear an ill fitting suit.
I did not miss the Australian accent...
In America, guys who look like they walked off the set of a #SeanCody movie wanted me, back home the best I can get is #AllAustralianBoys
I don't want to go home, but then again, @GameOfThrones starts soon, and I need to be back for that.
Last day in #SanFrancisco
I loved every minute here. Can't wait to come back again. #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/9IDyb3YeTF
Horse Pepsi ok?
Neigh
Which number is higher, the cost of this meal, or the number of calories in a single bite?

Look I'm away at the moment, but this "#ReclaimAustralia thing seems ill conceived.
No filter. Just sunburned like a lobster. #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/W2FfBDOfYX
I'm terrified of returning to reality. #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/x00kr8xTaX
Chilling by the pool. (Renting one of these beds is $40!!! Fuck you Vegas!) #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/moxs6t6g4K
No one wants to be that guy who swims with his shirt on.
People say Vegas is good people watching, it is for a bit, but if this is a snap shot of humanity it's also depressing.
Grindr extra is a waste of money in Australia. 
In Vegas it is essential. So many fuck wits #BlockBlockBlock
Just saw @jeffdunham at @PlanetHollywood 
The man is a genius. So funny. #IKillYou
I needed to take a pee break the this is the urinal! http://t.co/qa09Wl8eWn
Death awaits. 
How fast is this in KM's? #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/02oehalkHq
Driving to #Vegas #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/Dm7og17C1a
If I had a dollar for every white person I've seen in LA, I'd have about $40.
Him: coffee?
Me: tea please. Earl grey or English breakfast.
Him: I think we're all out
Me:...
(returns with a pot)
Me: what is it?
Him: tea
MY accent is changing constantly. I don't even know why?! #HenryDoesUSA

Duff beer at Moe's Tavern. All of you should be jealous. #TheSimpsons #UniversalStudio #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/vzPstkKjYi
Seriously it's a bar, with the Simpson on in the background. Why would I ever leave? #UniversalStudio #HenryDoesUSA
I can die a happy man. #UniversalStudio #TheSimpsons #HenryDoesUSA  @UniStudios http://t.co/ewfJH27eR0

Who recognises this chair? #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/PbBxzZjUd9
My god it's like my dreams. #Simpsons #HenryDoesUSA #UniversalStudio @kemal_atlay @TheFrinkahedron @denjaminbeakins http://t.co/ixXBBFjvrO
I think that the Californian accent sounds kinda gay, or maybe it's all the gay Californian guys I've been having over. #HenryDoesUSA
Oh my god the spoiled white kids in this VIP lounge are terrifying. #UniversalStudio #HenryDoesUSA
The VIP ticket at #UniversalStudio is totally worth 10 regular tickets. #HenryDoesUSA
UNIVERSAL STUDIOS TODAY!! #excited #VIP #HenryDoesUSA @UniStudios
First Grindr now it's "Lavendr" is it?
I respect Tinder for actually having er in its  name.
Australia. You're doing burgers, and especially thick shakes wrong. #HenryDoesUSA http://t.co/BtnjZSkpRy
I walked 2 blocks though an ethnic neighbourhood to get a burger. It was fucking terrifying but I survived. 
Burger is on the way.
So many people in convertibles here. #LosAngeles
All the hotties are on rodeo drive. All of them. They are nowhere else in all of L.A. I've been looking #HenryDoesUSA
It's only 3pm here and I just hit a wall. I need to sleep. But I can't :(
There is a shit ton of traffic in California. #HenryDoesUSA
This Aussie chick on the tour bus just keeps singing for everyone to hear It was tolerable the first time but needs to end now #HenryDoesUSA
Australia has better mango than California #HenryDoesUSA
They made a Paul Blart mall cop 2??
I wanna eat at every place here. #HenryDoesUSA
Apparently it costs 30 grand to get a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.
I don't know what equinox is, but I want it #HenryDoesUSA #LA http://t.co/wDm7xo3AiD
It seems that in L.A you can be in any car and just wind down the windows and act gangster.
L.A is like a concrete Brisbane on steroids.
I'm alive everyone, thanks for asking üòù
Oh my god the flight attendant is so hot. All is good again.
There is legit a crying baby behind me. Just my luck üò£
Hahaha. The bearded guy gets "randomly" screened again. I'm getting sick of this crap.
Lining up in the economy line is like that bit in the Titanic where the lady says "we have to wait for the first class passengers"
I need to think of a hashtag for my trip. Something like poochie, but more proactive. #HenryDoesUSA
If the lady sitting next to me is sitting next to me on the plane... This is gonna be a loooooooong flight.
I'm gonna fall in love in America... With the accent.
I'm at my mates wedding out in the middle of nowhere. It's awesome.
P.S. I hate Jackie Sharp and Heather Dunbar #HouseOfCards
#HouseOfCards #Chapter37 #Epic
The debate episode of #HouseOfCards is awesome.
