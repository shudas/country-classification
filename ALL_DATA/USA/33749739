In other news @awolnation just dropped their album like right now so I'm logging off the internet and going to cry all the happy tears.
Also, if i had a $1 for every twenty one pilots fan online right now, I'd probably have enough money to buy fairly local over 100,000 times
that's the thing about twenty √∏ne pil√∏ts,  everytime you think they can't out-do themselves,  there they are again out-doing it. frick.
