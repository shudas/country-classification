#grimm on @Watch_channel 😁
Is there no new #flash this week on @sky1 😢
So I guess when someone doesn't thank u for a present it probably means they probably didn't like it.
#BackInTheRoom utter rubbish makes me wanna leave my room!
Aye give her the holiday coz she looked miserable otherwise #snt
Emma Watson!!!! #RND15 #VicarOfDibley
Why did the vote for #scd for comic relief close so soon could it not have closed during red nose on Fri @BBCOne?
Just watching #StrictlyComeDancing for #RND15 so enjoyable think the winner should come onto real show against other celebs
5 minutes into #BillionPoundHotel and my jaw is on the floor wow!
Dam auto correct my last rt was fab a fab look back at one of #ER's finest not a fan look back!
"@TVGuide: #ER: An oral history of "Love's Labor Lost." Fan look back http://t.co/819fts0kXK http://t.co/poKaAmNERk"
Oh good grief the #Eurovision song is beyond bad its in the place where there ate no words to describe how lame it is.
Cracking idea to watch #thefollowing before bed will never 😴 now!
178 days until #vegas the wait is killing me!
That woman is annoying I would've picked the boy if I had too #TheVoice
"@MichaelAusiello: Shocker: Jada Pinkett Smith Leaving GOTHAM http://t.co/P83463ELLG" best TV news of the day.
Hi @robin_wiggs so fortitude then jeepers Darren Boyd extra creepy everyone sleeping with everyone &amp;an arm just hanging -love it!
Watching #Fortitude OMG what do they put in the water up there?
Omg Chris Moyles's head is huge! He's lost too much weight #GBBOComicRelief
So #tvd are back can anyone remember wtf happened last time it was on? Is bonnie still stuck in 90's?
The new trailer to #BatesMotel is creepy looking forward to it coming back.
And #fortitude @robin_wiggs didn't see that coming but the pettigrew murder more intriguing but I still doubt the little boy acted alone
Hi @robin_wiggs watched ep2 of #Critical thank goodness for Lennie James can't take my eyes off him but will it last as I didn't care about
😘😘 Rick Grimes #TWD

Surprised too @robin_wiggs that *spoiler* isn't in the episode until end and yet it is still extremely strong masterstroke by jed.
