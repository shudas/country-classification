As if my Xbox One just blew up and broke :-( Was eaten by a bear on @FarCrygame while it happened #badtimes
Present day Disney makes me feel sad
Got an Xbox One today :-) @xboxuk @Xbox Now to spend the rest of the day playing Halo Master Chief Collection.... :P
People are complete arseholes when they have money. Disrespecting and berating people won't make you any happier nor will you have friends ✌
I really wanna start watching Game of Thrones. Gonna have to catch up on all seasons tho and last time I did that was for @cw_spn
I knew it was love, I knew @skyferreira

My phone is sooo annoyingly bright. Even at lowest level feels like I'm staring at the sun 😅😩
https://t.co/qBKAbbEJqP Luke Minnis is a prime example of one of these twats
There's being in a relationship then there's straight up scripted tumblr goals bullshit 👋
Hate these lads who purposely act like they're all cute attempting to lure girls to them #twats #makesmecringe
Just gonna un private my acc and hope my family dont find it... 😅
Twitter is so annoying when it comes to follower requests... Wont even let me allow people to follow me cause my acc is privated 😓

Don't like the thought of artists releasing their videos 'exclusive' to @TIDALHiFi ...
Masochism #getfuckingready
HYPE IS SO REAL @skyferreira http://t.co/tY2Pw1JR6v via @pitchfork
I can't tell if I like Radiohead or not...
Love when all of my friends make plans with each other and don't invite me 😊
I'm so happy for my brother - he finally met @NICKIMINAJ and got his copy of her album signed! 😄
Happy Easter 🐣
Really wanna see the new Spongebob film 😅
And I'm just about sick of parents and teachers not teaching you about life. Seems they just want to get rid of you asap
To an extent you need assistance. Yes, everyone wants independence - but you can't rule the world
You know there's these wonderful things called communication and assistance?
No wonder teenagers are so fucking confused on how to access essential things in life. People can't do things on their own, sadly they must!
I want to actually know what's going on. Not knowing isn't beneficial to people because its really happening, stop trying to hide it!
I'm sick of being protected against issues going on in society and the world.
Forgot how good @taylorswift13 's 1989 album was. 'Clean' is my fav ✌
Want! http://t.co/dL5jKZ0sn7

Can't get a job until August :-( Doing the NCS challenge in July, doubt any workplace would let me take time off if I got one before July
I have no idea what I'm going to do in this 2 weeks holiday. People are so boring when they leave school 😅

I’ve joined Autism Speaks to Light It Up Blue on April 2nd. Join me and shine a light on autism! #LIUB http://t.co/Vk32A4dYP3
I see 'gay' still used as a term to refer to something as 'stupid' or 'silly'. Very disrespectful
Planning on buying @TheSims 4 and hibernating for a few weeks 😅
Didn't even know they had a new album coming! Well excited @summercampband  http://t.co/MMicCQVxSm via @sharethis
Relationships can make or break you, meh not gonna bother with them for a while
Can't believe I let myself get fairly upset over someone! Just gonna focus on what makes me happy tbh
When parents watch you on your phone... *opens candy crush and ignores all texts*
Got a lonely Starbucks lover 😅 cannot unhear
Joke of a human being! Horrendous, vile, evil you name it... http://t.co/qbHTAnE1Jx
I'm so tired of parents making their children feel insecure and doubting what they want in life
Doing this in summer! http://t.co/0ouEzIRyOW

Wendy wu was the shit
lovely way to start the day 🍟 #mcdonalds https://t.co/ify1emzJ1j
really hope rihanna's last ig post means she'll release a new song tomorrow. absolutely love fourfiveseconds
so please, stop kiss arsing artists when they sell relatively good and then when they don't you decide to stop liking them. lel feck off
if you actually have to justify your favourite artist is good by their sales, you're deluded. music matters most because it has meaning
does anyone care about music anymore? this industry is fucked up by the twats who feed off of chart positions and album sales
stunning 🌅 https://t.co/jLod7SUqDN
#Cut4Zayn

Earning something and achieving success on your own is what makes me happy
Money doesn't phase me, if I had a billion pounds I wouldn't be happy....
I've learned I don't need a variety of something in particular to make myself happy
When someone says they dont like @marinasdiamonds ...  https://t.co/kGD3kBeOYl
Hate feeling clingy...

never seen the solar eclipse :-(
Its the worst staying in the house all day, feel so lazy urghhhh help aha
I'm so excited for summer, wonderful weather and getting a job 😅
In some cases people are just rude, those people need to work out their own problems and work on them
As long as you're happy doing something that doesn't effect people negatively, you're all good
Some people need to get their shit together and stop being negative. Find something to do that makes you happy, cause hating isn't working
There is no need for the amount of hatred people recieve. The things I see people writing on the internet are vile and negative
😂 http://t.co/wMJ3CNLEz5
I hate falling asleep through the day
FREE EHE FREE EHEHE EHEHEHEH @MarinasDiamonds
