“If he didn't clip him the guy had a chance on the tackle so really that block in the back helped him get outside like that”. No way!!

Haven't even left the ground yet and I can tell this is going to be a #longflight ✈️
It should be mandatory that anyone that is going to #fly should have to take a class on how to pack a fucking overhead.  #goddamn people.
There should be separate flights for people that don't fly often so they don't irritate the fuck out of us that do!!
Off to Sweden for a few days.  ✈️
Gonna be a long drive home!!  Murder - Suicide has I75 N closed in Monroe, Ohio.  F'n great.  #GunControl needs to be improved in the #USA.
Appears some asshole decided to shoot his wife on I75 N in Monroe, Ohio. This is after killing his kids at home.  #rotinhell ASSHOLE!!!
Kentucky, y'all!!😜

And to make it worse, I only have 20 Mb of data left on my wifi Jetpack.  Whoa is me.....
This isn't looking promising.  No plane, no crew, no hotels.  This flight better go tonight. ✈️
Pool is up and running.  Officially open for the summer.  Who's up for a #swim?  💦🏊
Back in Canada. #Timmies in hand.
Ate salad all week so I could have @SkylineChili on my way thru Ohio. #3way all the way!!
Note to self:  don't plan work to end in the US the Friday of the #MemorialDayWeekend.  Traffic nightmare!!  🚙🚗🚕🚛🚚🚌🚓🚐
