I was texting mum telling her I quit my job and all she can talk about is how one of the dogs has a new collar
So I quit my job and I feel great
I can't handle this anymore
My friend told me have a good day and I almost cried lol
I feel like I'm going to pass out because of how nervous I am
I wish that I could be rich for no reason
I feel sick because of how nervous I am
I don't start for another two hours
I'm so nervous for work today
I am so nervous for work today
It completely backfired hahha
One of my friends posted a status omg I don't know why so many girls are getting their boobs done so stupid blahblah blah

Oops I'm in trouble at work for saying something about being rostered on when I had annual leave approved damn
I will not be doing that
Well this better change
I just caught a glimpse of our unfinished roster for next week. I am rostered on to work my birthday and all the days I requested off
Every person here who gets one are of nationalities who have big noses and damn the piercings don't suit
Why are they so cool toget this is not 2011
I am that fucking over septum piercings too
I hate this place I hate the negativity of this stupid cunt of a place
So sad
I decided I am going to be a vet nurse and start studying next year
Thinking about being a vet
I am so cut
All I have to do is be drunk and bop around a bit I can do that I'll hve fake tits soon too
I would get better money for less effort
Maybe I should become a stripper
The entire shopping centre not just my work
I'm fucking so incredibly over this piece of shit place
I fucking hate everyone and everything and I fucking hate where I work
Crying for real now that I am on my way home
I was told again that I will not be going back to penrith and I almost cried
Don't mess with me I'll put a curse on you mother fucker
I want to be a Wiccan like my aunty
Is everyone definitely coming to my birthday
...and also weren't asked if it was okay???
Do you think it is okay for someone to put stickers from their religions bible up at work with people who don't follow that religion...

I've had it for five months still got hypertrophic scarring
Don't ever get an industrial piercing they don't heal
Retired my industrial last night fuck healing that shit
Sad about Damon being at the gym and not with me here where he belongs
I actually refuse to pierce tongue webbing hahaha yes
So over the whole tongue webbing piercing trend right now
Piercings are seriously so gay when will people grow up
Today a wheel chair lady who was like 55 asked me to pierce her clit
Omg sorry for all my typos I wa trying to walk through a crowd and tweet at the same time
I said um those people aren't feminists then are they and she was like yep good answer
My sister asked he day if I was a feminist that did it didn't include trains women and I almost slapped her
My hair so ugly I so sad
Some babies are cute and some babies are hideous but no babies are just normal

36 replies is it worth the read?? @Fab_Bitchxx @lizzygracebird
I want to buy myself a very sparkely necklace
One month and two days until my consultation
How do I die without it hurting
A month and a half until I have two weeks off push through it
And it's not like I'm going to make that store do well it's impossible.
I don't get it I have so many clients at Penrith I make so much money and they move me to a place that has one piercing a day
They transfer me
How can I go from not wanting to leave work to not wanting to leave for work in a week
I have heaps of clothes to buy after I get my boobs done so excited
I can't escape the negativity
Swearing is okay when it is not excessive but when it is it really makes a person seem extra feral and unintelligent
I hate this whole "drink drank drunk" business
I really don't feel important to anyone anymore
I fuxjing hate every stupid cunt here
Holy fucking shit I can't even explain how much I hate this place
Clearly no one at parramatta knows what personal hygiene is
The only reason I live in Penrith is for this job then they move me to parramatta and I absolutely fucking hate this place
So now i am constantly angry because there is like one hour a day that I am not near people I fucking hate or on my way to them
I live somewhere I hate to work a job I now hate.
I am so fucking over my life right now
I love it when people who spend like five dollars on a tattoo are like omg my tattoo is perf so detailed no you haven't seen a good tattoo
If people at work I don't like bitch about my manager who I do like should I tell her
Of course I hop in the train with the annoying loud ferals with a baby
I am starting to wonder what's the point
I'm so cranky about people
Like there is no possible way it could look good it looks like you're 3 years old and got into mums makeup
And it looks even worse in real life
I can not even get over how stupid over drawing your lips looks I just can't
Baby fell asleep on my lap http://t.co/oD61gxt96x
Now she has two plastic cups incase she breaks one lol
She just said "lucky I didn't knock my bottle over aswell" and laughed a lot hahahah
She's that cute
Hahahaha
My great grandma just spilled her baileys all over the floor and smashed the glass and she goes "I've made a lot of mistakes in my life"
Coal stepped on wee and walked in the lounge http://t.co/3n3MIektg9

Every time I think about it I am so nervous
Just paid the deposit for my boobies this is starting to feel real
I get Fridays and Saturdays off now so anyone wanna party!!????
I accidentally pocked accept friend requests
I want long black hair and to wear pretty pink clothes
I'm on my way to work and I'm so nervous I feel sick
I hate being the quiet one at work who everyone feels like they can just push over and talk shit
Damon's at the gym so I am sad
And obviously Damon I love him a lot
For a boob job that's why
The only reason I live here is my job now I hate my job all of a sudden why am I still here
I have almost no reason to be here anymore
My legs are in so much pain from work today
I really want to wash my hair but I don't want to hop up at all
Standing on the train makes me feel so sick
I should not have to feel like this at work
I feel like absolute shit
I am dying
I am actually in pain because of how nervous I am
Level one is terrifying
I can't deal with this
Oh god I've gotten asked to work on level one I am actually having a panic attack
It's so feral not the store I work in just te area and the customers are very rude
Sad about being at parramatta my god I hate it
Every single time I eat chicken in this house I get sick
