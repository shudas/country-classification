Sometimes heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants
Thanks for holding my blocks and cheering me on tonight! @AlexHarmon21
My night could not be going any worse
I get obsessive over my school work it's annoying.
Wish I had my best friend by my side.
For what relationship.. http://t.co/obZqvbeose
I only use my phone to call my mom.
Beyond excited to purchase @ShawnMendes new album #HandwrittenToNumber1
