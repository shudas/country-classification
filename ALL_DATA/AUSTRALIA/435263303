If I play Hold On Loosely and I don't see you tapping your foot or moving to the groove, I honestly don't think I can trust you.
I'm gonna be part of a Harry Potter themed weekend long 21st bday party. Can somebody summarize the whole story line to me real quick?
I don't think I've skipped Collie Man by Slightly Stoopid one single time.
How the lottery changed my life: I have enough money to buy all the tattoos I want.

Guy had his headphones so loud in the gym that we could all hear he was      pumping to sweet escape by Gwen Stefani. GOOD ON YA MATE.
One thing I've learned traveling... Most Asians OUTSIDE of Asia suck. I'm only talking 100% Asian though. Call me racist I don't care.
I have a Tapat√≠o tattoo... Do you really think I'm worried that I don't know what to do with my life yet? I'm only 22. üòÅ
It's the Chinese New Year. Who wants to get fucked up!?
The only way for me to resist drinking beer from the fridge is if there's no beer in the fridge.
Buying a one way ticket out of the country was the best decision I've ever made.
We all want something beautiful. Man, I wish I was beautiful.
Proud to be an American.
I still fear being buffaloed all the way down here in Australia.
Sydney's fucking tight but there are days when I miss riding around in @JHougum's Suby pumpin The Story So Far. #imissmahboi

Most Aussies don't like country music. This pleases me. üòé
Just remembered the I Spy books. Those were so freaking tight as a kid!
How cool would it be if you were actually a fan of U2 and their newest album was just on your phone for free? Cha feel?
Life is a damn beautiful thing.
I MEANT THEIR SNAPCHATS.
If you don't get a kick out of @AlHabitat and @jayykey_'s tweets you should just take a kick to the face instead.
It's insane that 2013 is over already.
Who do you miss more? Fav for me. RT for @cheinzz

Even Kahunas would do honestly.
Or a Maxwells burger minus the onion rings, and add BBQ Sauce w/tots.
Or Wildas.
Or a Whiskey River BBQ Burger from Red Robin.
If I got free tickets to the states and back but all I could do was eat one good burrito and come back I would do it. So worth +40 hours.
