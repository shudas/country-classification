But one more week and I'll be moved back home. #CloserToFriends
Welp. That didn't work out.
IM NERVOUS, SCARED, AND EXCITED ALL AT THE SAME TIME. #Canucks #StanleyCupPlayoffs #IShouldBeStudying
It's the little things that count. ☺️
Whhyyyyy is my upper back in intolerable pain? 😞
Can't wait for Thursday so I can go home for a couple days. 🙌
Not going to repeat last years mistake this month. It's taken too long to recover. Still unable to fully trust. 😔 #Regret
Crawling back in bed and cuddling with a pillow never felt so good. #FinalsStress
And just like that, I don't have a roommate anymore. 😞
Me: "what happens if I hangout with [name]"
D: "I don't think that will happen."
Probs not. Maybe it's best to go home on Thursday.
Somehow my room smells like weed. 
I don't smoke, and no one has brought any in here. 😭👃🏻
Why couldn't the psychology final exam be later and not tomorrow at 9am? 😓😭
"I swear every time I see you, you mention at least one new guy."
I do not! 😣
After beating up my 'brother'/close friend/your best friend after he's had a brain injury, you have the nerve to call me cutie? #FuckOff

Not wanting to take a melatonin every night, but not being able to fall asleep naturally. #SleepStruggles
I may be shy and socially awkward/anxious, but that does not mean I'm easy and lack self-respect.
I LEAVE FOR A FEW SECONDS AND CANUCKS SCORE TWICE. #fml
I'm so heartless and cold, sometimes I worry if I actually have any feelings left. 😕
Tomorrow's going to be a day where I'd rather stay in bed, but I have to go to a stupid concert/rave thing 😒 #Grumpy #NotLookingForwardToIt
Cuddling with strangers is not how I wanted to start my day off. 😣 #awkward
I meant it when I said "no" 😠

Awe, he's cute when he gets jealous. 😚
So careless 😔
Staples guy approaches. Looks like this psychotic hockey player I once knew. Still had a panic attack. #ptsd
Grandma: "Then he doesn't deserve it."
Nope, he doesn't.
First night of retrying melatonin. 😳 #SleepProblems
It's not because you care.
In order to know you have a heart, you have to get it broken? No thanks. 😒 #PlayItSafe
Mom: "Argh, piece of ham just fell on the floor"
Me: "Feed it to the imaginary dog"
Gma: "Feed it to Todd" #HerHumour 😳

#omg #GladShesHome #MissedHer
Coffee at church, coffee after church/before nap, coffee after nap. 😳☕️ #Yum
When you finally hangout with friends you haven't seen in a super long time. ☺️ #happy #FeelsGood #MissedThem
Two people talking to you at once is so uncomfortable. #Shhh
No longer a hostage!

Never dye your hair red, then a month later try and dye it to a blonde colour. #WeirdOrangeBrownHair #Oops
Literally scared the piss out of my mom. 😂 #GoodToBeHome
You know you're close to home when the first place you stop at you see someone you know. #SmallTownProblems
Going to get your heart broken. 😕 #advice
Elevators = automatic awkwardness
No sleep. Classes until 5pm today. 😳 #fun #coffee
Dad knows the games I watch on Sportsnet Now are on a delay so he phones every time Canucks score before I get to see it. 😒 #thanks
No philosophy journal tonight 🙌, so as soon as this game ends, it's bed time for sick miserable Mels Mel. 😷😴 #slowlydying
Thankful everyday for that extra stress I don't have to deal with. 🙌

Guy advice from my mom. #hilarious 😂 Then again she was with one guy for 20 years. 😳 Something must have worked out.

How did I not notice Tanev was left-handed when I got his autograph before?
Oh right, I was too worried about being stranded in Abbotsford.
#SorryNotSorry for all the Tanev content retweets. #HappyFan 😍😘
😓 of course

One of those days where coffee won't even get me out of bed. ☕️ #BackToSleep
Only one creeper thank goodness. 🙌

I do not want to wear a dress tonight. 😭👗 #outing
Sometimes liking someone isn't actually liiikkkiiiinnngggg the person. #DifferentLevels. 
Don't get ahead of yourself.
"If he asked you out, would you say yes?" 
"No" 
"Oh my gooood! Fuck both of you."
😂😂 #NotMyProblem
Broken down busses = the best. 🚍🚌
Probably so upset because it sounds like I'm not allowed to. 😒
I don't think I've ever been so hurt just for liking something/someone. 
Back to being heartless. 😞
Eye rape basically. 👀🙈
The amount of anxiety and panic I have when new people come in my room, is ridiculous.
I was really starting to like not having to share a bathroom with another girl. #NewRoommate 😣
I swear, every time I go shopping I always end up getting a new hoodie. 🙍
Mentally hungover. 😑😎
By far the most interesting night with @staplemeknot 😁 #SpontaneousAdventures #WithRandomGuys #SaintPatricksDay

No, he's not "ew." Unlike shallow girls who only care about a guys looks, some actually care more about ones personality. #rant 😔 #justsayin
Moment of bliss when putting on a new hoodie. 😍 #MayHaveAnAddiction
Exactly. "Humiliating"
Darlene's getting frustrated with all the guy friends I have and not being able to keep track of their names. 😂😂😂 #LessDrama #JustFriends

WHL players are so much more nicer to talk to than BCHL players. #generalization #1personsample
Paranoid moment when a guy yells to you: "Tiiiiindeeerrr" but it was most likely "Heeeey theeeeerree" #WalksAloneThroughCampus
Tough loss, crap refs. 😔
