I find it difficult to tweet when I'm in a good mood.
Shhhh, MacGyver's on.

If you kill me in your dreams I'm still alive in real life so jokes on you fuckwad.
Celebrating getting a job by drinking beer, playing Forza and listening to Conway Twitty.Queue up in an orderly fashion ladies.
Fucking stupid twitter telling me I'm not following people I fucking know,I am. Sort your shit out cunts.
I've just watched MacGyver make a hot air balloon out of rags while I was playing angry birds.
Pretty sure saying "Kill 'em, kill 'em all" may not have been the correct answer to "How would you like to handle neighbours?".Oh well.

Waking up with a hangover I can handle. But when I haven't had a drink, that fucking sucks.
If I could spend 1 hour with you that would be sweet. We could fuck 18 times.
I started a drinking game where I drank a beer everytime I wanted to swear. Long story short, I was drunk 7mins after waking up.
You're such a cliche its not even fucking funny.
What do you give the woman who has everything? Well antibiotics is a good start.
So apparently there is no correct way to tell a woman.....well, anything really.
Yeah, I did a tweet in the same vain last fucking week.
Time for another 3hrs tossing and turning and occasional sobbing.
On a serious note, what the fuck do you do when an ex calls out of the blue and wants to meet up? This shit has me vexed.
I'm a man trapped in a woman's body, fucking superglue in a tube similar to lube.
