When life gives you lemons and you don't like lemonade.
Rise Your Glass is the theme tune to my life.
At least I have @Eilidh_Beth to dance it out with
When life throws a spanner at your face.
Keep getting emails from Camp America saying my skill set is in high demand and I'll get paid more. It's tempting me more and more.
