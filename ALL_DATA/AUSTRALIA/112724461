Fun fact: if I see you parked in a disabled spot illegally, I will absolutely report it to the Police/Council. Jerks.

Just got Sony to replace my PS4 that was two months out of warranty. God bless Australian Consumer Protection laws, &amp; my knowledge thereof
And as someone who may have to try and help you, I implore you, IF IT'S FLOODED, FORGET IT
Hey fellow QLDers, put your phone on charge now, before it's too late, just in case
"Former Queensland Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie" Well isn't that a gorgeous sounding sentence
Hey @QPSmedia, I've seen this painted on the road in a few places, any idea of the meaning? http://t.co/GIhPThaOD7
"Malcolm Turnbull is holed up at his house tonight" - 7 News. Or, or, or, he's just at home?
At the interval I saw two ladies kissing and my first thought was "That's gay" 2nd thought was "To be honest, I expect that's the point"
Hells yeah, Eddie Izzard, let's go :D

To be fair though, it took three days. That cave was a REALLY good spot for hide and seek
My friends. Today I found Jesus. I'm so happy.
This PSA brought to you by me having an freaking terrible time at work. Well a very specific part of work. But enough to overshadow the rest
This is a PSA: If you break the law, please just admit to it. I'm talking big stuff like wilful damage &amp; assault, but most things too
Guys, I shouldn't really need to say it, but if you're thinking of drink driving, Don't. I'm not even going to tell you why, because duh
Oh also guess what? I got engaged yesterday :) http://t.co/DmjeRQYZKx

I just pulled my badge for the first time when not on duty. Amazing how nerve wracking it can be
Dear G20 protestors. Thank you for being awesome and peaceful and not being jerks by destroying my home city or hurting my co-workers
Happy "American holiday but fuck it, let's dress up sexy and get drink" day

I got my diploma the other day! I'm no longer just a uni dropout, I've now got a bit of paper with words on it. Huzzah!
Seeing @BillBailey the other night in Brisbane was not bad at all, all things considered

and no one can be bothered to get it out 2/2
Brilliant quote from @BillBailey last night: Tony Abbott is like a plastic bag in a tree. No one knows how it got there, 1/2

Good news! We went out last night for the first time in a while, and I'm not hungover! Maybe a little... fuzzy all over though
Oh FFS. Kels' dad has moved from watching Sky News non stop to watching... Fox News. *sobs quietly*
And yet no War on Climate Change... @ScottRhodie: Obama says climate change is a bigger threat than terrorismâ€¦ http://t.co/9QqbvOEWaP
Getting paid to walk around a park and listen to Something for Kate play live. Geez this is a good job sometimes
So I'd like to know if @JohnBirmingham predicted the caliphate, or if they read his book and got the idea that way
Ummm, @ABCNews24, I think someone has fallen asleep on your soundboard, it's severely out of sync
Hey let's watch Tron Legacy! OH GOD CGI JEFF BRIDGES I FORGOT THE HORROR
Ugh Mondays am I right? Oh no wait, it's my weekend. Never mind
Anyone else thinking of heading to the @QPSmedia #QPexpo tomorrow?
Is anyone else watching the greatest movie ever sold on SBS2? It's fascinating. Gee @morganspurlock makes some good films
