A Letter to the King
Mine and @Ballislife4432 's personal finance PowerPoint might out an end to all PowerPoints. The game has changed! 😂
I hope Rose is 100% throughout playoffs. Bulls are a big threat if he is.
Warriors w/o Curry: Playoffs
Rockets w/o Harden: Maybe playoffs 
Pelicans w/o Davis and Thunder w/o Westbrook: lottery picks
But at the same time, AD carried his squad too. And they ARE in the playoffs.
Look at the people around Westbrook though. He carried that team to a successful record, despite missing playoffs. MVP worthy.
We need to remove the lines from the court! They're endangering our officials! 😉😂 https://t.co/JE7GqlgJNq
NBA needs to abandon the 8 East / 8 West and make it top 16. Teams in the East just aren't good enough for playoffs.
Honestly am ok with Swaggy leaving. Seems like nothing but a distraction.
Why are so many stereotypes true? 😂 (cc. @LakersReporter ) http://t.co/br4DprUQoD
The Game's albums get pushed back more than LeBron's hairline.
Bet Play Thompson doesn't break 50
IMO Thunder make playoffs: Westbrook MVP. Pelicans make playoffs: Harden MVP
49% (above average) but you're too focused on the attempts. He can take 100 shots if he's hitting them.
"@OrlandoMagic: .@VicOladipo rejects Dwyane Wade! 😱 #PureMagic https://t.co/JEKDfZKEIx" @Mateo_G23 🙊🙈

My nephew gets in my face and says "I'm a dolphin. Eeee eeeeee eeee!" 😂
Plot twist: Hillary Clinton chooses Monica Lewinsky as her Vice President for 2016 election.
SwizZz's flow in Funk Volume 2013 is dope.

Hey, we're not 5 years old. If you want us to act like young adults, treat us like young adults.

Other than THE John Wooden, Coach K is the best college basketball coach ever.

You love so much, you love when love hurts.
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt?
It'd be so fun to be that white kid on the end of a good D1 team's bench.
But with all that being said, congrats Coach K, hope to see you team you with Bill Self in Kansas one day. 😏
You know you're an idiot when you start 💩 and then YOU block the person you try to start 💩 with. 😂 @vestal88 ladies and gents.
Hey @Duke_MBB , guess who else has 5 national championships?
Plot twist: Best of 3 series. Game 2 tomorrow.
Those refs should lose their NCAA licenses.
#DuckFuke
Who shoots that shot?
But refs don't Love Duke. Noooo...
I'd still rather have Okafor though.
Kaminsky will be like a Dirk in the NBA. Stretch 4.
Plot twist: Paul Walker's death was faked in order to boost ticket sales to the final Fast &amp; Furious.

2. I hate Duke
3. I hate Duke
4. I hate Duke
5. I hate Duke

Watching the Donald Trump Roasted and @SethMacFarlane called him the 2nd worst New York tragedy 😂
Infinite respect for @UKCoachCalipari for this. Love it. https://t.co/GJMXA2UPPA
The international symbol for love is a heart. I think it should be changed to a Pizza Roll.

Happy birthday @Jessi_Stratton 🎉
It's cooler to be on probation than it is being accepted to college nowadays. It's sad.

Sometimes I get confused whether I'm walking through the HHS hallways, or if I'm at a concert.
That Taco Bell commercial 😂
"...Respected." 😂😂😂
Holocaust jokes!
USA! USA! USA!
Moment I've been waiting for... Jeff Ross!
Martha is 73 and I have a hard time believing it.
