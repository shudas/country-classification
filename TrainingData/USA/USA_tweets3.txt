You better chill out or we're gonna have problems.
what is life
So happy to have friends that I can tell anything
I try so hard, but it's never good enough.
Why am I so unproductive?
Sincerity makes all the difference.
I've got SO MUCH ON MY PLATE right now
So this is what growing up feels like...
What's the point of a weekend when all I'll be doing is homework anyway
My curious mind is bound to get me in trouble.
I have no thoughts towards Valentine's Day this year tbh
why are dreams so weird
Patiently waiting.
I can't handle all of the complaining.
Teachers tell us to go to bed early, yet they give us homework that'll keep us up till 1:00 am.
what is sleep
I definitely need to step up my game.
I feel like I have no one to turn to.
I've spent a good four hours teaching myself the chemistry that my teacher failed to do.
My break has been so unproductive it's sad
Irish win in OT baby! #MarchMadness

Whenever I talk about painting my heart pumps a bit more rapidly &amp; my hands have the urge to just dance w the paintbrush...

Art has shown me so much about life....
Love love love https://t.co/q7Q6bdjSYP
A positive outlook in a negative reality
Following my path that will lead me to true happiness 
I'm sure of that
I love jellyfish b/c they move so freely and majestic like if something good is about to happen
Time is so important in life..
No more avoiding the truth
Gotta listen to this signs...
Its time to let go...
I want to sing my heart out and cry my eyes out...
I'm so happy what God has given me in my life even though I do questionate at times but in the end it is what i always wanted...
Your not worth my time anymore...
Meeting new people is meeting a new you
I get deep that's just me
I took that desicion because it was going to benefit the both of us....
"@_rosekthleen: @kimmy_mata it's not healthy for soulmates to be apart for so long" no its not i agree it way worse than a heartbreak
bby you introduced the best of me...
You're history darling...
No biggy tbh... i knew this was going to happen
Not in that way
You will never know that feeling

Reminder that the Rock is in preposterous shape and didn't have the cardio for wrestling.
Reminder that I was like one of six people on Earth who thought I WANT TO BELIEVE was a good movie.
There are few "show returns" I'd be excited to see. The motherfucking X-FILES is on that short list.
PAUL BLART MALL COP 2 chose "Lapdance" as their trailer theme?!?
DAMNIT @DESOLATEJ YOU MADE ME MISS JEOPARDY
This place is 25 a month, and I get to do it with my good friend so it's fun and educational and productive.
I've had a fucked up joint in my back for years now, and physical therapy was rudimentary gym work and a heat pad for $55 a week.
it's one of many things in my life I am deeming unacceptable and taking steps to fix. This was a positive day.
I'm naturally athletic and naturally strong, I'm just let it atrophy to the point of embarrassment. Unacceptable.
Day 1 at the gym done. 2 hours of leg and back work with my man @DesolateJ. It's a start, man. It's a fuckin' start. :)
I'M AT THE GYM FUCKERS
Officially set up something important for my physical and social health today. Important. Positive.

I ask too much from you, bc I had it before..
I'm actually pretty upset. I'm just gonna take a nap and hope I get out of this mood.
When I tell you I'm bored, I'm pretty much asking you to come over.
Last night was some all bullshit
Today just needs to be over with tbh
Heard my name around the city boy you know that's me
My temper has been wild today
I'm ready to go the fuck off on someone
Bro y'all piss me off
You should never pick a boyfriend over your friends that's what some bitches dont get
I've been realizing so much
Do you ever look back and realize how happy someone made you
100 hunnid // k camp
I don't let what People say about me get to me,  I know me.
Why should I worry about the past when there is so much in store for me in the future.
I'm third wheelin like a mf
I'm tired and just want to go home
How you gon makes these girls feel like you want em for a relationship and not even want a relationship.

Have you ever been so tired that your body forces you to sleep? I haven't given up, my body has just given out. Know the difference,
I look and feel like death. Sincerest apologies.
What time do you have to be missing out on what you want most. Give life the best you can give, and it will return to you the love. #APLit
We have a limited time to love, so please don't be coy. I want to admire your beauty before it is too late. Let us make memories. #aplit
I will not ret rest until I hear your voice again..
I love body butter but it never seems to soak in...
I am having lots of philosophical and scientific thoughts and curiosity tonight.
My mind was opened, I believe.
Damn it my lighter broke.
I am not the biggest fan of being shoved to the back burner.
