Dont get me wrong costumes in movies dont have to be 100% like the comics. But I see nothing similar except the colour red
So here is a thought.  How come no one kicked up a fusd over Scarlet Witches costume not being like the comics? I mean at all like the comic
just because someone says something a bit riskay does not automatically make them sexist.
I dont see how jurassic world "chris pratt" character is any different from Tony Stark. Is tge Avengers sexist?
"Men.. We know how to be friends"
You would think the White House would of heard of the EQUAL PAY ACT #EqualPayDay http://t.co/jUvGBskaw9
Also. I have no issue Damsels in distress. Its not saying all women are helpless. Just some For every Peach there is a Samus
Well that was a rant. Back to work. Nothing to see here
You can have both intelligent and violence in the same story
What you want is intulectual stuff. We have that too. Again Bioshock has an intelligent story. But you are too concerned with violence
You deem sex killing and fighting immature. Despite the fact that stuff is the mature stuff.
I mean seriously tell me the Bioshock series is immature.  Sure there are kid games.  Which there should be. But there is plenty of mature
Hell I dont even get the argument. Games need to grow up either. They already have. You just dont like it
I dont get this argument
&gt; sex in games is immature

So you are saying sex is kids stuff?
