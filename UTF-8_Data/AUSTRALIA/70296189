What an amazing show @Cirque are putting on in Brisbane tonight.  It's FANTASTIC #TOTEM #fb
Some parts of my job are boring as.  But listening to @BradButcherHQ new album helps me get through the day. #Jamestown #fb

On my way to see @BradButcherHQ smash out some tunes from his new album. Cannot wait.
