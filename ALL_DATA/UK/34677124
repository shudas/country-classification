What a dumb ass question
Milliband just spoke some truth #BBCDebate
Hmmmm I don't know about getting rid of nuclear weapons 

Surely if we don't have any we're just a massive target ?
LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE YOU MAD
"Immigrants caused that problem"

Change the fucking tune Nigel
Where the fuck is David Cameron to? 

But rude.

All this negativity is coming back
Guess we're not talking tonight then 

Again.
Indirect tweets 😒😒😒😒
Going to have an all nighter and prepare for college tomorrow
No offence guys
My Twitter feed is so boring
So sleepy
Heated conversations about why horse racing is cruel
I'm totally for everyone expressing themselves how they like but,

Doubling up false eye lashes on your top row just looks odd to me
I feel like I'm wasting my life
It's sunny and I like that
Alex brought me this bc he remembered my fav Pokemon 

My homies &gt; your homies http://t.co/bdxL62N9lU

So proud of you girlie 💖

Genuinely such a beautiful day in Bristol 👌
I feel like I'm trying for nothing now
Lately it feels like every time we talk you upset me. You don't want us to be happy anymore.
So pissed off

I miss @Cas_Audio so damn much 

I need my amigo back 💔
At a point in my life where I'm so proud that only few people can dull my positivity but you've gone and done just that
I thought today was going to be a good one but you've managed to kill my vibe
There's no trust here
Just take the compliment
I swear Jack is like my hero. Ha forever saving me from being a homeless lady. 

Top lad 👌

"No officer. It's hi, how are you ?"
Loriens actually the sweetest
How
I have no money but some how manage to spend lots
Happy birthday Grace 👌💖💉
Fucking hate Sunday's
Sad
Angry
You've been fucking spoilt. In this position for no reason and you lash out at me for trying to give you something I never had? bitch.
Actually being through shit I have and dealing with everything with minimal support I know exactly what it's like
How dare you try to tell me that I don't understand. I'm the only person in this place who understands. Stupid bitch.
Picking up Alice tomorrow to stay with me for a few days 💘💘💘
Had enough of you
Stop.
You're so desperate.
Well that was an interesting FaceTime from Dan Jessie and Lorien 😂👌💖
