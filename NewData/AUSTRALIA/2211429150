Yes o yes the nightmare is over! Happy with any of the remaining teams winning now #mkr
2 bad dishes, please of please send cruella deville home #mkr
Wish Kat wouldn't revel in others misfortune #mkr
Nothing about Kat screams '10's' #mkr
Stephen Curry #KiaMVP
Still crossing fingers that #Katastrophe and #1taskandre are the ones going home but I don't think so #mkr
Oh no, bad gnocchi, not a great start #mkr #Katastrophe ;)
Finally!! The Kat show may come to and end!! #mkr
If drasko cooked rather than explained every detail, they'd have tons of time #mkr
Hopefully this #Katastrophe is Katastophic and sends them into sudden death #mkr
Carlton fans crying into their latte's watching their former key forwards kicking goals in other jumpers
Didn't think the man crush could get worse but it has, Ambrose looks better in no. 29 @EssendonFC #DonTheSash #garymoorcroftno1fan
Kid can play but please someone feed Marty Gleeson @EssendonFC #DonTheSash
Love our hands in close! Very cat-like during their dominance, are we sure 'bomber' isn't still there @EssendonFC #DonTheSash
So many bomber tackles not getting rewarded, what do we have to do @EssendonFC #DonTheSash
Love watching monfries deliver to Ryder, only problem is they are both in the wrong colours #AFLPowerSwans #stillbombers
Just funny watching Josh Kennedy destroying the blues, when he's exactly what they need #karma #noforwardline
Kat &amp; Andre are better than Neo from the matrix, can dodge so many bullets #mkr #skatingthrough
Kat, stop yelling! No one is listening!! #mkr
Put drasko and Kat in a team together, nothing would get cooked #mkr
Sure Emma thinks she's on a dating show, not a cooking show #mkr
At least no more tennis puns #mkr bye carol &amp; Adam
