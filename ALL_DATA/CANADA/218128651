#createdmonster
I'm way fucked
I'm ready for bed😴
some kid just rode his bike by my house yelling Maddie is a loser😅😅
I'm not nice
the hardest part of my day is deciding which scrunchie to use
you know it's too cold when you're glasses fog up when you get on the bus
cutting it close once again😌 http://t.co/um9CY62wwW

it's really embarrassing walking to school with a badminton racket
I just want to play tennis right now😩😭
what the heck are the emojis on snapchat??¿?¿??
time flies when you're a piece of shit☺️
I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to burn because it hurts like a bitch
I hope the thought of me keeps you awake at night
Deeg is a good fucking dancer💃👯
why even get my hopes up😋
yelling at me is not going to help anything
if you acted you're own age you'd buck up and tag me in the tweet😌
to start my homework or keep watching suits😩
"Henry's the real shuttle cock here"
Deeg: 1 Brink(low): 0
you piss me off and I don't even know you wtf
I love chemistry but I hate it because it is way too much work
crying because it's almost 11 and I still have so much work to do
death by homework overload
late night calls with Deeg&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I love anything lemon flavoured just not lemons
I miss europe
it feels like 3:30 am 😴
a pound a day oops
I slept in the hallway
"shave your lamb chops"
9hourflight🔫
I still haven't finished packing
best never
oops
fck the five qualifiers
fuck you Geoff
not ready for bio tomorrow😒🔫
still procrastinating to do my prelabs🔫
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with someone new
this is a no sleep kind of night
let my body be your wonderland
you know she wants your hog when she cleans your truck
fuck Jeff the intern
I don't hit kids but I could hit all 19 of these ones🔫😋
boys with straight teeth&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
no motivation for bio😴
happy birthday!! miss you @pri_aduvala
shit happens eh
all I want is panera
the colour of the dress is on the news, this has gone way to far
the fact that I have to be up in 5 hours makes me want to cry
chemistry makes me want to die😄
20/20 vision is pretty cool
I'm going to be late because my papa loves a clean windshield😒
not looking forwards to walking in the snow
my work ethic is lower than the temperature outside
corrupted
I don't like when bad things happen to my best friend
I need to stop saving everything until the last minute🔫🔫
I'm so happy I have until midnight to hand in my chem lab🙌
I procrastinate way too much
the bags under my eyes are designer
rough day
consistency is key
Sara is gross😷
don't hate on my bæ, fuckers http://t.co/vDwrZ8b28i
I wish my dad lived at home😩😭 missing him like crazy
