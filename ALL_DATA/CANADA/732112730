What happens when people watch Spartan High School style #worstvideoontheinternet http://t.co/BwEUCnFAEZ
This entire day has just been a monumental waste of time #whencanisleep
Hab fans be like: Stone was faking! https://t.co/X4HuqrSMvx
Me: "What's so funny?"
@Becca_Babyy07: "I'm tired. And kids getting hit by buses are funny."
O.O
Too soon? Maybe. Hilarious? Absolutely. http://t.co/U53vqXWYxJ
Annnnnd that caps off a brutal night. GG, Blue Jays.
Yeah, I'm probably gonna catch a convenient flu tonight. Not down for this poetry B.S.
Actually so pissed off, I'm gonna be physically sick
ðŸ˜‘ðŸ”«
Well, that was an interesting version of O Canada. @CoDunnn http://t.co/E5l22CCQ6d
F*CK
I swear, if I see another base hit up the middle taken away by one of those stupid shifts, I'm gonna kick my TV through the wall.
That's the first time I've ever seen Dickey get mad.
Pay this man whatever he wants, @Senators http://t.co/8SZyBZZMtR
WHOOOOOOO!!!
Ryan White really seems to enjoy getting his ass kicked by the Sens, doesn't he?
That's it Boston and New York. Wear down your bullpens.
After school naps ðŸ‘Œ
Screw you, A-Fraud
Tough break. Condra's probably one of the last guys on the team you'd want on a breakaway for you
Wtf, Florida? @Becca_Babyy07 http://t.co/JgEzuV17mn
Have to do poetry for English class. Tempted to steal the Jonah Hill slam poetry scene from 22 Jump Street #JesusdiedforourCynthias
Saw quite possibly the best Sens game of the year @JustinShimizu97 @CoDunnn
Highway robbery by the Padres. It's gonna be a long year for the Braves.
Ottawa, April Fool's was yesterday. Stop it.
Well played, YouTube. #AprilFools http://t.co/4SJwhz1KKo
Cressman is a gem #Merivale http://t.co/eesophUpG2
So this just happened... #whoisthis #wtf http://t.co/OOw9UbaFQD
Out of all the players on the Leafs, I probably have the least respect for Nazem Kadri #scumbag
Are you shitting me?
Kypreos just said Mark Stone has a shot at a 40-goal season. I will cry of happiness if that ever happens.
Prayers up

The Cold War was pretty much two entire countries standing toe-to-toe yelling "swing first!" for 45 years #Brettthoughts
Pageaaaau! Pageau, Pageau, Pageau! Pageaaaau! Pageaaaaaau!
As if @JustinShimizu97's dad is #1 in the world at Candy Crush #champ
(@CoDunnn and I in class)
Him: F*** this, I'm not doing this
Me: Can I borrow your pen then?
Him: ...I was gonna ask you for one
#senioritis
Stepping outside to run and realizing that it's -15 #areyoushittingme #Canadaproblems
Hey, Kessel! Now's your chance!
ATTA BOY, BORO!!
Will never be able to understand how people actually enjoy listening to Bob Cole.
Habs-Sharks on #HNIC instead of Sens-Leafs? That is some grade-A bullshit.
Well. Now I know where she gets the chirps from #thankstony http://t.co/UJgKWmybbf
Thought I was exaggerating when I said "literally"? http://t.co/JaylKrIMi3
When you actually have the motivation to cook a full meal but there's literally nothing in the fridge #rattled #firstworldproblems

I swear, I see more Jays fans in Central Florida than I do in Ottawa #wtf
The amount of Blue Jays fans down here in Orlando is startling.
Well, at least one of us had fun @AleksFronc http://t.co/UHC7HDlVsE
Listening to a couple trying to convince their crying daughter (can't be older than 5) that she's gonna love Splash Mountain ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Œ
Every time my mom gets on my case about being on my phone, I'm that much more tempted to tell her it's better company than she is.
Fuck
Just chilling with my bud Mickey Mouse http://t.co/ReFXryTdlg
Not a #TransformationTuesday, but felt like posting this. Once again, thank you, puberty. http://t.co/FI1pe4kwGH
Kreider and MSL on that last rush. So much speed #holyshit
I swear, the Jays are gonna be what drives me to start drinking
"@96Nellis: How am I supposed to write this article through tears? #Jays #MLB" F*CK
Never realized how brutal The Day After Tomorrow was until now.
Being on my own ain't so bad http://t.co/iTiCelRwFY
Words cannot describe how much I despise Belden and that sleazy rat from Internal Affairs #ChicagoPD
That moment of sheer terror when your keys aren't in your pocket #heartattack
All set up for tonight #ChicagoPD http://t.co/xjxulDwy13
There's a boxset of the first 5 seasons of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers right in front of me at Jumbo Video. So much temptation...
As if the new rice cooker plays "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" when you hit the cook button #justasianthings
Phone just went off in front of my dad. Bobby Shmurda was my ringtone. Can't remember the last time my old man looked so disappointed #oops
Quite possibly the most Asian thing I've seen in my life @Xiaoyuhu87 http://t.co/j1sbsZDCaj
That feel when your headphone dies in the middle of your workout ðŸ˜­ #rattled
Rangers got robbed
