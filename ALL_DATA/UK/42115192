Yer da watching as yer ma and her mates head to the Savoy for the night. http://t.co/Cc2lYKxOuE
Sat down in the pub, next guy along starts telling me how he was released from the local psychiatric ward the other day.

Good start.
The fabrics of Rangers Football Club fought to rid Ibrox of Mike Ashley's undue influence. It's only fair that the punishment is minimal.
I'm quite confident there's some 300 year old law which makes it illegal to turn down a pint on a day like today.
Watching a programme called Dinner Date and eating a microwave carbonara. Never want the student life to end.
Yes, this fixture mix-up has been embarrassment, but it's just as big as embarrassment if you think this was all to simply aid Rangers.

Stewart Regan unnecessarily sticking his foot in it with those King comments. What's the point in commenting when the process is ongoing?
Don't like the new strips at all. I'll have no issue with not buying them!
Jut described going to bed now as an "early night". My body is ruined.
Still gutted about this. http://t.co/doplnBluhA http://t.co/MoCv6CSHC8
Fair play to anyone going to Dumbarton at the weekend, where you'll witness a repeat of tonight's game.
Sent away my @WATP_Magazine with the phrase "rejuvenated chances of promotion". I'll be a laughing stock by the time it's printed.
This is the sort of game where Rangers should be racking up the goals. But for reasons unknown, you just knew it was going to be a struggle.
Turn up at the library, raring to go, to find out it closes at 9pm during the holidays. 

Must. Not. Pub. Instead.
Leigh Griffiths - more court appearances than goals.
You know how people say, "Aw that felt great" after the gym? Well they're bloody lying.

"Should probably get up and do something."

My epitaph.
Watching some random BBC show on Netflix called The Wrong Man. It's the second thing in a row with James Corden. He's bloody everywhere.
After a week away, two more nights out and a 3 course meal I'm back to the gym tomorrow. As much energy as an Ally McCoist training session.
A healthy profit from that 0-0 draw. http://t.co/eGLl7uHVTJ
So what did you achieve today? http://t.co/1oGiFAVQzv
One of the Chuckle Brothers and Liam Gallagher. That's the dream. Might get it framed. https://t.co/PBf3MPSO90
Thought I didn't get paid til next Friday, turns out it's actually this Friday. http://t.co/m6AEPoG20P
That St Mirren team is a shambles. Think it could be a good few years before we see them in the top league again.
Clegg says he won't work with the Tories if they go ahead with Â£12bn of welfare cuts.

So that'll be 5 more years of Tory/Lib Dems then.
If I could write 1500 words about History as quickly as I can write 1500 words about Rangers, this degree would've been much easier.

Lost my voice. Brilliant. Good job I can still share all my great ideas via twitter.
Stuart McCall last night said Rangers need to get back to a time of players wanting to come to the club for reasons other than cash.
Anyone recommend a good holiday spot for a group my age, without being one of the mental party places?
I think everyone I've met off twitter has commented on my height. Do I come across as sounding particularly small?

Yer da's front door. http://t.co/RrUX56r1VM
Back to work tonight and back to essays and the gym tomorrow. http://t.co/hJb4SdV7if
Great to see Nicky Clark racking up a few goals.
Sharpening up before the RST dinner with @John20Hooper. Planning to have a serious chat with McCall about Mohsni. http://t.co/GcZIMbWPrd
After 2 cups of water and 20 minutes of ironing, I think my shirt is ready.

"Easy iron" my arse.
Really looking forward to the @RangersFCTrust dinner tonight with some top people.
Almost had something in my eye watching last night's Eastenders...
That's @rossejhendry. Not only a Canuck, but a prime opener of canner worms.
