Well done the Aussies #WorldCup2015 üòäüëç
About bloody time #winning #draws http://t.co/Y0L13W6cm9
In the BBL Pietersen and Luke Wright performed yet neither of them were anywhere near the World Cup team. @ECB_cricket needs to look at that
So the football World Cup was a joke last year and now it's the cricket! At least the curling championships are on soon
Embarrassing @ECB_cricket get rid of Morgan and Moores #ENGvBAN
Eden Park is like playing at @Ticknallcc ! #tiny #sixesgalore #CWC15 #AUSvNZ
There will be some big, big sixes in the cricket today #AUSvNZ #WorldCup2015
Too early üò™
6th place! Thanks for all the support #voteziggy #ziggy #koala
All the voters out there #voteziggy
Trainers have finally worn out! Time to invest in a pair of @newbalance #sneakers #sneaky
Looking at flights from Australia to England if @WFCOfficial get to Wembley #dreaming #saddlers
Waking up at 6.50 on a Sunday morning #farmlife
Pleasure playing with the Stags this year! Good luck last six games #kickon #bigbadwolf #bantertogether @DunstallCC
Next stop Birmingham! Wonder what @daylestancliffe @Ryanlk92 @SamBuck9 have in store? #bullyamos
I have a 1/3 chance of playing in the right side this weekend #anychance
Well bowled Treebeard! Getting better and better each game! #lordofthespin
Can my boys win tonight to take the league??? #mandlebergsboys #underseventeens #bantertogether
"I've seen less hookers in soho on a Saturday night" unbelievable quote from Bob Willis about England's batting #hookersandcoke #steadyonbob
Some of the worst cricket I've ever seen!!!  #EngvInd
Prior has to go! What terrible cricket from England that was! #buttlerin
I really am dreading golf next week...I am awful! @jonnyhickman6 can I just be your caddy? #firstworldproblems
Joe Root imitating Gary Ballance swinging his shirt topless on the balcony when he got his ton... #banter
Robson loves a loose drive #classic
Yes Germany won the World Cup but surely the biggest news is Alistair Cook got a Wicket #ridiculous
Best tea I've ever had yesterday! #unreal http://t.co/vi1VJPvxSi
#beachbodysunday @JonoParkinson
Awful news this morning üòü top top lad!
First time in Etwall and I'm not bladdered
Playing second team for the first time since 2009...wow
Fair play USA! Best game of the World Cup so far #USAvsBEL #WorldCup2014
Price boost Samaras to score first 9/1 worth a Tenner! #notlikely
Strike Dos Santos! Must be unbearable to play in #heat
Enjoying this!!!
Can't believe we raised ¬£3000 at Dunstall last night! Unbelievable scenes!!!
Wow...interesting selection #stillhopeformandleberg
Injured again...what a season I'm having #DarrenAnderton
Tom Bradshaw another young striker who will play for two years, be decent and then he will sign for someone else... #saddlers #SameEveryYear
Red cards rev my engine! But they don't belong in the news room
Hondorus are pure thugs! #WorldCup2014
Note to self don't use your head to catch a ball at slip #bruised #headache
They don't call me a hero for nothing... #striking http://t.co/xxDvKVzMGQ
Finally back to scoring runs #overdue
How is @tomknight28 batting at 3? #pinchhitter #knightofdeath
19 league runs this season...god I'm shit #timetoquit
My bowling comeback has taken it's toll! 5 overs on sunday and I'm still wrecked #ohdear
Poor from Real there! #GodinTheGod
Any danger of these antibiotics working? #nightmare #pilldropping
Really hot day and I'm having a bath to soothe my leg #thuglife
Another seven days worth of antibiotics #killmenow #drugaddict
Fantasy team selected! Congratulations Knighty you've made the cut @tomknight28 #boarsnostags http://t.co/qZUt2kM81L
Glenn Maxwell is out of this world #PepsiIPL
Hate having a bastard blood infection! Whole leg completely ruined üëé #badtimes http://t.co/spEkfBxxp4
I've been at it again and forgotten pants and socks to work #commando #blisteredfeet #whenwillitend
Ankles fucked again #cheersclewers
Cricket is the winner today already! What a  cracking day!!! Up the boys
Quiz winners selfie @LouiseBrodrick @SuziQ79 #winning #dunstallwidows http://t.co/T7eOtc8WpA
Massive thanks for everyone who came to 'Quiz of Legends' at @DunstallCC tonight! Was nerve racking but brilliant #firstquiz #wentwell #
Good luck @DunstallCC today! Not with the boys but have the team to succeed #oneteamonedream
#cardinalburns
Bladdered in Alsager! One of the greats #bankcorner
Going to be struggling at this time on Sunday @LilliMoulton
What is the world coming too #retweetrubbish
Should have kept the back room staff! Moyes would have had a bit more success possibly #maybe
Got to blame the board for not bringing in new faces! RVP the only decent one brought in before Moyes took over
Maxwell is ridiculous #shotpal
If they ever brought back The Shield like they have done with 24 I would go nuts #StinksOfBrilliance
